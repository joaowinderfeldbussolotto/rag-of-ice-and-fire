Three 
rangers
 of the 
Night's Watch
 are tracking a group of 
wildling
 raiders 
beyond the Wall
, and encounter the
Others
, who had not been seen for eight thousand years.
Synopsis
Gared
, 
Will
, and 
Ser
 
Waymar Royce
, three 
rangers
 from the 
Night's Watch
, are tracking a band of 
wildling
 raiders
in the 
haunted forest
. Will has reported on wildlings that he found, claiming they are all dead. Gared, an older man
who has been in the Night's Watch for decades, is uneasy, and insists that they turn back to the 
Wall
; they have eight
or nine days of travel ahead of them, which can turn into a fortnight if it snows. Waymar, a noble born youth of
eighteen, however, has the command, and after making light of Gared's fears asks Will again for the details of what
he saw.
Will explains that he saw the wildlings' encampment. Their lean-to was covered by snow, they had no fire, and none
of the wildlings moved the entire time he was watching. They were lying on the ground as if dead, but no blood was
visible. Waymar suggests they might have been sleeping, but Will insists they are dead. There was also a woman up
in a tree, but she did not move either. Gared suggests the wildlings must have been killed by the cold, but Waymar
points out that the weather has not been cold enough to freeze men like that. He asks Will to lead them to the dead
wildlings.
With night falling, the rangers ride back to the wildling camp. Both Will and Gared sense something is wrong, but
Waymar mocks them again and commands Gared to stay behind to guard the 
horses
. When Gared suggests starting a
fire, Waymar sardonically orders him not to. Will fears that Waymar's insolence will provoke Gared into drawing
his sword, but Gared eventually acquiesces and no fire is lit.
Will and Waymar climb up the ridge, Waymar much noisier than Will. When Will reaches his previous vantage
point, he sees that the bodies are gone. Waymar, walking upright, reaches the top of the ridge and stands in plain
sight. Will warns Waymar to get down, but Waymar just laughs. Determined to find the wildlings and make his first
ranging a success, Waymar orders Will to climb a tree and look for a fire.
Will reluctantly climbs a nearby 
sentinel
 tree. Below him, Waymar challenges an unseen foe. Will thinks he sees a
white shadow moving below, but is not sure. He is about to call down a warning, but stops, unsure. Waymar calls to
Will with unease in his voice as he turns in a circle with his sword drawn, and asks about the sudden cold, which
Will also feels.
An 
Other
 emerges from the woods: tall, gaunt, and white, dappled with a gray-green shimmer. Waymar nervously
commands it to come no further and prepares himself for battle, challenging the Other to "dance" with him. Will
notes that Waymar, in that moment, is no longer a boy, but truly a man of the Night's Watch. When more Others
appear among the trees, Will considers calling out a warning, but decides not to do so, as it would require him to
reveal his position. The sword of the first Other is made of inhumanly-sharp translucent crystal. Waymar is able to
check the oncoming blows until his parry comes a bit too late and the Other's sword cuts through the mail under his
arm. Waymar screams "For 
Robert
!" and charges, but as his blade strikes the Other's sword, it shatters. One of the
shards hits Waymar's left eye and he falls to his knees, blinded. All of the Others move in and slash at him
mercilessly.
Will turns his head away for a long time before looking back to see that the Others are gone. When he finally dares,
Will climbs down, examines Royce's body, then picks up the knight's twisted and broken sword. He decides to bring
it back to show to their commanders, hoping Gared is still with the horses. When Will stands up again, Waymar 
has

risen
 and is standing over him. His remaining eye has turned blue. With an icy cold touch, Waymar's hands go
around Will's throat.

Bran II
Lord 
Eddard Stark
 dispenses justice to a 
Night's Watch
 deserter. When they are on their way back to 
Winterfell
, and
Jon Snow
 and 
Robb Stark
 find six orphaned 
direwolf
 pups.
Synopsis
It is the ninth year of summer Seven-year-old 
Bran Stark
 is traveling with a party of twenty men, including his father
Lord 
Eddard Stark
, to see the king's justice done. This is the first time that he is allowed to join. Bran's older brother
Robb
 thinks the man to be executed must be a 
wildling
 sworn to 
Mance Rayder
, the 
King-Beyond-the-Wall
, which
makes Bran think of the tales Old 
Nan
 has told him about wildlings.
The 
offender
 turns out to be an old man dressed in the ragged blacks of the 
Night's Watch
 who has lost his ears and
a finger to frostbite. Lord Eddard questions the man briefly. Then two guardsmen drag the man to the stump of a tree
and 
Theon Greyjoy
, Eddard's ward, brings Eddard his 
Valyrian steel
 sword, 
Ice
. Eddard pronounces the sentence
(desertion of the Night's Watch is punished by death) and raises the blade. 
Jon Snow
, Bran's 
bastard
 brother,
reminds Bran not look away and so Bran watches as his father strikes off the man's head with a single stroke. The
head lands near Theon, who laughs and kicks it away. Jon calls Theon an ass under his breath and compliments Bran
on his poise during the execution.
On the way back to 
Winterfell
, Robb and Jon argue about whether or not the deserter died bravely before racing
their horses to the bridge, leaving Bran and his pony behind. Eddard rides up and asks if Bran knows why he
executed the man himself. Bran replies that the man was a wildling. Eddard corrects that the man was a deserter,
then explains that the 
First Men
 – of whom the 
Starks
 descendant – believed that the man who passes the sentence
should perform the execution himself, lest he become too comfortable with ordering deaths; the Starks still hold to
that principle.
Jon calls from up ahead for them to come see what he and Robb have found. They find Robb holding something in
his arms next to the corpse of a wolf larger than Bran's pony. Jon correctly identifies the corpse as a 
direwolf
. Theon
comments that direwolves have not been seen south of 
the Wall
 for two hundred years. Bran then notices that Robb
is cradling a small pup, and gives it a stroke after Robb reassures him. Then Jon gives him another pup.
When they inspect the mother's corpse, they find a large piece of shattered antler lodged in her throat. The soldiers
in the company feel this to be a bad omen. Theon offers to kill the pups but Bran protests. Eddard initially states
killing them would be best but changes his mind when Jon points out that there are five pups, one for each of
Eddard's legitimate children; since the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, they must be meant to have the wolves.
Bran immediately realizes, along with everyone else, that the comparison only works because Jon is not claiming a
pup for himself.
Robb and Bran both declare that they are willing to nurse their pups by hand themselves. Eddard stresses that the
children must feed and raise the pups themselves, not pass them off to the servants, and must treat them well lest
they become dangerous. Both Robb and Bran state they will not allow the pups to die. As they begin to ride away,
Jon hears a noise and goes back to discover 
a sixth pup
, an albino with red eyes, that had crawled away from its
mother. Bran finds it curious that it is the only pup that has opened its eyes. Theon claims that the albino will die
quicker than the others, but Jon disagrees, claiming it for himself.

Lady 
Catelyn Tully
 seeks out her husband, Lord 
Eddard Stark
, in the 
godswood
 of 
Winterfell
 to inform him of the
news that his foster father, Lord 
Jon Arryn
, the 
Hand of the King
, is dead and that King 
Robert I Baratheon
, his
family, and half his court are on their way to 
Winterfell
.
Synopsis
Catelyn Stark
 seeks out her husband 
Eddard
 in the 
godswood
 following his return to 
Winterfell
. She knows her
husband always goes there after executing a man. She finds the godswood very dark and unsettling compared to the
sunny one she remembers from her childhood home in 
Riverrun
. Unlike her own 
family
, the Starks keep faith with
the 
old gods
, rather than the 
Faith of the Seven
.
She finds Ned polishing his ancestral greatsword, 
Ice
, under the 
heart tree
 at the center of the grove. He asks after
the children, and Catelyn tells him they are deciding on the names for their new wolves. Ned notes that the 
man
 he
excecuted is the fourth deserter this year. He adds that the man was half mad, that something had put a fear into him
so deep that he could not reach him. The 
Night's Watch
 is dwindling, down to less than a thousand men, not just
from desertions, but from ranging casualties. One day Ned may have to call his banners to fight 
Mance Rayder
himself. Catelyn warns him that there are darker things beyond 
the Wall
. Ned replies that the 
Others
 have been dead
for eight thousand years, and that 
Maester
 
Luwin
 claims they never existed at all. Catelyn replies that nobody had
seen 
direwolves
 until today.
When Ned asks why Catelyn has come, she tells him that 
Jon Arryn
, his foster father and her brother-in-law, is dead.
The news came in King 
Robert
's own hand. When asked, Catelyn explains that Jon Arryn's widow--Catelynn's sister
Lysa Arryn
--and her 
son
 have returned to the 
Eyrie
 and says that she thinks her sister should not be alone and should
have gone back to 
Riverrun
. Ned urges Catelyn to take the children to keep her sister company, but then Catelyn
informs him that 
Robert Baratheon
 has also written to say he is coming to 
Winterfell
. This news gladdens Ned; it
has been nine years since he last saw his old friend. However, Catelyn is worried about the omen of a 
direwolf
 found
dead in the snow with an 
antler
 buried in its throat.
With Robert coming, Catelyn confirms with Ned that they should send word to his brother 
Benjen
 on 
the Wall
. Then
Catelyn informs Ned that Robert's wife 
Cersei Lannister
, their children, and her 
Lannister
 brothers are also coming.
Ned does not like the Lannisters because they came to Robert’s cause only after 
victory
 was certain. Eddard is
looking forward to seeing the children and then announces his worry about feeding them all.

Daenerys II
The exiled Princess 
Daenerys Targaryen
 prepares to be presented to the 
Dothraki
 
khal
, 
Drogo
, as her brother, King
Viserys Targaryen
, hopes to gain a Dothraki 
army
 by making such a 
marriage
 alliance.
Synopsis
For the past half year, the exiled king 
Viserys Targaryen
 and his thirteen year old sister, Princess 
Daenerys
Targaryen
, having been residing in the 
manse
 of 
Illyrio Mopatis
, a 
Magister
 of the 
Free City
 of 
Pentos
. Viserys
wishes to win back 
his father's
 
throne
 and is in need of an army, which he hopes to acquire by making a 
marriage
alliance with a 
Dothraki
 
khal
 who leads a large 
khalasar
.
Viserys presents Daenerys with a gift from Magister Illyrio, a fine silk dress. Daenerys has to look like the princess
she is, so Khal 
Drogo
 will ask for her hand in marriage. Although Daenerys is doubtful of Illyrio's motives, Viserys
insists that the Magister simply wants to earn his good graces. Afraid of angering her brother (which he calls
"waking the 
dragon
"), Daenerys keeps silent about her mistrust. Viserys warns Daenerys not to fail him, and twists
one of her niples to emphasize his threat. According to Viserys, when history of his reign is written, it will be said
that his reign began that night.
Viserys departs, leaving Daenerys alone with her thoughts. She dreads the feast she has to attend that evening, and
her mind wanders to 
Westeros
, the homeland she has never seen. She had been conceived shortly before her mother,
Queen 
Rhaella Targaryen
, fled 
King's Landing
 with Viserys, and born nine months later on 
Dragonstone
. Yet she
knows the stories Viserys has told her, the flight from King's Landing to Dragonstone; Her eldest brother, 
Rhaegar
Targaryen
 
fighting
 
Robert Baratheon
 and dying; The 
Sack of King’s Landing
, the gruesome death of Prince 
Aegon
Targaryen
, and the murder of her father, King 
Aerys II Targaryen
, in the throne room, committed by 
a knight
 of his
own 
Kingsguard
. Nine months after the deaths of her brother and father, Daenerys's mother died giving birth to her
(something for which Viserys has never forgiven her), during a summer storm which destroyed most of the
Targaryen
 fleet which had been Dragonstone's last defense. When the garrison of Dragonstone was wiling to give
Viserys and Daenerys over to 
Stannis Baratheon
, who was 
on his way to take Dragonstone
, Ser 
Willem Darry
 and
four loyal men secretly took them to 
Braavos
. There they lived in a big 
house with a red door
. However, Ser Willem
died, leaving them without a guardian, and the servants stole what money was left. When Viserys and Daenerys
were put out of the house not long afte, they began to travel from city to city, never staying anywhere long, as
Viserys feared the Usurper's assassins. Daenerys recalls how rich merchants, archons and magisters became less and
less willing to host the Targaryens as the years went by, and how Viserys had been forced to sell their mother's
crown. However, despite the lack of support, Viserys has become obsessed with recovering the Iron Throne.
Daenerys knows that he is being called "the Beggar King" behind his back, and wonders if people have given her a
nickname too.
Illyrio's servants come to bathe Daenerys and prepare her for the feast given at the manse of Khal 
Drogo
, where she
is to meet and impress the Khal, so he will ask for her hand in 
marriage
. The servants tell her how lucky she is to
marry a man so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. Once she is properly dressed, her brother returns with
Magister Illyrio and commands her to stand up and turn around. Illyrio showers Daenerys with compliments while
Viserys complains she is too skinny and too young. Illyrio reassures him that she is old enough for the 
khal
 and
comments on her silver-gold hair and purple eyes, the hallmarks of old 
Valyrian
 nobility. When Viserys states that
barbarians are said to have queer tastes such as boys and sheep, Illyrio warns him not to say these things to Khal

Drogo, creating a flare of anger in Viserys’ eyes.
The three of them journey in Illyrio's litter to Khal Drogo's manse in the pitch dark. Viserys states that ten thousand
Dothraki “screamers” will be enough to overthrow 
the usurper
 when combined with those in 
Westeros
 that are
awaiting his return. He speculates on those who would join their cause: 
House Tyrell
, 
House Redwyne
, 
House
Darry
, 
House Greyjoy
, and the 
Dornishmen
. Illyrio assures Viserys that the people in the 
Seven Kingdoms
 secretly
await his return, though Daenerys doubts him.
Illyrio says that Drogo’s mansion was a gift from the magisters of 
Pentos
, to help win Drogo's friendship. They
arrive at the mansion and are announced as King Viserys III and Princess Daenerys. Illyrio points out several
prominent guests, including Ser 
Jorah Mormont
, who had fled the Seven Kingdoms under sentence of death several
years before, and has since spent much time among the Dothraki. Illyrio then points out Khal Drogo himself, who is
as graceful as a panther, and younger than Daenerys had expected. Viserys notes his long braid, which means he has
never been defeated in combat. Daenerys only notes his cold, hard face and is afraid of him. She asks to go home,
provoking a rant from Viserys about how their 
home
 has been taken away from them. Daenerys only meant their
rooms in Illyrio’s estate, but none of the places they have stayed in have been Viserys' home. Viserys also assures
Daenerys that he would let Khal Drogo's whole 
khalasar
, including their horses, rape her if it would win him back
the Seven Kingdoms. He then tells her to stop crying, because Illyrio is leading Khal Drogo over to meet them.
Daenerys stops crying, stands up straight, and smiles.

Eddard II
King 
Robert I Baratheon
 arrives with his party at 
Winterfell
, where he offers Lord 
Eddard Stark
 the position of
Hand of the King
 and proposes a betrothal between Eddard's daughter 
Sansa
 and his own son, crown prince 
Joffrey
.
Synopsis
The king's party, three hundred strong, rides into 
Winterfell
. Eddard recognizes 
Jaime Lannister
, 
Tyrion Lannister
,
Crown Prince 
Joffrey Baratheon
, and 
Sandor Clegane
, but doesn't recognize his old friend King 
Robert
 until Robert
calls out. Eddard is shocked to see that Robert has gained 8 stone (112 lbs) since they last saw each other nine years
ago during the 
Greyjoy Rebellion
. Eddard pays obeisance as Queen 
Cersei
 and the younger children debark from the
wheelhouse. After the formalities of greeting, including the introduction of children from both parties, Robert insists
on being taken down to the crypts where the dead of 
House Stark
 are buried, so he can pay his respects to Eddard's
sister
. Queen Cersei objects, but is disregarded by Robert, and quietly led away by her twin brother.
Ned asks Robert about his journey and Robert complains of the distance that has to be traveled in the vast emptiness
of 
the North
. Robert then describes the advantages of living in the south, telling Ned he has to see the wonders, the
warmth, and the undress of the women.
They descend into the crypt, which is an effort for the out-of-shape Robert. Robert wants to visit the tomb of Ned's
sister 
Lyanna Stark
, who was his betrothed. They pass the dead of House Stark with statues in front of the crypts,
each lord holding a sword on his lap with a 
direwolf
 at his feet. They arrive at the last of the occupied crypts. Here
there are three tombs for Ned’s father 
Lord Rickard
, his elder brother 
Brandon
, and his sister Lyanna. Robert
declares that Ned should have buried Lyanna on a sunny hillside, but Ned explains that she was a Stark of Winterfell
and belongs here as was her wish. Ned remembers her dying, with only he and his friend 
Howland Reed
 nearby,
while Robert recalls taking his vengeance on 
Rhaegar Targaryen
 for what he did to Lyanna, regretting that he only
got to kill him once. Ned suggests that they should return to the surface where Robert's wife will be waiting. Robert
replies that the 
Others
 can take his wife, but they start back all the same.
As they return, Ned asks about 
Jon Arryn
 and Robert declares that he has never seen a man die so quickly: from
healthy to dead within a fortnight. Ned asks how Jon's widow 
Lysa
 is bearing her grief, explaining that 
Catelyn
 fears
for her sister. Robert confides that he thinks Jon’s death has driven Lysa mad and that she has taken 
her son
 back to
the 
Eyrie
. Robert had hoped to foster the sickly boy with 
Tywin Lannister
, but Lysa refused to hear of it and left in
the dead of night; Cersei was furious. Ned, who does not trust Tywin, is relieved. Ned asks to foster Robert Arryn
himself, but Tywin has already agreed and Ned taking him as a ward would be an insult to Tywin.
Ned comments that Robert should visit 
the Wall
, but Robert responds that he has more important concerns such as
replacing Lord Arryn, who held several important positions such as 
Warden of the East
. Ned reminds Robert that
that title traditionally goes with the domain of 
House Arryn
 but Robert declares that he will not appoint six-year-old
Robert Arryn as 
Warden of the East
. Ned reminds Robert that during times of peace the title is only an honor. The
king is not pleased--the son is not the father, though maybe when the boy is grown the title will be given back.
Robert mentions that he also needs a new 
Hand of the King
 and offers the position to Ned so they can work together
again. Then Robert tells Ned how the responsibilities bore him and complains that he is surrounded by flatterers and
fools. He insists that he wants Ned to come south to 
King's Landing
 to be Hand of the King, the second most
important man in the kingdom.

Ned does not want the position and tries to declare himself unworthy of the honor. Robert only jokes that he is not
trying to honor Ned but to get him to run the kingdom for him, relating the low-born saying that “the King eats and
the Hand takes the shit.” Robert asks for at least a smile, but Ned replies that it is said to be so cold in the North that
a man's laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death.
King Robert also offers to marry his son, the Crown Prince Joffrey, to Ned's eleven-year-old daughter 
Sansa Stark
 to
join the Houses of Stark and Baratheon as he and Lyanna were supposed to. Ned hesitates to make this decision,
wishing to speak to his wife, but Robert asks him not to take too long. Ned is filled with a sense of foreboding,
knowing that Winterfell is where he belongs, and that winter is coming.

Jon Snow
 attends the feast Winterfell is holding for the royal guests and speaks with both 
Benjen Stark
 and 
Tyrion
Lannister
.
Synopsis
A feast is held in 
Winterfell
 in honor of King 
Robert
's royal visit. Jon decides he is thankful his bastardy has
relegated him to the far end of the hall with the younger squires instead of the king's family. Here he can drink as
much as he wants (he has a man’s thirst) and mingle freely with those around him.
Jon watches the king and his family as they arrive. He recognizes Queen 
Cersei
's false smile and is disappointed
with fat, red-faced King Robert. The 8-year-old Princess 
Myrcella
 seems smitten with her escort 
Robb
, leading Jon
to decide she is insipid. 
Arya
 is escorted by plump, young Prince 
Tommen
. The 12-year-old Crown Prince 
Joffrey
(who is even taller than Robb) is escorting the radiant 
Sansa
. Jon decides he does not like Joffrey’s pouty lips or the
disdain the prince seems to hold for Winterfell. He also notes that the queen's brother 
Jaime Lannister
 looks like a
proper king, and that waddling dwarf 
Tyrion Lannister
 is grotesquely fascinating, as ugly as Jaime and Cersei are
beautiful. The last to enter are 
Benjen Stark
 and 
Theon Greyjoy
.
Jon feeds his 
direwolf
 
Ghost
 under the table and watches the pup silently face down a full-grown dog three times his
size. Bringing his wolf to the feast is another perk to being the bastard. Jon is soon joined by his uncle Benjen, who
asks Jon how much he's had to drink, adding that Jon is older than he was when he first got truly drunk. Benjen asks
about Ghost and Jon explains that he named him Ghost for his white color and because he never makes a sound.
Benjen then asks why Jon is not at the main table and Jon says flatly that Lady 
Catelyn
 thought seating a bastard
with the king might give offense.
Benjen comments that 
Eddard
 does not seem festive and Jon adds that neither does the queen, probably because of
King Robert's visit to the crypts. Benjen commends Jon's keen observation and remarks that he could use a man like
him on 
the Wall
. Jon asks if he can return to the Wall with Benjen. Benjen replies that the Wall is a hard place for a
boy, but Jon counters that he will turn 15 on his next name day and it's said bastards grow up faster than purebloods.
Jon thinks about how all his half brothers and sisters have futures, but there is no future for a bastard. Benjen says
that he should know a woman and father a bastard or two first, to know what he will be giving up. This angers Jon,
who states that he will 
never
 father a bastard and runs off with Ghost at his heels before anyone can see him cry.
As Jon is leaving, Tyrion Lannister speaks to him from a ledge in the deserted yard and asks if he can take a look at
Ghost. Jon offers to help him down, but Tyrion jumps down, acrobatically landing on his hands and vaulting to his
feet. Ghost is uncertain about Tyrion, but submits to examination at Jon's command. Tyrion asks if Jon is Eddard's
bastard. Jon bridles and Tyrion apologizes that as a dwarf he can usually speak as he pleases, like a jester. He
comments that Jon seems to have more of 
the North
 in him than his half-siblings. Tyrion advises Jon never to forget
who and what he is so that no one can use it against him. When Jon questions what Tyrion would know about being
a bastard, Tyrion replies that all dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes and that, although all dwarfs are bastards,
not all bastards need to be dwarfs.

Catelyn III
A secret letter from 
her sister
 leads 
Catelyn
 to convince 
Ned
 to go to 
King's Landing
 and become the 
Hand of the
King
.
Synopsis
Ned
 and 
Catelyn
 are in Catelyn's bedchamber after making love. Uncomfortable with the warmth of the room, which
is heated by hot springs beneath the castle, Ned opens the windows. As she watches him from the bed, Catelyn
thinks he looks the same as when she married him and hopes they have conceived another child.
The couple discuss King 
Robert
's offer, which Ned intends to refuse. Catelyn insists that he must accept so as not to
offend the king, which might put them all in danger. While Catelyn contemplates the omen of the 
direwolf
 killed by
a 
stag
, Ned wishes his brother 
Brandon
 had lived to be Lord of Winterfell instead.
They are interrupted by a guardsman named 
Desmond
, who says that 
Maester
 
Luwin
 has an urgent message. The
maester is shown in and explains that a carved wooden box containing a fine new glass lens was left in his
observatory while he was napping. The way it was delivered made the maester wonder and he discovered a message
hidden beneath a false bottom. Maester Luwin says he has not read it, and will not give it to Ned because it is
addressed to Catelyn.
Catelyn takes the message apprehensively. It is from her sister 
Lysa
 and written in a secret language only the two
sisters share. Catelyn immediately burns the message after reading it, but explains to Ned that the message claims
Jon Arryn
 was murdered by Queen 
Cersei
 and her 
family
. Catelyn insists that now Ned 
must
 be the 
Hand of the
King
, to find the truth behind Lysa's accusations. Maester Luwin agrees with Catelyn, pointing out that the Hand's
authority will help determine the truth and protect Lysa and 
her son
. Ned reminds them both that 
his father
 went
south once at the summons of a king and never returned. Luwin replies that that was a different time and a different
king. Catelyn insist that if Ned truly loves King Robert like a brother, he will not leave him to face the Lannisters on
his own.
Ned then makes his decision: he will go, but Catelyn must stay behind to govern Winterfell and teach his heir 
Robb
how to be a proper lord. He allows that young 
Rickon
 may stay with her as well, but the others must come south--
Sansa
 to wed 
Joffrey
, and 
Arya
 to learn the ways of a southern court. Catelyn reluctantly agrees, but begs that seven-
year-old 
Bran
 be allowed to stay. Ned insists that Bran must bridge the gap between Robb and Joffrey. The house
will be the safer for it, and Catelyn has to agree. Catelyn feels lonely already.
Maester Luwin asks about 
Jon Snow
 and Catelyn's anger flashes. She remembers the bastard child that Ned brought
back with him in the early days of their marriage. She understood Ned fathering a bastard son, but could not
understand raising a bastard in the castle. There were rumors that 
Ashara Dayne
 was the boy's mother, but Ned
forbade Catelyn to ask about it, insisting that all she needed to know was that Jon was his blood. Ned would never
send Jon away though, and Catelyn could never forgive him that. Catelyn insists that Jon must leave Winterfell, but
Ned argues that there will be no place for Jon at court. Maester Luwin mentions Jon's ambitions to join the 
Night's
Watch
. Ned considers this for a while and finally agrees to let Jon take the black, though not until they are ready to
leave for the south; he wants Jon to enjoy his last few days. Ned decides that when it is time, he will tell Jon himself.

Arya
 runs out on her needlework session to watch the boys practice with swords in the yard.
Synopsis
Arya
 is dismayed at her crooked stitches; she can't match her sister 
Sansa
's needlework. Their governess, 
Septa
Mordane
, coos over Princess 
Myrcella
's needlework, which Arya thinks is also crooked. Sansa is whispering with
Jeyne Poole
 and 
Beth Cassel
. When Arya asks what they are whispering about she is told it is about how handsome
Prince Joffrey is, and that he has complimented Sansa and is going to marry her. Arya points out that 
Jon Snow
thinks Joffrey looks like a girl. Sansa laments that Jon gets jealous because he is a 
bastard
 but Arya defends him,
drawing the septa's attention to her.
Septa Mordane inspects Arya's stitches and pronounces her dissatisfaction. Humiliated, Arya bolts for the door,
stopping only long enough to be forced to bow to Princess Myrcella. Arya wishes she had some of her sister's skill
and beauty. She has her father’s looks, not the beauty of their mother like Sansa. Jeyne used to call her "Horseface",
which was all the more hurtful because the only thing that Arya could do better than Sansa was ride. That and
manage a household since Sansa has no head for figures.
Arya finds her direwolf pup 
Nymeria
 waiting for her and together they go to watch the boys sparring in the practice
yard, not daring to go back to her room where she would be found and punished. On the covered bridge overlooking
the yard, Arya comes across Jon Snow seated on a sill with 
Ghost
, watching the fighting below. She sits down
beside him and they watch together.
In the yard below, heavily-padded 
Bran
 and Prince 
Tommen
 are fighting each other with wooden swords under the
watchful eye of Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, the master-at-arms. The group of spectators includes 
Robb
 and 
Theon
. Jon
comments that swords are a bit more exhausting than needlework, but Arya responds that they are also more fun.
Arya remembers thinking when she was little that she was a bastard like Jon because they were the only children to
take after their father. When Arya asks why Jon is not down in the yard with the others, Jon explains that bastards
are not allowed to damage princes, only trueborn swords can do that. Arya says she could fight as well as Bran who
is only seven while she is nine, but Jon says she doesn't have enough strength for a longsword.
Jon points out that the newly-arrived Prince 
Joffery
 is wearing a sigil that has both the stag and lion on it, giving his
mother
’s 
Lannister
 sigil equality to the royal 
Baratheon
 sigil. Jon suggests that Arya should wear a combination sigil
for the 
Starks
 and 
Tullys
, but Arya jokes that a wolf with a trout in its mouth would look silly. She questions why a
girl would need a sigil if she isn't allowed to fight. Jon shrugs that girls get the sigils but not the swords, while
bastards get the swords but not the sigils.
Below, Bran has knocked Tommen down and Ser Rodrik calls Robb and Joffrey for a bout. Joffrey acts as if it is
beneath his dignity to fight Starks with practice swords. He suggests real swords and Robb readily accepts. Jon
comments to Arya that Joffrey truly is a "little shit". Ser Rodrik states that he will only allow blunted tourney
swords. Joffrey's scarred bodyguard 
Sandor Clegane
 remarks that he killed a man with a real sword when he was
only twelve. Joffrey makes a few more condescending remarks that enrage Robb, then feigns a yawn and leaves
with Tommen. Jon encourages Arya to go to her room and face her punishment. Arya insists it is not fair, but Jon
says that nothing is fair as he walks away with Ghost. Arya returns to her room to find not only Septa Mordane, but
also her mother.

Bran
 is climbing the towers of 
Winterfell
 when he discovers 
Cersei
 and 
Jaime
 
Lannister
 making love and talking
about the danger 
his father
 poses. Eventually, he is discovered and Jaime shoves him out the window.
Synopsis
The majority of the men have gone hunting boar with the 
king
, leaving Bran behind with 
Jon
, 
Rickon
, and the girls.
Jon seems to be angry with everyone, even though he’s going to 
the Wall
 with 
Uncle Benjen
, so Bran does not look
very hard for him.
At first Bran was excited about leaving 
Winterfell
 and going to 
King's Landing
 on a real horse, not just a pony. He
remembers the stories 
Old Nan
 told about ghosts, terrible dungeons, and dragon skulls on the walls. He dreams of
being a member of the 
Kingsguard
 someday and is anxious to meet the greatest living knight, Ser 
Barristan the Bold
.
But now Bran is also apprehensive about leaving the only home he has ever known. He will miss all those he is
leaving behind, even his pony.
Not being able to stand the goodbyes, Bran goes to the castle 
godswood
 with his 
direwolf
. Unlike all his siblings, he
still hasn’t named his wolf; none of the names he tries seem right. Eventually, Bran gets tired of trying to teach his
wolf to fetch and decides to go climbing. His wolf doesn’t want him to go and howls when he climbs away up a tree
and onto the armory roof.
Bran spends much of his time climbing the roofs of Winterfell. His 
mother
 claims that he could climb before he
could walk. Since Bran cannot remember learning to climb or learning to walk he assumes it must be true. His
mother is also terrified that one day he might fall and kill himself. Once Bran kept a promise not to climb for almost
a fortnight and was miserable the entire time. Finally he gave in, but confessed his crime the next day. When his
father
 ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself, they found him sleeping in the tallest tree in the grove the
next morning. His father, angry and laughing, told him that from now on he was free to climb, so long as his mother
didn’t catch him.
Others have tried to stop him, but to no avail. The guards tried to stop him, but they were too slow and escaping
from them was fun. Old Nan once told a story of a boy who climbed too high and was struck by lightning and had
his eyes eaten by crows, but Bran likes to feed the crows and they never seem interested in eating his eyes. 
Maester
Luwin
 made a clay boy and threw it off the wall as an example, but Bran only responded that he is not made of clay
and he never falls.
Bran is climbing toward the Broken Tower, where he likes to feed the crows, when he is startled by voices from the
First Keep, the oldest part of the castle. At first he doesn’t recognize them as Queen 
Cersei
 and her brother, Ser
Jaime
. Cersei is telling Jaime that he should be the 
Hand of the King
 and that Eddard Stark will put them in danger
because the king loves him like a brother. Jaime jokes that Robert hates his brothers. Unamused, Cersei insists that
Robert will listen to Eddard. Jaime states that he prefers honorable men to ambitious men like Robert’s brothers and
Littlefinger
.
Cersei says she is worried about what 
Lysa Arryn
 may have said to the Starks, but Jaime tells her not to worry, as

Lysa has no proof. Despite this, Cersei remains fearful that Eddard might betray her son 
Joffrey
 when he takes the
throne or convince Robert to put her aside.
Bran grows frightened by what he overhears but wants to see who is talking, so he climbs over the window, then
drops down. He can see the man and woman inside, naked and wrestling, fondling, and moaning. He recognizes
Cersei just as her eyes open and she sees him. Bran loses his grip as he tries to escape, but he catches himself on the
window ledge. Cersei and Jaime come to look at him. Jaime extends a hand to Bran and pulls him up onto the ledge.
As Bran begins to relax, Jaime asks him how old he is. Bran tells him he is seven. Then Jaime loathingly says, “The
things I do for love,” and shoves Bran backwards out the window into the empty air.

Tyrion
 meets up with his nephew 
Joffrey
 and insists he pay his sympathies to the Starks, before joining his 
brother
and 
sister
 for breakfast with news that 
Bran Stark
 will probably survive.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 has been reading all night in Winterfell's library when he hears a wolf howl. He gives up on reading, noticing
that it's near dawn and that Septon 
Chayle
 is asleep. Tyrion wakes him and goes out to break his fast. As he leaves,
Tyrion hears 
Sandor Clegane
 complaining about how long 
Bran Stark
 is taking to die. 
Prince Joffrey
 states that at
least Bran is dying quietly, but the wolf's howling is disturbing his sleep. The Hound offers to go kill it, which
Joffrey finds amusing, believing the 
Starks
 would not notice it missing. Tyrion notes that the Starks can count past
six, unlike some princes.
The Hound uses the remark as an excuse to make fun of Tyrion's height. Tyrion brushes the comment off before
advising Joffrey to pay a visit to the Starks to offer his sympathies. When Joffrey asks what good it would do,
Tyrion tells him that his absence has been noticed. Joffrey continues to refuse, but Tyrion proceeds to browbeat him
to the edge of tears until the boy acquiesces. The Hound, looming over Tyrion, warns him that the prince will
remember how his uncle slapped him. Tyrion responds that he hopes he does and that the Hound should be a good
dog and remind Joffrey if he forgets it.
Tyrion then seeks out his 
brother
 and 
sister
, who are having breakfast in the morning room of the guest house. He
asks if 
King Robert
 is still in bed and Cersei disdainfully explains that Robert has been up all night with Lord
Eddard
 and has taken the Starks' sorrow deeply to heart. When Jaime adds that Robert has a big heart, Tyrion
remembers that during his childhood Jaime was the only person who ever showed him any affection or respect. In
return, Tyrion is willing to forgive Jaime almost anything.
As Tyrion orders breakfast, 
Prince Tommen
 asks after Bran and says he doesn't want him to die. Jaime comments on
the name "Brandon" being 
unlucky
, but Tyrion states this may not be the case, explaining that 
Maester Luwin
 thinks
that Bran may recover. As he speaks, Tyrion catches the significant glance between Jaime and Cersei. Cersei
immediately insists it is no mercy for Bran to live. When 
Myrcella
 asks if Bran will be alright, Tyrion replies that
Bran will never walk again. Tyrion goes on to say that the 
wolf
 howling outside his window may be contributing to
Bran's survival: when the window is closed Bran gets weaker, but his heart strengthens again when it is open. Cersei
responds that the wolves disturb her and are dangerous, but Jaime tells her the girls' wolves will doubtless follow
them to 
King's Landing
.
Tyrion then reveals to his family that he intends to visit 
the Wall
 before returning south. Jaime jokes that he hopes
Tyrion is not planning to 
take the black
, but Tyrion quips back that if he did the whores would go begging. Cersei
leaves abruptly with her children, insisting they shouldn't hear such filth, while Jaime wonders if Eddard will leave
Winterfell
 with Bran so ill. Tyrion insists that King Robert will make the choice for Eddard.
Jaime declares that if he were Eddard, he would end Bran's torment and save him from being a cripple. Tyrion,
himself less than able-bodied, advises Jaime not to say as much to Eddard before wondering out loud what tale Bran
might tell if he wakes up. Jaime is not amused and wonders aloud about Tyrion's loyalty. Tyrion replies that Jaime
knows how much he loves his family.

Jon
 says his last goodbyes, first to the comatose 
Bran
, then to 
Robb
, and finally to 
Arya
, to whom he gives a
Braavosi
-type 
sword
.
Synopsis
Jon
 climbs the stairs to 
Bran
's room with 
Ghost
 beside him, fearing that it might be the last time. 
Catelyn
 is there,
having never left Bran's side for close to a fortnight, which has kept Jon away, but now there is no more time. When
Jon enters, Catelyn responds with hostility, asking why he is here and demanding he leave. While once this would
have sent him crying, now it only makes Jon angry so that when Catelyn threatens to call the guards, he calls her
bluff.
Jon finds Bran emaciated and shrunken, and the covers over his legs look wrong. Jon asks Bran not to die and tells
him everyone is waiting for him to wake up. Jon remembers how much Bran was looking forward to the journey
south while explaining that he is going north to 
the Wall
 with Uncle 
Benjen
. Catelyn admits that she was wishing for
Bran to stay home with her, and her wish seems to have been granted. When Jon attempts to reassure her, she lashes
out at him and, as he is leaving, tells him that it should have been him that fell.
Jon makes the long walk to the yard, where things are in an uproar as the party prepares to leave. 
Robb
 brings news
that Benjen is looking for Jon. When Robb asks about his mother, Jon tells him she was kind. Robb then remarks
that next time they meet, Jon will be all in black, and they hug farewell.
Next, Jon goes to see 
Arya
, who is repacking her things with help from 
Nymeria
, not having folded them well
enough for 
Septa
 
Mordane
 the first time. Jon says he has a secret present for her. After Arya closes the door and sets
Nymeria to guard it, Jon gives her a small sword made specially for her, one like the swords from 
Braavos
. He
explains to her that she will have to practise every day, shows her how to hold it, and then gives her her first lesson:
stick them with the pointy end. He then warns her not to tell 
Sansa
. Arya runs to him for a last hug. Just before he
leaves, Jon tells Arya that all the best swords have a name. When she asks what her sword's name is he explains that
it’s her very favorite thing. Then say the name together: "
Needle
".

Daenerys III
Daenerys Targaryen
 is married to 
Khal
 
Drogo
 in a ceremony that lasts all day with a dozen deaths. When night falls,
Drogo takes Daenerys for a long ride before making love.
Synopsis
While waiting for 
Daenerys
' wedding, 
Illyrio Mopatis
 explains that 
Drogo
's 
khalasar
 of 40,000 
Dothraki
 warriors
and their families and herds gathered outside the walls of 
Pentos
 have made the other 
magisters
 so uneasy that they
have doubled the city guard. The Dothraki are eating everything in sight, and Illyrio thinks it would be best to have
the marriage as soon as possible. Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 has offered and been accepted into the service of Daenerys'
brother 
Viserys
. Viserys is impatient for 
Drogo
 to help him regain his throne. Illyrio explains to him that the 
Khal
must take his new bride to 
Vaes Dothrak
 first, and then wait until the omens are favorable for war. Viserys
complains at the delay despite Illyrio and Jorah cautioning patience.
That night, Daenerys dreams of Viserys chasing and beating her and saying, "You woke the dragon." Then she turns
to see a dragon in his place and wakes shaking with a fine sheen of sweat on her skin.
Daenerys weds Khal Drogo under the open sky, before forty thousand Dothraki warriors. The ceremonies begin at
dawn and continue until dusk. Viserys, Illyrio, and Jorah are seated below Drogo and Daenerys at the feast, which
grates on Viserys' pride, especially when food is first served to Daenerys and Drogo before being offered to him.
Daenerys, with the forced smile her brother told her she should wear, eats little since her stomach is upset. She is
seated only with her new husband, and they do not even share a common language, so there is nothing for her to do.
Early on in the day she sees Dothraki men taking dancing women and mounting them in the open like animals.
When two men grab the same woman, a fight to the death ensues. The survivor then takes another woman. Illyrio
has told her that a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered dull; by the end of the day a dozen
men have died, obviously making it an exceptional wedding. Daenerys is consumed by fear of her hulking husband
with a stern cruel face and a culture that is so different, and of her brother if she should fail him.
As the sun sets, Daenerys receives her bride gifts. Viserys gives her three hand maids that cost him nothing, picked
to teach her what she needs to know: 
Irri
 (to teach her how to ride), 
Jhiqui
 (to teach her the Dothraki tongue) and
Doreah
 (to teach her the arts of love). Ser Jorah, with an apology since it was all he could afford, gives her a stack of
old books in the 
Common Tongue
, and she thanks him with all her heart. Illyrio gives her fine silks and fabrics, and
three huge 
dragon
's eggs: one is green, one is cream-colored, and one is black with scarlet ripples and swirls. Illyrio
tells her that they have turned to stone over the years. Khal Drogo's 
bloodriders
 give her the traditional three
weapons, which she refuses with the traditional refusals and passes to her husband. Many other gifts come from the
other Dothraki.
Last of all Drogo brings forward his own bride gift, a fine grey 
filly
. Drogo easily lifts her by the waist up to the
saddle. She does not know what to do. Ser Jorah tells her to take the reins and ride. She is only a fair rider, having
traveled almost exclusively by other means, but as she rides, she forgets her fears and eventually sends the horse into
a gallop, and even has it leap over a firepit. She returns and tells Illyrio to tell her husband that he has given her the
wind, and Drogo smiles. Then the sun sets and Drogo readies his horse. When Viserys warns her to please her

husband, lest she will regret it, fear comes back to her.
Drogo sets a fast pace, saying nothing. Daenerys tries to rid herself of her fear by remembering she is the blood of
the dragon and the dragon is never afraid. It is full dark when they stop at a grassy place beside a small stream.
Drogo swings off his horse and lifts her down from hers. She feels fragile in her wedding silks. She begins to weep,
but Drogo says "No," and wipes her tears away. She asks questions but all Drogo says is “No.” He starts softly
murmuring to her in Dothraki to soothe her. Drogo sets her down on a rock and sits facing her, then starts removing
the bells from his hair, and Daenerys helps. Then he indicates that she should unbraid his hair, which takes a long
time. Then Drogo undresses her, with tenderness, and caresses her until she is ready for him. When he bares her
breasts, she covers herself with her hands but Drogo gently pulls her hands away. After he finishes undressing her,
he watches her for a while. Then he begins to touch her face and hair. It seems like hours to Daenerys before his
hands go to her breasts. This makes Daenerys breathless, and when he seats her on his lap and asks “No?” she
moves his hand inside her and says “Yes.”

Ned
 and King 
Robert
 discuss the threat posed by 
Daenerys Targaryen
's marriage and the events surrounding the
Sack of King's Landing
.
Synopsis
Ned
 is woken before dawn to find his horse saddled and King 
Robert
 waiting. When the king claims to have urgent
matters of state to discuss, Ned invites him to come inside. Robert refuses, claiming that the camp is full of ears, so
Ned dresses and mounts up.
Robert sets a hard pace and soon the pair leave the 
kingsroad
 to ride through the 
barrowlands
. They do not stop until
dawn, miles south of the main party. Exhilarated by the ride, Robert complains of the glacial pace of 
Cersei
’s
wheelhouse and jokingly suggests that he and Ned run off to live as vagabond knights. Ned laughs and reminds
Robert of their duties and that they are no longer the boys they once were. Robert jokes that Ned never was the boy
he once was, then tries to recall the name of the woman Ned fathered 
Jon Snow
 with. Ned provides the name 
Wylla
,
but coldly refuses to say more about her.
Robert finally gets to the business at hand: a message from the eunuch 
Varys
, his master of whisperers in 
King's
Landing
. Ned reads the message with some trepidation, thinking of 
Lysa Arryn
 and her terrible accusation, but finds
that it concerns the 
wedding
 of 
Daenerys Targaryen
 to 
Khal
 
Drogo
. When Robert explains that the information has
come from Ser 
Jorah Mormont
, Ned takes offense, recalling Mormont as a fugitive who fled the King’s justice after
selling some poachers to a 
Tyroshi
 slaver in defiance of the law.
The news of the wedding does not worry Ned, but when Robert angrily suggests an assassination attempt he is not
surprised. Since the days of the 
rebellion
, Robert has held a hatred for the 
Targaryens
 that seems a madness to Ned.
Ned recalls the angry words that passed between Robert and himself when 
Tywin Lannister
 presented Robert with
the corpses of 
Rhaegar Targaryen
’s wife 
Elia
 and children 
Aegon
 and 
Rhaenys
 as tokens of fealty. Ned called it
murder but Robert called it war. It took the death of 
Lyanna
 to reconcile them again.
This time Ned keeps his temper, telling Robert that he is no Tywin Lannister to slaughter innocents. Robert angrily
insists that Daenerys will not remain an innocent forever and will soon breed more “dragonspawn” to plague him.
When Ned reiterates that killing a child would be unspeakable, Robert responds that what 
Aerys
 did to Ned’s 
father
and 
brother
 and what Rhaegar did to Lyanna were unspeakable.
When Robert mentions that Drogo has 100,000 men in his 
horde
, Ned insists that even a million 
Dothraki
 are no
threat to the realm without ships. Robert replies that ships can be found in the 
Free Cities
 and that many in the 
Seven
Kingdoms
—particularly in 
Dorne
 and 
the Reach
—would not hesitate to join a Targaryen invasion. Despite this, Ned
remains convinced that they would be able to drive the Dothraki back, emphasizing the importance of appointing a
new 
Warden of the East
. When Robert refuses to appoint 
Jon Arryn
’s son 
Robert
, Ned suggests the king’s own
brother, 
Stannis
. When Robert continues to be evasive, Ned quickly deduces that he has already promised the office
to 
Jaime Lannister
. Ned reminds Robert that Jaime already stands to succeed Tywin Lannister as 
Warden of the
West
 and that as Warden of both East and West, Jaime would control half of all the realm’s armies.

Ned asks whether Jaime can be trusted. When Robert asks why he shouldn’t trust Jaime, Ned reminds him that
Jaime betrayed and killed the last king he was sworn to protect. To illustrate his point about Jaime Lannister, Ned
describes to Robert how, after the 
Battle of the Trident
, he followed Rhaegar's army back to King's Landing to find
the city 
sacked
 by the Lannisters. Ned goes on to explain that upon entering the throne room, he found King Aerys
dead on the floor and Jaime sitting on the 
Iron Throne
. Although Jaime eventually rose to say that he was only
keeping the uncomfortable thing warm for Robert, Ned insists that Jaime had no right to sit the throne.
Robert finds this amusing and does not consider Jaime's "great sin" to be that bad. He gallops off but Ned pauses,
despairing of ever keeping Robert from making mistakes. He still believes he should be in Winterfell with his wife
and 
Bran
. Finally, resigned to not being able to be where he belongs, Ned follows his king.

As they travel north 
Tyrion
 and 
Jon Snow
 argue about the realities of life on the 
Wall
.
Synopsis
After a fortnight riding north from 
Winterfell
 with 
Benjen Stark
, 
Jon Snow
, and two of his own retainers, 
Tyrion
 is
amazed by the enormous size of 
the North
. Although he knows the maps of the region as well as anyone, the land
itself is quite another thing. It has grown colder, quieter, and far lonelier the farther north they go and the Kingsroad
has narrowed to a wild track.
Three days out of Winterfell the farmland has given way to the dense, dark forests of the 
Wolfswood
. There they
meet up with 
Yoren
, a brother of the 
Night's Watch
, accompanied by two peasant boys condemned to join the
Watch. That night Tyrion notices Jon Snow looking at their new companions with dismay and feels sorry for the boy
who has had such a hard life chosen for him. Tyrion feels less sympathy for Benjen Stark, who apparently shares his
brother
’s distaste for Lannisters and seems intent on making Tyrion’s journey north as uncomfortable as possible.
However, Tyrion does take a small bit of revenge when he accepts a tattered old bearskin cloak from Benjen, a gift
Tyrion thinks Benjen did not expect him to accept and is probably regretting.
By the eighteenth night of their journey the inns and settlements have long since disappeared, forcing the party to
make camp. Being too small to help, Tyrion (as is his custom) goes away from the camp with a book about 
dragons
,
one of several brought with him from Winterfell. Tyrion has always been interested in dragons. He remembers
seeking out the dragon skulls in 
King's Landing
 the first time he was there. He recalls having a torch with him when
he discovered the skulls and having the sensation that they seemed to like it when he put his torch to them. There
were three skulls much larger than the others and one of the skulls could have swallowed a mammoth whole. Tyrion
recalls that King 
Loren I
, an ancestor of the 
Lannisters
, had been about to defeat 
Aegon I Targaryen
 in battle when
the Targaryens 
unleashed
 all three of their dragons and made short work of their opponents.
As Tyrion reads he is approached by Jon Snow, who asks why he reads so much. Tyrion explains that because his
body is twisted and weak he must rely on his mind and that a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.
When Jon asks what Tyrion is reading, Tyrion begins to explain about dragons and how he fantasized about them as
a child when feeling resentful toward his family.
When Tyrion goes so far as to suggest that Jon must feel resentment towards his own family, Jon protests. However
Tyrion continues to push the issue, sarcastically describing how Lady 
Catelyn
 treats him as one of her own, how
Robb
 is kind because he is the heir, and how Eddard Stark must have had a good reason to pack Jon off to the 
Wall
.
When Jon replies that the Night’s Watch is a noble calling, Tyrion describes the Watch as a midden heap for the
realm’s debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards, all kept busy watching for imaginary 
grumkins
 and 
snarks
.
When Jon asks him to stop, Tyrion realizes what he has been saying and feels badly. Reaching out to comfort Jon,
he is attacked and knocked down by Jon’s 
direwolf
, 
Ghost
. Unable to get up on his own, Tyrion is forced to
apologize to Jon before receiving help. When Tyrion questions why the wolf attacked, Jon jokes that Ghost must
have mistaken Tyrion for a grumkin, which amuses them both.

Having calmed down, Jon asks Tyrion if the things he said of the Night’s Watch were true. When Tyrion says yes,
Jon accepts the truth grimly. The two share some wine and return to camp for a supper of squirrel stew. Tyrion is the
last to retire, and Jon has the first watch.

Catelyn
's breakdown over 
Bran's
 fall ends when an attempt is made on Bran's life. Catelyn delays 
the assassin
 long
enough for Bran's 
direwolf
 to arrive and kill the assassin. Catelyn is now convinced Bran did not fall, but was
pushed.
Synopsis
Eight days after 
Eddard
 and the others have left 
Winterfell
, 
Catelyn
 is still sitting at 
Bran's
 bedside in her fragile
mental state. 
Maester
 
Luwin
 comes to tell her how much 
the king's
 visit has cost them, but Catelyn is not interested
in looking at figures. Regardless, the maester continues to speak of replacing provisions. Catelyn insists that the
steward can worry about such matters. Luwin reminds her that 
Vayon Poole
 went south with Lord Eddard and needs
to be replaced, along with a number of other positions. Catelyn is outraged that he can think of such trivial things
when Bran is dying until 
Robb
 arrives to take charge of the appointments.
After the maester leaves, Robb asks Catelyn what she thinks she's doing spending all her time with Bran and not
even saying farewell to her own family. Catelyn insists she can't bear to be away from Bran, in case he should die.
Robb assures her that Bran is not going to die and reminds her that her other children need her, too. He goes on to
explain that 
Rickon
 just follows him around all day crying, thinking everyone has abandoned him.
Robb hears a 
direwolf
 howling outside and opens the window, explaining that the sound seems to be good for Bran.
When the other direwolves join in, Catelyn screams for Robb to make the noise stop and then collapses to the floor.
Robb helps her up but she only begins screaming again. Then Robb notices the dogs barking as well and sees the
library tower afire.
While Robb rushes off to fight the fire, Catelyn remains behind with Bran. When she turns away from the window,
however, she is face-to-face with 
a filthy man
 brandishing 
a knife
. The man claims that Catelyn was not supposed to
be there and moves towards Bran, claiming that killing him would be a mercy. Catelyn attempts to scream for help,
but the man is too quick as he moves to slit her throat. Catelyn manages to grab the blade with her hands and push it
away, cutting her fingers badly. She bites the man's hand and fights her way free. The man is about to attack her
again when Bran's direwolf leaps onto him and rips out his throat. Once the man is dead, the direwolf settles down
on Bran's bed.
Catelyn is taken back to her chambers. 
Old Nan
 undresses her and helps her into a bath. After the bath, Maester
Luwin dresses Catelyn's wounds: her fingers are cut almost to the bone and the man had pulled out a handful of hair.
The maester gives her milk of the poppy, which puts her to sleep. She wakes up four days later. It seems like a
nightmare, but the pain in her hands reminds her that it was real. When Catelyn remembers her behavior since Bran's
fall she is ashamed, promising herself that it will not happen again.
Robb, now wearing armor and a sword, comes to see her with 
Theon Greyjoy
, Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, and 
Hallis Mollen
,
the new 
captain of the guard
. Hal tells her that nobody knows who the man was, but he had likely been lurking in the
stables since the king's visit. Where the man had been hiding they found ninety 
silver stags
 hidden under the straw.
When Robb asks why anybody would want to kill Bran, Catelyn insists that as a 
lord
 he must learn to answer his
own questions. Robb guesses that somebody is afraid of what Bran might do or say if he wakes up and so posts a

heavy guard on Bran.
Rodrik points out that the dagger used by the assassin, a 
Valyrian steel
 blade with a 
dragonbone
 handle, is a much
finer weapon than anything the low-born footpad should have possessed; someone must have given it to him.
Catelyn then tells Rodrik, Theon, and Robb in strict confidence of her sister 
Lysa's
 suspicions about the death of 
Jon
Arryn
. She reminds them that 
Jaime Lannister
 did not go hunting with the others the day Bran fell, and that she does
not believe that Bran fell, but that he was pushed. The group admits that this is a reasonable conclusion.
However, Maester Luwin points out that all they have is conjecture, and that they must have proof or else keep
silent. After some deliberation, Catelyn decides that she and Rodrik will go to 
King's Landing
 by ship to inform
Eddard, hopefully arriving ahead of the king’s party.

Sansa II
After exploring the camp, 
Sansa Stark
 goes riding with her betrothed, Prince 
Joffrey
. Near the 
ruby ford
, they come
upon 
Arya Stark
 and a 
butcher's boy
 play-fighting. Joffrey begins to torment the boy until Arya attacks him.
Synopsis
Sansa
 is having breakfast with 
Septa
 
Mordane
 in an 
inn
 near the 
Trident
. When Sansa feeds her 
direwolf
 
Lady
 under
the table, the septa says that although Sansa is a good girl she is as willful as her sister Arya when it comes to her
direwolf.
The septa informs Sansa that they have been invited to ride in the wheelhouse with Queen 
Cersei
 and Princess
Myrcella
. Sansa has been looking forward to this for a week, hoping for a chance to be with Prince 
Joffrey
. Joffrey
is everything she ever wanted her prince to be like: tall and strong and handsome. The one thing Sansa is afraid of is
that Arya will ruin everything for her. Septa Mordane wants Sansa and Arya to dress well for the event and Sansa
has already decided on a fine silk dress. She does not expect Arya to wear anything appropriate. Sansa begs to be
excused so she can look for Arya.
She finds Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to comb the mud out of her direwolf 
Nymeria
's fur. Arya is not
interested in riding in the wheelhouse, and intends to go riding with 
Mycah
 to look for 
rubies
 in the river. Sansa
insists that there is no fun in riding because there is nothing to see, but Arya is fascinated by all the new flowers and
landmarks and people they are seeing along the way. Sansa informs Arya that she has to come, asking why anyone
would want to ride a stinky horse when they could ride in the wheelhouse on pillows while eating lemon cakes and
keeping company with the queen. Arya replies that she does not even like the queen and still intends to go riding.
Sansa, giving up, leaves but Arya yells after her that Lady will not be allowed in the wheelhouse, which leaves
Sansa speechless.
When she nears the camp, Sansa sees a crowd gathered around the wheelhouse; the 
council
 has sent an honor guard
from 
King's Landing
 to accompany them the rest of the way. The party includes two knights in fine armour: a strong
old man in white armor and a beautiful young man in green armor. There is also a gaunt, grim man that Sansa finds
so terrifying that she backs right into 
Sandor Clegane
. Sansa kneels and hugs Lady and, next thing she knows, the
two new arrivals are standing above her. Joffrey explains that the terrifying man is Ser 
Ilyn Payne
, the King's Justice
(the royal executioner).
The white knight then introduces himself as Ser 
Barristan Selmy
, Lord Commander of the 
Kingsguard
, but the green
knight insists that she guess. Based on his age and his antlered helm, Sansa correctly deduces him to be the king's
youngest brother, Lord 
Renly Baratheon
. Feeling more comfortable, Sansa apologizes to Ser Ilyn Payne, but the
man does not speak. Once he has left, Joffrey explains that his tongue was ripped out by 
Mad King Aerys
.
The Queen says that she must speak with the councilors, and therefore must postpone the day with Myrcella.
Instead, she asks Joffrey to entertain their guests—Sansa is overjoyed with the idea of a whole day with Joffrey.
Sansa offers to do whatever the prince wants, and when Joffrey suggest they go riding, Sansa gushes that she loves
riding. Joffrey then suggests that it would be best to leave Lady and his dog, Sandor Clegane, behind. When Sansa
questions leaving Clegane behind Joffrey brandishes his sword, 
Lion's Tooth
.
They ride along the river, exploring the countryside until they draw near to the 
battlefield
 where King 
Robert

defeated 
Rhaegar Targaryen
. Then they hear an odd sound, like wooden clattering, coming from nearby. In a nearby
clearing, they find a boy and a girl play-fighting with sticks. The boy, taller and older than the girl, is winning.
When the girl is disarmed by a smack on the hand, Sansa recognizes her as Arya. Joffrey laughs and the boy, a
butcher's boy named 
Mycah
, drops his stick. Joffrey begins to taunt Mycah and challenges him to a fight, sword
against stick. Mycah insists that Arya asked him to fight her, which Sansa quickly realizes is the truth. Joffrey
remains oblivious however, and goes so far as to prick the boy's cheek with his sword. Arya picks up her stick and
tells Joffrey to leave Mycah alone. Joffrey insists that he will not hurt Mycah, much.
Without warning, Arya breaks her stick over the back of Joffrey's head. Mycah runs away while an enraged Joffrey
staggers but manages to catch a second blow from Arya on his sword, knocking the splintered stick from her hand.
Ignoring Sansa's screams for them to stop, Arya throws a rock and hits Joffrey's horse, driving it away. Joffrey
chases Arya with his sword until she is backed up against a tree. Suddenly Nymeria appears, savaging Joffrey's
sword arm and forcing him to drop his sword. Arya calls Nymeria off and picks up Lion's Tooth while Joffrey lies
whimpering on the ground. The prince pleads to Arya not to hurt him. Arya throws the sword into the river before
running off with Nymeria.
Once Arya is gone, Sansa goes to help Joffrey tenderly, but he snarls at her to leave and not touch him and Sansa
can see the contempt in his eyes.

 tell King

 very different stories concerning their 
fight
 near the 
Trident
. When 
Sansa
 claims
she does not remember, Queen 
Cersei
 demands the death of a 
direwolf
. With 
Nymeria
 gone, 
Lady
 is sentenced to
death instead.
Synopsis
After four days of searching, 
Vayon Poole
 comes to 
Ned
 with news that 
Arya
 has been found unharmed. Ned is
relieved that it was 
Jory Cassel
 who found her rather than Queen 
Cersei
’s men. Unfortunately, the 
Lannister
 guards
at the gate informed the queen, who had Arya brought directly before King 
Robert
.
Ned rushes to the audience chamber of nearby 
Castle Darry
, which has been hosting the king’s party during the
search. He is dismayed to find the chamber full of people, preventing a private and amicable solution. Ned also
notes that very few in the crowd are likely to be sympathetic to the Starks; most are either Lannister men or loyal to
the local lord 
Raymun Darry
, a prominent 
Targaryen
 loyalist who lost family and fortune at the 
Trident
. However,
Ned is relieved that neither 
Jaime Lannister
 nor 
Sandor Clegane
 are present.
Arya apologizes to Ned profusely as she cries. Ned turns angrily to the king, demanding to know why Arya was not
brought to him first. Queen Cersei bristles at his tone but Robert apologizes, explaining that he only wanted to finish
the business quickly. Cersei then accuses Arya and 
Mycah
 of ambushing Joffrey with clubs while setting 
Nymeria
 to
tear off his arm. When Joffrey affirms this, Arya calls him a liar. After the king has listened to Arya’s side of the
story, Lord 
Renly
 begins snickering and asks Joffrey how a skinny nine-year-old girl managed to disarm him with a
broom handle. When Joffrey recounts a very different story, King Robert is exasperated.
Ned reminds the king that 
Sansa
 was also present and has Sansa brought in to testify. However, Sansa—torn
between her family and her love for Joffrey—claims she doesn’t remember. This infuriates Arya, who lunges at
Sansa. Cersei uses this as an example of how wild Arya is, and insists she wants Arya punished. King Robert, even
more exasperated, orders Ned to discipline Arya while he will discipline Joffrey. Unsatisfied, Cersei demands that
Nymeria be killed and offers 100 gold dragons for her pelt. However, since Nymeria has disappeared, Cersei
demands the skin of the other direwolf. When Ned protests, Robert only responds that a direwolf is not a pet and that
the girl would be happier with a dog.
Sansa finally realizes that they are talking about 
her
 
direwolf
 and goes crying to Ned. In a final attempt to save the
direwolf, Ned insists that the king execute the wolf himself but Robert only walks away. Ned refuses to let 
Ilyn
Payne
 do the task. When Cersei voices suspicion about Ned’s intentions, Ned replies that the direwolf is from 
the
North
 and deserves better than a butcher.
With Sansa’s cries in his ears, Ned goes to Lady. As he sits beside the wolf waiting for his 
sword
, Ned considers the
names his children chose for their wolves and finds that Sansa chose a good name for her well-behaved wolf. After
the deed is done, Ned commands four guardsmen to return Lady’s body to 
Winterfell
 for burial, insisting that Cersei
will never have her skin.
As he is returning, Sandor Clegane and his riders come back from the hunt. Clegane states that while they didn’t

find Arya they did find her pet and drops a corpse at Ned’s feet. As he bends to uncover the corpse, Ned wonders
how he will tell Arya. However, rather than Nymeria, the body turns out to be Arya’s friend Mycah, cut down from
horseback. When Ned states that Clegane ran the boy down, the burned man responds, “He ran. But not very fast.”

While in his coma, 
Bran
 dreams of falling and of a crow teaching him to fly. Then he wakes to find himself crippled
and decides to name his 
direwolf
 
Summer
.
Synopsis
Bran
 is dreaming of falling; it seems that he has been falling for years. “But I never fall,” he remembers as he falls.
As the ground gets closer, Bran believes that he will wake up in the instant before he hits the ground, like he always
has before. “And if you don’t?” asks a voice.
A 
crow
 is with him, telling him to fly. Bran insists that he does not know how to fly. The crow asks him if he has
ever tried. Bran then asks the crow if he is really a crow and the crow asks Bran if he is really falling. Bran begins to
cry, but the crow insists the answer is flying not crying and that flying is easy. When Bran mentions that the crow
has wings, the crow says maybe Bran does, too. When Bran searches himself for wings the crow tells him there are
different kinds of wings. Bran asks the crow what he is doing and the crow responds that he is teaching Bran to fly.
When Bran looks down again he can see the whole 
realm
 and everything in it. In 
Winterfell
 he sees the inhabitants
going about their work and sees the 
heart tree
 in the 
godswood
 looking back at him. Bran sees his 
mother
contemplating a blood-stained knife aboard a 
ship
 sailing on the 
Narrow Sea
, and his 
father
 pleading with the 
King
near the 
Trident
. He sees 
Sansa
 crying herself to sleep and 
Arya
 holding her secrets in her heart.
All around his family Bran sees shadows: One as dark as ash with the terrible face of a hound and another in armour
as golden and beautiful as the sun. Over them all looms a giant armoured in stone, but with only darkness and black
blood behind its visor.
In the far east, Bran sees dragons stirring in the fabled 
Shadow Lands
. Bran turns north to 
the Wall
, where he sees
Jon
 sleeping alone and growing cold and hard. Then Bran looks 
beyond the Wall
, and beyond the curtain of light at
the edge of the world, into what he calls the "heart of winter". What he sees there makes him cry. The crow tells
Bran that now he knows why he must live: because winter is coming.
Bran can see spires of ice rising up to impale him and the bodies of a thousand dreamers before him. The crow tells
Bran that he must choose: fly or die. Bran spreads his arms and flies. The crow reacts by pecking at Bran’s face
between his eyes, blinding him.
Suddenly, the crow dissolves into a serving woman with long black hair. Bran realizes he is in Winterfell. The
serving woman drops her basin and runs down the steps shouting, “He is awake.” Bran touches the burning space
between his eyes where he was pecked but cannot feel a thing.
Bran’s 
direwolf
 jumps up onto his legs, but Bran cannot feel it. When his brother 
Robb
 arrives, Bran looks up
calmly and says, “His name is 
Summer
.”

Catelyn
 and Ser

 arrive in 
King's Landing
 by ship. At a secret meeting with 
Petyr Baelish
 and 
Varys
, Catelyn
is told the 
assassin's knife
 belonged to 
Tyrion Lannister
.
Synopsis
As their ship 
Storm Dancer
 prepares to dock in 
King's Landing
, 
Catelyn
 is joined on deck by Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
.
Catelyn notes that Rodrik looks much better than he has for days. Rodrik has been chronically seasick throughout
the voyage, forcing him to shave his befouled cheek whiskers.
After Captain 
Moreo Tumitis
 leaves them, Catelyn and Rodrik discuss how to go about their investigation of the
dagger. Catelyn suggests speaking to the 
Red Keep
's master-at-arms, Ser 
Aron Santagar
, who may recognize the
weapon. Rodrik reminds Catelyn that they must be careful she is not recognized. This brings Lord 
Petyr Baelish
, the
king's 
master of coin
, to Catelyn's mind. Baelish—still known by the nickname “Littlefinger” given to him by her
brother 
Edmure
—was raised with her at 
Riverrun
 as her father 
Hoster's
 ward. They had been close until Petyr had
challenged Catelyn's betrothed, 
Brandon Stark
, for her hand. Brandon had only spared Petyr because Catelyn had
pleaded for his life. After his recovery, Petyr had been sent away and Catelyn has not seen him since. Rodrik
proposes that he go to the Red Keep alone because, without his whiskers, he is unrecognizable even to the few who
might know him.
After they disembark, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik move into a modest old inn suggested by the ship's captain. After
Rodrik leaves, Catelyn tries to get some sleep but is woken by the 
City Watch of King's Landing
. They show her a
seal depicting a mockingbird in grey wax, the sigil of Petyr Baelish. As she prepares to accompany the soldiers (who
do not recognize her), Catelyn wonders how Petyr knew she was in King’s Landing and settles on 
Storm Dancer's
captain as the culprit.
Catelyn is escorted to a tower room occupied by Petyr. When Catelyn asks how he knew she was in the city, Petyr
replies that 
Varys
 knows everything that happens in the city. He does admit, however, that Varys does not know the
reason for Catelyn's visit. Catelyn lies that she merely yearned to see her husband and daughters. Petyr does not
believe this for a moment and asks Catelyn to let him help.
Before Catelyn can answer they are joined by Varys. After profuse courtesies, Varys asks to see the dagger. Catelyn
is astounded by Varys's knowledge of things no one could possibly know and produces the dagger for inspection.
Upon examining the weapon, Petyr reveals that it once belonged to him until he lost it betting on Ser 
Jaime
Lannister
 in the 
tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day
. Petyr explains that when Jaime was unhorsed by Ser 
Loras
Tyrell
, Petyr's dagger was won by 
Tyrion Lannister
.

After training, 
Jon Snow
 is attacked by several other recruits but saved by 
Donal Noye
, who shows Jon the error of
his ways. Then Jon meets up with 
Tyrion
 and later learns from the Lord Commander that 
Bran
 has awoken.
Synopsis
Jon
 is training with the other recruits under 
Castle Black
’s master-at-arms, Ser 
Alliser Thorne
. Jon is by far the most
skilled swordsman and during a sparring match he accidentally injures 
Grenn
. Disgusted with the recruits, Thorne
calls an end to training for the day. Jon knows that Thorne dislikes him, but that he dislikes the other boys more.
Thorne mercilessly berates them all and has given Jon the moniker “Lord Snow” in mockery of Jon’s bastard status.
To Jon’s annoyance, everyone has taken up using the name.
Jon has found Castle Black cold and the people colder. He has no friends among the 20 recruits and finds that he
despises them more as time goes by. Jon resents that nobody but 
Tyrion Lannister
 told him that 
the Wall
 would be
like this. The fact that even 
his father
 never told him makes it hurt all the worse. Even Jon’s uncle 
Benjen
 seems to
have abandoned him, becoming a very different man who spends all his time among the high officers. Three days
after arriving at the Wall, Jon had pleaded to be allowed to come on a ranging with his uncle. Benjen had told him
that he was just a boy who had yet to earn the right to go. Benjen also explained that, while he loved 
his family
, the
men of the 
Night's Watch
 are his true brothers. The next morning, Benjen had had smiles, but not for Jon, telling
him that they would speak when he returns.
Jon goes to his sleeping cell to be with 
Ghost
, thinking of how much he misses his family. His thoughts are
interrupted by the arrival of Grenn, 
Toad
, and two other recruits. All of them are brutes and bullies sent to the Wall
for crimes. After Grenn insults Jon’s mother, a short fight breaks out that soon has Jon on the ground. However,
before the boys can hurt Jon, 
Donal Noye
 the smith intervenes.
After the others leave, Noye tells Jon that the Night’s Watch has need of every man and that there is no honor in
killing boys like Grenn. When Jon insists that they insulted his mother, Noye points out that them saying it doesn’t
make it true. When Noye reminds Jon that he is in the Night's Watch for life, Jon reflects angrily on the fact that
Donal Noye had a life before taking the black. He feasted and wenched and fought in battles, only taking the black
after losing an arm during the siege of 
Pyke
.
Jon claims that the others hate him because he is better than them, but Noye insists that they hate him because he
thinks
 he is better. Noye then calls Jon a bastard and a bully. Being called a bully surprises Jon because his attackers
were all older and bigger than him. Noye explains that Jon has humiliated and shamed the other recruits, who have
had no formal training in swordsmanship whereas Jon was trained by an anointed knight. Jon starts to feel ashamed
but is still angry. Noye tells him to accept his life on the Wall and reconsider how he treats his companions, or else
to sleep with a dagger by his bed.
As he leaves, Jon looks up at the Wall, a massive blue-white cliff of ice that fills up half the sky and dwarfs Castle
Black beneath it. The Wall is the largest structure built by men according to Benjen and the most useless according
to Tyrion. Older than the 
Seven Kingdoms
, to Jon the Wall seems to represent the edge of the world.

Tyrion interrupts Jon’s look up at the Wall by commenting that it makes you wonder about what lies beyond. Since
arriving, Jon has seen little of Tyrion, who has been an honored guest among the high officers. When Tyrion asks
Jon if he is curious about what lies 
beyond the Wall
, Jon replies that there is nothing special but inside wishes he
could have ridden with his uncle Benjen on a ranging. When Tyrion calls him “Lord Snow” by mistake, Jon objects
but Tyrion asks him if he would prefer to be called “the Imp" and reminds Jon to make his weakness his strength by
accepting it.
Tyrion asks about Ghost, and Jon tells him that he chains the 
direwolf
 in the old stables during training but that the
rest of the time he stays with Jon in his sleeping area in Harden’s Tower. Tyrion says he thought those buildings
were abandoned but Jon explains that, since most of the undermanned castle is abandoned, nobody cares where a
person sleeps. He continues on to tell Tyrion that he sleeps alone because the others are afraid of Ghost. Tyrion
declares the others wise, then mentions that Benjen Stark is late returning from his ranging. Jon recalls that his uncle
was supposed to be back by his name day, which is now a fortnight past. Tyrion says that he has heard that a great
number of rangers have disappeared recently.
In the Common Hall, Jon gets food and chooses a spot away from the other recruits and Tyrion sits opposite him.
Ser Alliser interrupts Jon’s conversation to tell him that the 
Lord Commander
 wants to speak with him about a
message concerning his half-brother. Tyrion suspects the worst and gives Jon his sympathy. Jon races to the
Commander’s Keep where Lord Commander 
Jeor Mormont
 gives him a message from 
Robb
 at 
Winterfell
. The
message explains that 
Bran
 has woken up, but is now a paraplegic.
Jon, overjoyed that Bran will live, rushes back to tell Tyrion. In his joy, Jon also apologizes to Grenn and offers to
show him how to defend against the move that injured him. Ser Alliser sarcastically remarks that he would have an
easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than training Grenn to fight. Jon replies that he will take the wager as he would
love to see Ghost juggle. All the men in the hall, including Grenn, begin to laugh. As Ser Alliser clenches his fist in
anger, Jon realizes that he has made himself a life-long enemy.

 is summoned to a meeting of the

 to plan a
tournament
. Afterward, 
Littlefinger
 intercepts him and leads him to where 
Catelyn
 is hiding, where they plan their
strategy for justice.
Synopsis
Ned
 arrives in 
King's Landing
 tired and ready for a meal and a hot bath. Instead, he is immediately informed by the
royal steward that there is an urgent meeting of the 
small council
 that he must attend. After momentarily losing his
temper, Ned decides it is best not to offend the council on his first day in the capital. Therefore, he tasks his own
steward
 to see that his daughters are guided to their rooms and that Arya is not allowed to go exploring.
In borrowed clothes (his are all still packed), Ned arrives to find four members of the council waiting for him:
Littlefinger

Varys
 the

Renly Baratheon

assures Ned they are all praying for Prince 
Joffrey
’s recovery. Ned coldly informs him that the prince grows
stronger every day. When he sees Renly, Ned is struck by how much he looks like a young 
Robert
. Littlefinger
immediately quips that Renly is much better dressed, having spent more on clothes than many ladies of the court.
Upon introducing himself to Ned for the first time, Littlefinger mentions that 
Catelyn
 has most likely mentioned him
before. Ned recalls that Littlefinger also knew his brother, 
Brandon
, adding that Brandon mentioned him often and
with some heat. Littlefinger responds that he would have thought heat did not suit the Starks, who are rumured to be
made of ice and to melt south of the 
Neck
. Ned replies that he does not plan on melting anytime soon.
After a short greeting to Grand Maester Pycelle, Ned asks after the other members of the council and is told that
Stannis Baratheon
 left for 
Dragonstone
 shortly after the king went north and that both Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 and King
Robert are still riding through the city. When Ned suggests they wait, Renly explains that Robert finds the details of
coin and crops boring and rarely bothers to attend. Then Renly says that the king sent him ahead to convene the
council to handle an urgent matter and Littlefinger produces a sealed letter for Ned.
The king's letter contains an order that a 
tourney
 be held in honor of Ned's appointment as 
Hand of the King
. Ned is
incredulous and not particularly happy with this extravagance being held in his name; the prizes alone total ninety
thousand gold dragons and the costs are sure to run high as well. When Ned questions whether the treasury will bear
the expense, Littlefinger reveals that the Crown is already over six million gold pieces in debt, half of it to the
Lannisters
. Ned is shocked; the 
Targaryens
 left a treasury overflowing with gold. He cannot believe that 
Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to beggar the realm, but the council explains that while Lord Arryn was a prudent man, Robert did
not always listen. Ned insists that this tournament is something the realm cannot afford and declares that they will
consider it later, then leaves abruptly.
As Ned proceeds toward the 
Tower of the Hand
, reflecting on the miseries of the last fortnight of the journey south,
he is intercepted by Littlefinger, who tells him he is going the wrong way. After a long journey through the 
Red
Keep
, Ned eventually realizes that Littlefinger is not leading him to the Tower. Littlefinger explains that he is
leading Ned to his wife, but Ned does not believe him. Eventually, Littlefinger brings him to the foot of a bluff

outside the castle, where they mount onto waiting horses and ride into the city.
Littlefinger leads Ned to a brothel he owns and tells him his wife is waiting inside. Ned is furious at being taken all
this way to a brothel and holds a knife to Littlefinger's throat, claiming his brother was too kind. He is interrupted by
a man he eventually recognizes as Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, disarming his suspicions. Littlefinger leads Ned upstairs to
meet with Catelyn, explaining that a brothel is such a good hiding place because it is so unlikely.
After embracing and exchanging news with Catelyn, Ned sees the scars on her hands and she places the 
Valyrian
steel dagger
 used against 
Bran
 in his hands. However, Ned cannot understand why 
Tyrion Lannister
 would have
attempted to murder Bran. Littlefinger states that the reason is obvious, and that Tyrion would have never acted
alone. Ned tries to assure himself that Robert could never have been involved in this, but he remembers all the
horrid things the king has either supported or ignored. Queen 
Cersei
, on the other hand, Ned has no trouble believing
to be responsible. Littlefinger reminds him that to accuse either is treason, but that if they can find proof of Cersei’s
involvement, it is possible the king will listen.
Ned feels that he should take his case and the dagger directly to the king, but Littlefinger reminds him that there is
no solid proof that Tyrion was involved. Then Catelyn explains that she has told Littlefinger about their suspicions
concerning Jon Arryn's death, and that Littlefinger has promised to help them learn the truth. When Ned asks how
much Varys knows about all of this, he is told that Varys has not been told, but Catelyn warns that the man knows
things no normal man has any way of knowing.
Ned then asks Littlefinger to give him time alone with his wife. Littlefinger asks if they want time in a bed chamber
but Ned tells him that will not be necessary; he just needs a little time. Catelyn goes to Littlefinger and tells him that
she appreciates his efforts, and has found a brother that she thought she had lost. Ned is not so confident that
Littlefinger can be trusted, but says nothing. After Littlefinger leaves, Ned gives Catelyn instructions for his
bannermen to fortify 
Moat Cailin
 and to keep a careful watch over 
Theon Greyjoy
 in case 
his father's
 
fleet
 is needed.
He hopes it will not come to war and that Robert will believe him when he finds out what happened.

Tyrion
 dines with high officers of the 
Night's Watch
 and promises 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
 that he will speak to
the 
king
 of their need. Afterwards, while paying a final visit to 
the Wall
, Tyrion meets 
Jon Snow
, who asks Tyrion
to do what he can to help his brother 
Bran
.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 is dining with the high officers of the 
Night's Watch
 on his last night at 
Castle Black
. 
Lord Commander
Mormont
 proclaims Tyrion a cunning man and asks him if he must leave so soon, saying that 
the Wall
 needs men
like him. Tyrion brushes off the suggestion with an offer to scour the 
Seven Kingdoms
 for dwarfs. An offended Ser
Alliser Thorne
 claims that Tyrion mocks the Watch, but Tyrion counters that he is only mocking Ser Alliser. Thorne
demands that Tyrion make his japes with steel in hand. Tyrion replies that he already has steel in his hand: a fork,
which he brandishes against Thorne in a mock attack. A roar of laughter rises from the other officers and Ser Alliser
leaves in disgust.
After claiming Ser Alliser’s meal as his spoils of victory, Tyrion comments that a man like Ser Alliser should be
mucking out the stable, not drilling the recruits. Mormont takes the opportunity to complain about the quality of his
men; Ser Alliser is one of the few living knights to have taken the black. Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
 goes on to explain that
both he and Thorne fought for King 
Aerys II Targaryen
 during the 
Sack of King's Landing
 and were forced to take
the black or be executed by Tyrion’s father, Lord 
Tywin Lannister
. Tyrion’s only comment is that his father is
indeed very fond of heads on spikes.
Tyrion asks for more wine and 
Bowen Marsh
 comments that he has a great thirst for a small man. 
Maester Aemon
states that Tyrion is a giant among them at the edge of the world. Tyrion, speechless at being called a giant, calls the
maester kind, which leaves the maester equally amused.
When they retire to the fire, Mormont informs Tyrion that he will receive an escort as far as 
Winterfell
. Tyrion soon
realizes that the Lord Commander is working his way up to asking a favor and so cuts right to it by asking if there is
any way he can repay the Watch’s kindness. Mormont beseeches Tyrion to speak to King 
Robert
 about the condition
of the Night’s Watch and its need for men. Mormont goes on to elaborate on the high rate of disappearance among
their ranging parties, including Ser 
Waymar Royce
 and 
Benjen Stark
. The Watch’s strength is now under a thousand
men, leaving only three men to guard each mile of the Wall. Then Mormont laments that he is old and there is no
one qualified to take over command because the Watch has become an army of sullen boys and old men. He has
maybe 20 men that can read, and fewer who can think or lead. Tyrion promises that he will tell the King, his father,
and his brother but he knows that it will do no good.
Mormont then asks Tyrion how many winters he has seen. When Tyrion replies with nine, Mormont adds that they
have all been short. The long summer is ending and portents say a long winter is coming. When Tyrion suggest the
fabled endless summer may have come, Mormont insists the days are already growing shorter. Mormont then
confides to Tyrion that the 
wildlings
 are massing and moving south, running scared from something worse than just
the cold. Tyrion, bored by Mormont’s dark words, reiterates his promises and leaves.
Outside it is bitter cold. As he walks the castle ground, Tyrion is taken by a whim to climb the Wall one last time.

His legs are cramping too much to climb the stairs, so Tyrion takes the winch cage up. At the top he meets 
Jon Snow
with 
Ghost
. As they walk, Tyrion asks how the recruits are doing under Jon’s instruction. Jon tells him that they are
getting better.
Tyrion offers to carry any messages that Jon might have south to Winterfell and is rewarded with a torrent of
requests. Most of all Jon wants Tyrion to help his crippled brother 
Bran
. At first, Tyrion denies that has anything to
offer Bran, but Jon insists that words will be enough. When Tyrion agrees, Jon thanks him from the heart and calls
him “friend.” Tyrion, deeply moved by the gesture, quips that while many of his kin are bastards, Jon is the first that
he could call a friend, and they shake hands.
They both look out over the 
Haunted Forest
 north of the Wall. As they watch, Jon says that he has been watching for
his Uncle Benjen. Tyrion assures Jon that Benjen will return one day. When Jon declares that if his uncle does not
come back he and Ghost will go north to find him, Tyrion wonders who will go out searching for Jon and shivers at
the thought.

Arya III
Unhappy at 
King's Landing
, 
Arya
 abandons her dinner. Her 
father
 comes to her room to talk to her and sees she has
her sword
 out. After a long talk, he decides not to take the sword away. Several days later, Arya meets her new
dancing master.
Synopsis
When 
her father
 enters the Small Hall after dinner has already begun Arya can tell that he has been fighting with the
council
 again. 
Jory Cassel
 asks about the 
tourney
 everyone is talking about, and Eddard asks if anyone is talking
about the 
Hand
’s displeasure with the whole idea.
Sansa
 is tremendously excited by the prospect of a tourney and begs to be allowed to attend. When 
Septa
 
Mordane
mentions his family will be expected to attend, Eddard agrees to ensure that seats are provided for both Sansa and
Arya. Knowing that Prince 
Joffrey
 will be there, Arya insists she does not want to attend a stupid tourney. When
Sansa taunts that Arya would not be wanted anyway, Eddard loses his temper and threatens to change his mind.
Quickly regaining his composure, Eddard excuses himself. Once he is gone, his guardsmen start talking excitedly
about the tourney. No one talks to Arya but she likes it that way. Back in 
Winterfell
 she had enjoyed listening to the
men talk, but now the sounds irritate her because she blames them all, even her father, for doing nothing to save
Lady
 and 
Mycah
.
After looking disgustedly at her cold food and the people around her, Arya pushes away from the table. When Septa
Mordane insists that Arya hasn’t eaten, she dashes away. She runs to her chamber and locks herself in. She digs to
the bottom of her chest where her sword 
Needle
 is hidden. Arya thinks that if she could climb like her brother 
Bran
she could steal some food and run away and that if 
Jon Snow
 was there she would not feel so lonely.
A soft knock on her door proves to be her father, who says they need to talk and asks politely to come in. From the
way he talks, Arya is ashamed to realize he is more sad than angry. When she lets him in, her father immediately
notices her sword and asks whose it is. Arya explains that it is hers and her father asks to see it. Her father notices
Mikken
’s mark on the blade and remarks that if his nine-year-old daughter can be armed from his own forge without
his knowledge, how can he be expected to rule the 
Seven Kingdoms
?
Eddard asks who gave her the sword but Arya stays silent, not wanting to betray Jon. Her father accepts this but tells
Arya that a sword is not a toy. When asked what she thinks Septa Mordane would say about her playing with a
sword, Arya insists she was not playing. Eddard states that he should break the sword over his knee. Arya responds
that “Needle wouldn’t break.” The sword having a name amuses her father, who claims that Arya reminds him of his
sister, 
Lyanna
, who might have carried a sword if 
their father
 had allowed it. Arya is surprised when Eddard says
she looks like her aunt, who was always described as beautiful, something never said of Arya.
Eddard asks if Arya knows anything about how to use a sword, and she replies with the advice Jon gave her: “Stick
'em with the pointy end.” She tells how she was trying to learn and sadly adds that she asked Mycah to practice with
her. In grief she starts to sob against her father’s chest. He tells her that Mycah’s death was not her fault. Arya sobs
that she hates them all: the 
Queen
, the Hound, Joffrey, and the King. Then she adds that Joffery lied, and that she

also hates Sansa.
Eddard says that everyone lies and that he does not believe that 
Nymeria
 ran off. Arya then exclaims that Jory
promised not to tell. Eddard informs her that Jory did not tell but that he had figured it out, because even a blind man
could tell that the wolf would not have left willingly. Arya then explains how she and Jory had to throw rocks to
drive the wolf away. She then asks her father if she did the right thing and Eddard assures her that she did.
Eddard then tells Arya that winter is coming. He explains to her how wolves stick together, and that in the winter a
lone wolf dies. Now there are enemies threatening the 
Starks
, so they must stick together like a pack of wolves and it
is time for her to start growing up. He hands Arya back her sword, saying she can keep it; he only asks that she not
stick her sister.
Three days later, Arya is sent to the Small Hall by the 
steward
. She is met by 
Syrio Forel
, a former 
First Sword
 of
Braavos
. He tells her that he is her dancing master, and throws her a wooden sword, which she cannot catch.
Unperturbed, Syrion tells Arya that the next day she will be there at midday and catch the blade. She picks the
practice sword up as instructed and finds that it is very heavy. When she complains about the weight, Syrio explains
that it is heavy to make her strong. Then he fixes her grip, telling her not to squeeze too tight. When Arya says that
she might drop it, Syrio tells her that the sword must become a part of her arm, and that she cannot drop a part of her
arm.
When Syrio calls her a boy for the third time Arya objects. He insists that it does not matter; a sword has no gender.
He then explains that what he will be teaching her is not the hacking and hammering iron dance of 
Westeros
, but the
swift and sudden Water Dance of Braavos,. Then he tells her to try to strike him, and she tries unsuccessfully for
four hours until every muscle is sore. The next day the real work begins.

Daenerys
 learns to embrace her life in 
Drogo
's 
khalasar
, and stands up to 
Viserys
 for the first time. Afterward, when
Drogo arrives to have sex with her, she rides him instead of being taken from behind and becomes pregnant.
Synopsis
Daenerys
 looks out for the first time onto the vast, empty, flat plain of the 
Dothraki Sea
 with Ser 
Jorah Mormont
beside her. Daenerys sees she has out-distanced the rest of 
Drogo
’s 
khalasar
, who are still climbing the ridge behind
her. Among them she can see her brother 
Viserys
 struggling with his riding. The sight brings back the memory of
Illyrio Mopatis
 offering to let Viserys stay in 
Pentos
 as his guest. Viserys had refused and insisted on coming with
the 
khalasar
 to ensure that Drogo would give him the army that he promised. Daenerys commands Jorah and the
others to wait. Mormont comments that Daenerys is starting to sound like a queen but Daenerys corrects him, calling
herself a 
khaleesi
.
As she rides out alone, Daenerys reflects on how the days of the journey have hardened her body. She no longer has
open saddle sores nor does she suffer unbearable pain after a day’s ride. At first, Drogo would ignore Daenerys to
spend his days talking, drinking, and racing with his 
bloodriders
, leaving her to eat meals alone or with Viserys and
Jorah Mormont. Yet every night Drogo would come and ride her from behind. She had been miserable until she had
dreamt of a dragon that engulfed her in flame and cleansed her. After that, each day had been easier than the one
before it and she had found pleasure in the new sights of the journey, even starting to enjoy sex with Drogo.
Once she is totally alone, Daenerys decides to dismount and take off her boots so she can feel the earth. Suddenly,
Viserys is there, screaming and grabbing her. He is furious that she commanded him to stay on the ridge with the
others. For the first time in her life, Daenerys shoves him back. For a moment Viserys is shocked, but then the rage
returns and Daenerys sees that he intends to hurt her badly. Before he can, 
Jhogo
’s whip catches Viserys around the
neck and pulls him to the ground.
Her handmaiden 
Irri
 translates for them as Jhogo asks if Daenerys would like to see Viserys dead or disfigured as
punishment for his attack. Daenerys declines, but tells them to take Viserys’ horse and make him walk, an
emasculating punishment among the horselords. Viserys, now recovered enough to shout, orders Ser Jorah to kill the
Dothraki and discipline Daenerys, but the exiled knight makes the decision to turn to Daenerys and agree that
Viserys should walk.
Daenerys is amazed that she hit Viserys and asks Jorah if she has woken the dragon in Viserys. Jorah replies her
brother Rhaegar was the last Dragon, while Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake. Daenerys insists that Viserys
is still the rightful king, but when Jorah asks if she would want her brother as the king, she realizes that Viserys’
would not be a good king. Even so, Daenerys remains convinced that the people of 
Westeros
 are praying for Viserys
return until Jorah explains that peasants only pray for rain, health, and a summer that never ends. Daenerys declares
that Viserys will never be able to retake the 
Seven Kingdoms
, realizing that she has known this for a long time.
Viserys could not lead an army even if her husband gave him one.
Daenerys races her silver ahead of Jorah and the others. It is dusk by the time she returns to the 
khalasar
. Daenerys
imagines the laughter in the 
khalasar
 when news spreads about Viserys; by the time her brother can return, everyone

in the camp will know him as a walker.
As she enters her tent, Daenerys sees a finger of light touch her dragon eggs and, for a moment, she sees scarlet
flames before her eyes. When she touches the eggs they feel hot, which she attributes to the sunshine during the day.
Daenerys remembers all of the stories about other magical creatures and wonders why there should not also be
dragons. Her Dothraki handmaidens, 
Irri
 and 
Jhiqui
, tell her that dragons were all killed by men. However, her
Lysene
 handmaiden 
Doreah
, a former sex slave, tells Daenerys a story about a time when there were two moons in
the sky, but one came too close to the sun and cracked to release the first dragons. The story ends by claiming that
one day the other moon will crack and the dragons will return. The other handmaidens make fun of the story,
insisting that the moon is a goddess, not an egg.
Daenerys sends Irri and Jhiqui away but orders Doreah to stay with her for dinner. When Drogo returns, she takes
him outside because Dothraki customs say that everything of importance must be done under the open sky. When
Drogo tries to take her from behind, Daenerys tells him that she wants to see his face and climbs on top of him. She
rides Drogo as fiercely as she has ever ridden her horse and in the moment of his pleasure Drogo calls out her name.
On the far side of the Dothraki Sea, on her 14th name day, Daenerys’ handmaiden Jhiqui brushes her stomach and
tells her that she is pregnant.

Bran
 is roused from his depression when he is called to the Great Hall of 
Winterfell
 to receive 
Tyrion Lannister
.
Despite 
Robb
’s rudeness, Tyrion provides plans for a saddle that will allow Bran to ride a horse once more.
Synopsis
Bran
 watches from his window seat as 
Rickon
 plays with the 
direwolves
 in the yard below. 
Shaggydog
’s fur has
darkened to black and his eyes are fiery-green; 
Summer
 has turned to silver-and-smoke with yellow-gold eyes that
see everything. Summer is smaller and warier than 
Grey Wind
, but Bran thinks he is the smartest. Bran realizes he is
crying; he wants to be down there laughing and running. Bitterly, he declares that the 
crow
 in his 
dream
 lied about
being able to fly.
Old Nan
 agrees that crows are all liars and offers to tell Bran a story about a crow, but Bran is not in the mood and
snaps that he hates her stories. Old Nan explains that the stories are not hers; they 
are
, before her and after her. Bran
remembers 
his father
 telling him that she was called “Old Nan” even when he was a child. Possibly the oldest person
in the 
Seven Kingdoms
, Nan has outlived all her own family except the simple-minded stableboy named 
Hodor
.
Bran insists that he hates the stories no matter whose they are. Unperturbed, Old Nan offers to tell a story about a
boy who hated stories.
Bran does not want any stories; he wants his parents, and to run, and climb, and ride like before. His father had
promised he could ride a real horse south, but left without him. Bran broods on all the people who have left
Winterfell
 and seem to have forgotten him. Only 
Robb
 and Rickon remain and even Robb has changed: he never
smiles now and is so busy as the lord of Winterfell that he has little time for Bran.
When Nan offers to tell him about 
Brandon the Builder
, Bran insists that his favorite stories were the scary ones.
Nan replies, “Oh, my sweet summer child, what do you know of fear?” Bran listens intently as Nan begins the story
of the first time 
the Others
 came in the darkness of winter. Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell like
no other, and there came 
a night that lasted a generation
. In that darkness came the Others: cold dead things that
hated fire, iron, the touch of the sun, and every creature with warm blood. They overran holdfasts and cities and all
the swords of men could not stop their advance. Women and children were not spared, and the Others ate the flesh
of children. This was before the 
Andals
 and the 
Rhoynar
 had come, when the 
First Men
 lived in the lands they had
taken from the 
children of the forest
. The 
last hero
 of the First Men set out to find the children with his sword, a dog,
his horse, and twelve companions. All of the hero’s companions and even his dog died, and he was left in despair of
ever finding the children as the Others closed in.
Old Nan’s story is interrupted by 
Maester
 
Luwin
, who tells Bran that he is needed in the Great Hall to greet 
Tyrion
Lannister
 and some men of the 
Night’s Watch
, who are down from 
the Wall
 with a message from his brother 
Jon
.
Bran complains that he wants to hear the rest of Nan’s story, but Nan tells him that stories can wait. Hodor, the
seven-foot stableboy, carries Bran down to the hall with Maester Luwin struggling to keep up.
Robb is sitting in his father’s high seat, wearing his armor with his sword across his lap. Even Bran knows what it
means to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword and can feel the hostility in the room. Robb makes a point of only
offering his welcome to the Night’s Watch men. The meaning is not lost on Tyrion, who notes that he is not

welcome and calls Robb a boy. Robb seethes, insisting that he is a lord. Tyrion responds that if that is so he needs to
show a lord’s courtesy.
When Bran is brought forward, Tyrion notes that news of his survival was true and declares that Starks are hard to
kill. Robb declares that the 
Lannisters
 had best remember that and lifts Bran into the high seat. Tyrion asks how
Bran fell, but Bran insists that he 
never
 falls. Maester Luwin is quick to add that Bran does not remember. Tyrion
calls this curious, then asks if Bran likes to ride. Immediately, the maester insists that Bran has lost the use of his
legs, and so cannot ride. Tyrion responds that with the right saddle and horse even a cripple can ride. Angered, Bran
insists that he is not a cripple, but Tyrion retorts that if that is true then he is not a dwarf. Tyrion hands the maester a
paper containing plans he has drawn up for a saddle for Bran. The maester states that it will work and he should
have thought of it himself. Tyrion responds that the idea came easier to him, since the design is similar to his own
saddle. Robb is suspicious of Tyrion’s motive, to which Tyrion replies that Jon asked it of him, and he has a weak
spot for cripples, bastards, and broken things.
Rickon comes in from outside with the three direwolves, who immediately start growling and surround Tyrion.
Theon
 comments that the wolves do not like Tyrion’s smell. Tyrion says that it is time he took his leave, but the
wolves assault him before he can move more than a step. They are called off in time by the boys. Tyrion finds the
hostility of the wolves to be interesting, and states nothing is harmed save his dignity. Even Robb is shaken and says
he does not know why the wolves attacked. Before Tyrion can leave, Maester Luwin confers with Robb, who then
offers the hospitality of Winterfell to Tyrion. Tyrion declines the invitation as a false courtesy, declaring that he will
stay in the inn he saw outside the wall.
Robb then tells the Night’s Watch men they have rooms prepared, and invites them for dinner. Bran is looking
forward to feasting that night with the Night’s Watch. In his room, Bran expresses his excitement at being able to
ride again to Summer. Bran dreams of climbing, and sees the shapes of twisted and grotesque gargoyles, and then he
hears them whispering. The gargoyles pull themselves free and climb towards Bran. Bran starts to scream, shouting
that he did not hear. He wakes to find Hodor above him. Hodor cleans and dresses him and carries him down to the
Great Hall.
That evening, Robb and Bran host the Night’s Watch men for dinner. The black brothers bring the dire tidings of
Benjen Stark
. 
Yoren
 states that Benjen is probably dead, but Robb vehemently disagrees. One of the brothers
assures them that Benjen knows the haunted forest better than anyone, and will find his way back. Bran thinks of
Old Nan’s stories and blurts out that uncle Benjen will be saved by the children of the forest. Maester Luwin tells
him the children have been dead for thousands of years, but Yoren disagrees, wondering who’s to say what lives
beyond the Wall?
That night Robb carries Bran up to his bed himself. Robb sits by Bran for a long time, and tells him that they will
find a horse for him. Bran asks if the others will be coming back. Robb says yes with much hope in his voice. Robb
then tells Bran that he can meet his mother riding his new horse and later they can visit the Wall together.

autumn and a terrible long winter. Then Pycelle digresses about being a young man, forging his maester’s chain
during the reign of King

Finally, Pycelle remembers that Ned asked about

 didn’t understand the older body and was endangering Lord Arryn's life with purging potions.
Ned asks if Lord Arryn had any final words. Pycelle responds that Jon Arryn called out the name “Robert” several
times, but does not know if he was talking about 
the king
 or 
his son
. His last words were whispered to 
Lysa Arryn
and King Robert: "The seed is strong."
Next, Ned asks if there was anything unnatural about the death, and follows up by asking if Pycelle had seen
anything like this illness before. Pycelle states that he has seen more of illness than he would like to remember and
that every illness is different and yet alike. Eventually, Pycelle says that Jon Arryn’s death was no stranger than any
other. When Ned mentions that Lysa thinks otherwise, Pycelle says that grief can derange minds--and Lysa’s mind
was not the best before, seeing enemies in every corner.
When Ned suggests that Jon Arryn could have been poisoned, the Grand Maester rebuffs him, asking who would do
such a thing. Ned replies that he has heard poison is a woman’s weapon. Pycelle replies that poison is the preferred
weapon of women, cravens, and eunuchs. He continues by telling Ned that 
Varys
 was born a slave in 
Lys
, and that
Ned shouldn’t trust him. Ned scarcely needs reminding, as he already has a bad feeling about Varys.
Ned excuses himself but the Grand Maester halts him to offer any other service Ned may require. Ned uses the
opportunity to ask for the book Jon Arryn asked for. Pycelle says it is a ponderous tome of lineages that Ned would
find boring. Ned insists he would like to see the book in any case, and Pycelle promises to send it to him once he
finds it. On the way out, Ned also learns that Queen 
Cersei
 was not in 
King's Landing
 when Jon Arryn died.
Pycelle’s parting words are “I am here to serve,” leading Ned to think, “Yes, but whom.”
On his return to the 
Tower of the Hand
, Ned finds 
Arya
 on the steps, standing on one foot. When Ned asks what she
is doing she tells him that 
Syrio Forel
 says that a 
water dancer
 can stand on one toe for hours. Ned expresses his
concern about her falling down the steps but Arya states that a water dancer never falls. Then Arya asks if 
Bran
 will

come to live with them now, and Ned responds that first he must grow stronger. Speaking of Bran leads Ned to
recall taking the girls to the castle 
godswood
 to offer their thanks when the news of Bran’s recovery arrived. The
girls had gone to sleep and dreamed of Bran while Ned stood vigil all night.
While balancing on her leg, Arya asks about Bran’s plans to be a knight of the 
Kingsguard
. Ned admits that Bran
won't become a knight, but he may become a lord, a councilor, an architect, an explorer, or even the 
High Septon
,
even while privately noting that Bran will never lie with a woman or father a son. When Arya asks if she can do any
of these things, Ned says that she will marry a king and her sons will do these things. Arya replies that that is 
Sansa
,
not her.
Later, Ned meets with 
Littlefinger
 in his solar. Littlefinger, who is watching the Kingsguard practicing in the yard
below, starts with small talk about who might win the tourney. This does not interest Ned at all, so he asks
Littlefinger to get to the point. Ned cannot find it in himself to trust Littlefinger. Littlefinger tells him that four of
Jon Arryn’s household are still in the city, which surprises Ned, who thought that all had gone back to the 
Eyrie
 with
Lysa.
Littlefinger reveals the names, which include Jon Arryn's squire, Ser 
Hugh
 of the Vale. He also reveals that Ser
Hugh was knighted by the king after Lord Arryn died. Ned states that he will send for them, but Littlefinger does not
think this is a good idea and asks Ned to come to the window. Littlefinger identifies some of the spies among those
outside his window: one is Varys’, the other is the queen’s. He tells Ned that there are others, and some even he does
not know. He cautions Ned to send a man he trusts completely to question these people rather than doing it himself;
even Varys cannot watch every man in Ned's service every hour of the day. As Littlefinger departs, Ned expresses
his gratitude and says he was perhaps wrong to distrust him. Littlefinger fingers his beard and replies that distrusting
him is the wisest thing Ned has done since he climbed down off his horse.

Samwell Tarly
 appears in the yard while 
Jon
 is training the other recruits. When Ser 
Alliser Thorne
 orders Sam
beaten after he yields, Jon and his friends aid the new recruit. Later Jon talks with Sam and, afterwards, convinces
the other recruits to go easy on Sam, despite Thorne’s commands.
Synopsis
Jon
 is helping the other recruits with their swordsmanship when 
Samwell Tarly
, the fattest boy he has ever seen,
enters the yard. Sam nervously explains he has been told to come there for training, and 
Pyp
 identifies him by his
voice as a lordling from near 
Highgarden
. Sam is immediately ridiculed by Ser 
Alliser Thorne
, who says they are
now sending pigs to man 
the Wall
. Although Sam has brought his own armor, none of it is black so he has to be
reequipped, which requires some ingenuity by the armorer.
When Sam returns, Ser Alliser sends 
Halder
, a very strong boy, against him. In under a minute Sam is on the ground
with a broken helm, screaming that he yields. When Sam refuses to stand up, Thorne tells Halder to hit him with the
flat of the blade until he gets up. The initial hit is tentative, but Thorne insists that Halder can hit harder and the next
blow splits leather. Jon’s objections are initially stopped by Pyp, but after another blow Jon shakes him off and
states there is no honor in beating a beaten foe.
Jon helps Sam up, which Ser Alliser mocks as “defending his lady love.” Declaring it a training exercise, Thorne
sends Halder, 
Rast
, and 
Albett
 to get past Jon to beat Sam. Jon braces himself for a hard fight; Ser Alliser has sent
two boys against him before, but never three. To Jon’s surprise, Pyp and 
Grenn
 come to his aid. The boys going
against Jon hesitate, but Jon attacks. Jon soon takes out Halder, but not before taking a damaging blow to his
shoulder. Then he helps Pyp take down Rast. Once Rast is down, Albett yields and Ser Alliser leaves in a fury.
Halder wrenches off his helmet and throws it across the yard, declaring that he thought he had Jon. Jon admits that
he almost did. When Jon attempts to remove his helmet, his shoulder is painful. Sam, his head bloody where his
helmet had been split, comes over and helps Jon remove the helmet gently. Sam introduces himself and Jon
introduces himself, Grenn, and Pyp; Sam thanks them all. When asked why he did not fight back, Sam states that
couldn’t because he is a coward. Jon and his friends are speechless—who would admit that he was coward? Seeing
the response of Jon and his friends, Sam apologizes to them, stating he does not like being a coward. As Sam leaves
for the armory, Jon tells him tomorrow he will do better, but Sam insists that he will not.
After Sam leaves, Grenn states nobody likes cowards, and is worried what others will think if they are associated
with a coward. Pyp’s response is that if Grenn met a bear in the woods he would be too stupid to run away. Grenn
insists he would run faster than Pyp, then attacks Pyp when he realizes the trick.
For the recruits, mornings are for swordplay and afternoons for other work, which is varied so that the Watch can
measure a recruit’s skills. That afternoon Jon is to spread gravel on top of the wall by himself. This gives him a
chance to contemplate Sam. He thinks about 
Tyrion Lannister
’s statement about denying a hard truth and realizes
that Sam’s admission of cowardice took a certain kind of courage.
When he enters the common hall where dinner is almost done, Jon passes his friends and joins Sam, who is sitting

by himself. After introducing 
Ghost
 and some polite conversation, Jon asks Sam to join him outside to talk. As they
walk, Sam admits that he did not think the 
Night’s Watch
 would be like this; all the buildings are falling down, and
it is so cold. Jon suggests it must have been warmer where Sam lived, and Sam explains that he had never seen snow
until a month ago.
Jon leads Sam to 
the Wall
, but Sam balks at climbing the great wooden stairs. Jon replies that there is a winch, but
Sam states he does not like heights. When Jon asks why a boy who is afraid of everything would join the Night’s
Watch, Sam starts to cry until Ghost licks his face, which makes them both laugh. They continue talking and before
long Jon starts talking about 
Winterfell
. Jon reveals a dream he’s been having of returning to Winterfell to find it
completely empty. As he is telling about the dream, Jon thinks about how several rangings have been made to find
Benjen Stark
, whose trail just disappears. In his dream, Jon always finds himself descending the stairs to the crypt in
dark, and it is then that he wakes up.
Jon asks if Sam ever dreams of 
Horn Hill
. Sam insists that he does not, and that he hated it there. After a long
silence, Sam tells the story of why he was sent to the Wall. His father, Lord 
Randyll Tarly
, was disgusted that his
eldest son was so plump, soft, awkward, and squeamish. Sam’s interest in music, books, dancing, and soft clothes
only made matters worse. Many masters-at-arms were brought to Horn Hill to try to make Sam into the type of
many his father wanted. When a second son, 
Dickon
 was finally born, Lord Randyll had given up on Sam. On his
15th name day, Sam says, he was escorted to his father in a wood, where he was informed that he was to forsake his
claim to Horn Hill and join the Night’s Watch, or else his father would arrange an accident. Jon finds it strange that
Sam tells the story in such a detached voice and does not weep even once. Jon tells Sam about some of the other
recruits, and Sam eventually states he should get some sleep and plods off.
Jon returns to the common room. His friends explain that they did not shun Sam; there were places on the bench but
Sam was such a craven that he just passed them by. Jon persuades them all to not beat Sam anymore, whatever Ser
Alliser says. 
Rast
, however, insists that if Thorne sends him against “Lady Piggy,” he will cut off a rasher of bacon,
and laughs in Jon’s face. That night, Jon—with Pyp, Grenn, and Ghost—visits Rast in his cell. With Ghost’s mouth
around Rast's throat, Jon tells Rast that they know where he sleeps.
After that, no matter what Ser Alliser does, he cannot get any of the recruits to do anything but tap Sam when they
are put up against him. Sam later thanks Jon and calls him his first friend; Jon responds that they are not friends but
brothers. Jon now realizes that 
Robb
, 
Bran
 and 
Rickon
 are his father’s sons, but that he has never been one of them;
his true brothers are the outcasts of the Night’s Watch. He realizes his uncle was right, and wonders if he will ever
see Benjen again to tell him.

Ned
 and the 
small council
 deal with policing problems caused by the upcoming 
tourney
. After the meeting, 
Jory
Cassel
 reports to Ned on interviews with 
Jon Arryn
’s remaining household. The report includes mention of visits by
Lord Arryn and 
Stannis Baratheon
 to a 
brothel
 and an 
armorer
. Ned orders Jory to identify the brothel and goes to
visit the armorer himself. There he discovers an apprentice named 
Gendry
 who looks astonishingly like King
Robert
.
Synopsis
Ned
 and the 
small council
 hear 
City Watch
 Commander 
Janos Slynt
’s report about the significant increase in crime
caused by the influx of people arriving for the upcoming tourney. Slynt requests more men. Ned agrees to hire fifty
new watchmen, setting 
Littlefinger
 to arrange the monetary details. When Littlefinger objects, Ned insists that since
he found 40,000 
gold dragons
 for the champion’s purse, he should be able to scrape together a few coppers to keep
the King’s Peace. Ned also loans Slynt twenty of his own household guard.
Ned complains again about the tourney, still irritated that it is to be called "
the Hand's tourney
" despite his distaste.
Moreover, King 
Robert
 still insists that Ned should feel honored. Grand 
Maester
 
Pycelle
 points out that a tourney is
good for the realm because it brings the great an opportunity for glory and the lowly a respite from their woes.
Littlefinger adds that it brings in lots of money, emphasizing full inns and whores walking bowlegged. Lord 
Renly
laughs, telling how his brother 
Stannis
 once proposed outlawing brothels, prompting Robert to ask if he wanted to
outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing as well. Renly goes on to wonder how Stannis ever fathered his 
daughter
 when
he goes to his marriage bed like he is marching to a battlefield to do his duty. Everyone laughs except Ned, who is
preoccupied by thoughts of when Stannis will return and assume his 
duties
 on the council.
After the council adjourns, Ned returns to the 
Tower of the Hand
 and summons 
Jory Cassel
. As he waits for his
horse to be saddled, Ned peruses the book that 
Jon Arryn
 had been reading prior to his death: 
Lineages of the Great
Houses
 by Grand Maester 
Malleon
. Its reading has proven extremely tedious, just as Pycelle warned, and scarcely a
man now alive had been born when it was written, but Ned is sure 
Jon Arryn
 had a reason for reading it. As he
browses the section on 
House Lannister
, Ned muses on their long history and the myths of their ancestor 
Lann the
Clever
, who stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair.
Jory arrives and briefs Ned on his interview with one of Jon Arryn’s stableboys, the last of the four leads provided
by Littlefinger. Ser 
Hugh
 proved brusque, arrogant, and uninformative. The serving girl could only say that Jon
Arryn had been reading too much, concerned about his 
son
’s frailty, and gruff with his 
wife
. Meanwhile, the pot boy
was only able to provide lots of kitchen gossip, including that Lord Stannis had accompanied Lord Arryn to meet an
armorer
 about elaborate new armor. The stableboy proves just as informative. He swears that Lord Arryn was as
strong as a man half his age and often went riding with Lord Stannis. This Ned finds strange; as far as he knew, Jon
and Stannis were never friendly. Jory says that the stableboy also claims that Stannis and Jon Arryn visited a brothel
together. Unfortunately, the boy did not know which brothel; only the guards that escorted them would know, and
they were taken back to the 
Eyrie
 with Lady 
Lysa
.
That Stannis would visit a brothel is very strange because he is so stern and humorless. That Stannis’ name keeps
coming up and that he has left the city with no word about when he will return also vexes Ned. He wonders why

Stannis would leave and decides that something must have frightened him, yet Ned cannot imagine what could have
frightened Stannis, who withstood the year-long 
Siege of Storm's End
 by surviving on rats and boot leather. Both
Ned and Jory find it frustrating that that everyone that might know the truth is a thousand leagues away. When Jory
asks if he will call Stannis back from 
Dragonstone
, Ned says not yet.
Ned plans to visit the armorer himself and decides to wear his doublet with the direwolf sigil so the armorer will
know who he is. As Jory dresses him, Ned wonders why Renly was not invited on the rides. Ned does not know
what to make of Renly with his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days back, Renly showed him a locket with a
picture of 
Margaery Tyrell
. He asked Ned if she resembled 
Lyanna
 and seemed disappointed when Ned shrugged.
Ned finds it queer that Renly, who looks so much like 
Robert
, would be obsessed with a lady that he thought looked
like Lyanna.
Ned tells Jory that it would be good if Stannis returned for the tourney, but Jory’s response makes Ned more certain
that Stannis will not. He also wonders why Lord Arryn would be interested in showy armor when he had always
considered armor something for protection, not ornament. Ned then tells Jory that he better start visiting brothels,
which Jory jokingly calls a “hard duty.”
The streets of 
King’s Landing
 are crowded, but Ned and his guardsmen 
Varly
 and 
Jacks
 make it through the crowd
to the 
Mud Gate
 where Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
 is arriving with his retinue to participate in the Tourney of the Hand.
At the 
top
 of the 
Street of Steel
 they find the huge house of the armorer 
Tobho Mott
. After shouldering his way in, a
serving girl notices Ned’s sigil and badge of office and Tobho Mott quickly appears, offering wine. Mott
immediately tells Ned that his prices are not cheap but his craftsmanship in unequaled in the 
Seven Kingdoms
. He
adds proudly that 
the Knight of Flowers
 buys all his armor from him and that he can work 
Valyrian steel
.
Ned lets the armorer go on for a while before he asks if Jon Arryn bought a falcon helm from him. Mott says that
Lord Arryn bought nothing, only wanting to see the apprentice boy named 
Gendry
. Any hint of friendliness leaves
Mott when Ned asks to see the boy as well. In the hot stone barn that contains the forges, the armorer introduces
Gendry and shows Ned a helmet that the boy has crafted. Ned notes that the unfinished helm is expertly shaped and
offers to buy it. Gendry immediately grabs the helmet back, insisting it is not for sale. Mott rushes to offer apologies
for Gendry’s behavior, but Ned states there is nothing to forgive.
Ned asks Gendry what he and Jon Arryn talked about. Gendry explains that Lord Arryn asked about his age, if he
was well treated, and about his mother. Ned asks about the boy’s mother as well, and is told that she is dead, but that
she was an alehouse wench with blonde hair. Ned examines Gendry and notices a remarkable resemblance to a
younger King Robert, especially his black hair and blue eyes.
Ned asks Mott who paid the boy’s apprentice fee. Mott claims he took the boy on for free since he was so strong.
Ned does not believe this for a moment. Mott admits that an unknown lord had paid twice the normal apprentice fee
for Gendry and said the extra money was for his silence. Ned decides he likes Tobho Mott. Before he leaves, Ned
tells Mott to send Gendry to him if the day comes that he wants to wield a sword instead of forge one. Ned also
quips that if he ever wants a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place he visits.
As he rejoins his guards outside, Ned still doesn’t understand what Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s bastard, nor why
it led to his death.

Catelyn
 and Ser 
Rodrik
 take shelter from the rain at the 
inn at the crossroads
. Soon after, 
Tyrion Lannister
 and his
party arrive. Tyrion recognizes Catelyn, who had hoped to remain anonymous, and Catelyn takes this opportunity to
convince the men in the room to take Tyrion captive so he can face the king’s justice in 
Winterfell
.
Synopsis
Catelyn
 and Ser 
Rodrik
 are on the 
kingsroad
, headed north to 
Winterfell
. It is raining and Ser Rodrik suggests
Catelyn should cover her head to keep from taking a chill. Catelyn, however, enjoys the feel of the rain on her face
and replies that it is only water. The warm southern rain reminds Catelyn of her childhood with 
Edmure
, 
Lysa
, and
Littlefinger
 at 
Riverrun
. Rains are much less pleasant in 
the North
.
Rodrik states it would be good to have a fire and a warm meal. Catelyn tells him that there is an 
inn at the crossroads
only a short way ahead. Catelyn remembers sleeping there many times when traveling with her 
father
 when she was
young, when it was run by a fat woman named 
Masha Heddle
. Ser Rodrik reminds her that an inn is too public and
that it might be best to find a small holdfast if they do not want to be recognized. However, when they pass
unrecognized by a party of soldiers led by Lord 
Jason Mallister
, a bannerman to her father, Catelyn decides they will
not be recognized at the inn.
At the inn, they are met by Masha Heddle, who gives them only a cursory look and tells them there are only two
rooms available; she gives them none of the smiles or mention of sweet cakes that Catelyn remembers from her
girlhood. After changing into dry clothes, Catelyn thinks that from the crossroads they could go west to 
Riverrun
where she could get advice from her father who has been unwell lately. To the east is the 
Eyrie
 and her sister; Lysa
might be able to provide some answers, but the road across the mountains is too dangerous. Eventually, Catelyn
decides that it is best to continue north to 
Winterfell
. Once past 
the Neck
 they can get aid from one of the bannermen
of 
House Stark
. Then she can tell the bannerman to send riders north to 
Robb
 with orders to place a watch on the
kingsroad.
Catelyn turns her thoughts to the reliability of Riverrun’s banners. If it comes to war, Catelyn is sure her father will
call his banners, but she is not sure they will all come. 
Robert's Rebellion
 showed how unreliable the river lords can
be, particularly the 
Freys
, who arrived to aid their Tully overlords only after the 
Battle of the Trident
 had been won,
leaving doubts as to which army they had come to join. Ever since, Catelyn's father has called Lord 
Walder Frey
 the
“Late Lord Frey". Other banners—such as the 
Darrys
, 
Rygers
, and 
Mootons
—fought for King 
Aerys II Targaryen
.
Catelyn decides she must not let a war erupt.
Ser Rodrik comes to escort her to dinner, suggesting they must hurry if they are to eat and calling her the customary
“my lady.” Catelyn decides it might be safer to pretend they are father and daughter. Rodrik agrees, but in the
process he calls her “my lady” again, and comments on how old ways die hard when he realizes his mistake.
In the long and drafty common room the benches are crowded with a wide variety of people, but Catelyn doesn't see
anyone who might recognize her. Ser Rodrik finds them a place by the kitchen where they are accosted by the singer
Marillion
, who asks about where they come from and where they are going. Catelyn answers the safest of the
questions, saying they come from 
King's Landing
. The singer tells them that is his destination for the 
Tourney of the

Hand
. The singer is disappointed when Catelyn has not heard about him, and proceeds to attempt to get paid silver
for a song. Ser Rodrik, believing that any healthy boy would prefer a sword to a lyre, tells him he might have a
couple of coppers but would prefer tossing them down a well to hearing the boy’s howling. The singer then tells
how he was made to sing for kings and high lords. Catelyn asks if Marillion has ever played for Lord Tully. The
singer boasts that a chamber is kept for him at Riverrun and that the young Lord Tully is like a brother. This amuses
Catelyn, who knows her brother has hated singers ever since one bedded a girl he liked.
It is then that the door bangs open and the arrival of 
Tyrion Lannister
 is announced, with a demand for room and a
bath for Tyrion. When Tyrion is told that there are no rooms, he announces that his servants can sleep in the stable,
and quips that he needs only a small room. When Masha Heddle repeats that there are no rooms, Tyrion takes a gold
coin and flips it into the air. A free rider tells Tyrion he is welcome to his take his room, and Tyrion flips the coin to
the man.
Tyrion declares that he wants some sort of roast fowl and the best wine sent up to his room, and asks the 
black
brother
 
Yoren
 to join him. Marillion the singer stands and offers to sing to Tyrion of his father’s 
victory
 at King's
Landing while he dines. Tyrion replies that such a song would surely ruin his supper. He is about to turn away when
his eyes find Catelyn, and he comments that he was sorry to have missed her at Winterfell. Everyone in the inn is
astonished, and every eye is turned to Catelyn as she stands.
Catelyn decides to play her hand. She asks some of the men-at-arms in the room directly if their lords are true to her
father, Lord Hoster Tully. The 
Brackens
, 
Freys
, and 
Whents
 are all represented in the room, and all answer with
polite agreement. Tyrion is confused and asks what Catelyn is doing, even sniggering at one of the comments.
Catelyn then tells the bannermen that Tyrion, while a 
guest
 in her home, sent an assassin to murder 
her son
 in his
bed. In the name of King 
Robert
 and the lords they serve, Catelyn calls upon them to seize Tyrion and return him to
Winterfell to await the king’s justice.
Catelyn cannot decide which is more satisfying: the sound of a dozen men drawing their swords or the look on
Tyrion Lannister’s face.

Sansa III
Sansa
 is enthralled by the 
tourney
, especially the knights. Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 kills a new-made knight named Ser
Hugh
 in a joust, and after a victory Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 gives her a rose. During the feast that follows, Prince 
Joffrey
 is
very courteous, but afterward he orders 
the Hound
 to escort Sansa back to her chambers. When the Hound notices
Sansa is avoiding looking at his burned face, he forces her to look and tells her how he acquired it.
Synopsis
Sansa
 rides to 
the Hand's tourney
 in a litter with 
Septa
 
Mordane
 and 
Jeyne Poole
. The splendor takes Sansa’s breath
away, the knights most of all. All of the 
Kingsguard
 are there in pure white cloaks and armor except Ser 
Jaime
Lannister
, the Kingslayer, who wears his famous gilded armor. The gigantic Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 thunders past like
an avalanche. Sansa also spies 
Yohn Royce
 and whispers to Jeyne that he wears bronze armor that is thousands of
years old, engraved in runes that protect the wearer. Septa Mordane points out Lord 
Jason Mallister
 in an eagle-
winged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor. The girls giggle at the warrior-priest 
Thoros of Myr
 until the septa
tells them he 
once
 scaled the walls of 
Pyke
 with a flaming sword. Although frightened by dark-skinned 
Jalabhar
Xho
, when Jeyne sees Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
 she states she is willing to marry immediately. The procession carries
on, with many knights whom Sansa does not know. To Sansa it is better than in the songs.
They watch the tourney from a place of honor. 
Jory Cassel
, in drab armor, wins two matches, but loses a well-fought
third match to the freerider 
Lothor Brune
 when King 
Robert
 judges Brune’s lance to have been steadier and better
placed. The other contestants from 
Winterfell
 do not fare as well. Sansa and Jeyne both scream sometimes when the
riders crash together. Sansa notes that Jeyne often covers her eyes when a rider falls, but knows how a great lady
must act, and draws the approval of Septa Mordane for her composure.
The jousting goes on all day and into the evening. Ser Jaime the Kingslayer rides brilliantly, defeating Ser 
Barristan
Selmy
, who has already unhorsed two men thirty and forty years younger than himself. 
The Hound
 and his immense
brother Ser 
Gregor Clegane
, the Mountain-that-Rides, seem unstoppable. On Ser Gregor’s second joust, his lance
rides up and impales Ser 
Hugh of the Vale
 in the neck, killing him. Ser Hugh, in his shiny new armor, falls not ten
feet from Sansa. Jeyne is so disturbed that she cannot stop crying, forcing Septa Mordane to take her away to regain
her composure, but she never returns. Sansa is astonished to find herself unmoved by the death, until she realizes
there will be no songs sung of Ser Hugh.
Lord 
Renly Baratheon
, a crowd favorite, is unhorsed so violently by the Hound that he seems to fly backwards and
the hard fall breaks a gold antler off his helm. Renly gives the broken antler to the Hound, who merely throws it into
the crowd, which erupts in a riot until Lord Renly restores order.
By the end of the day’s jousting, only four contestants remain: Ser Gregor Clegane, the Hound, Ser Jaime Lannister,
and Ser 
Loras Tyrell
. Sansa is entranced with Ser Loras, who is called the Knight of Flowers and has been giving
white roses to various ladies in the crowd throughout the day. Finally, Ser Loras gives a red rose to Sansa, telling
her, “No victory is half so beautiful as you.” Sansa is mesmerized for a long while until she notices Lord 
Petyr
Baelish
 above her. He tells Sansa that she has 
her mother
’s hair, touches her cheek, and leaves. The king announces
that the last three jousts will wait for the next day.

Later, at the feast, Prince 
Joffrey
 sits next to Sansa. He has not spoken to her and she has not dared speak to him
since the 
fight
 on the 
kingsroad
. Sansa remembers thinking at first that she hated Joffrey for 
Lady
’s death, but later
she rationalized that it is not Joffrey but Queen 
Cersei
 and 
Arya
 that are responsible. Now Joffrey is the soul of
courtesy, complimenting her by saying that Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty. Sansa asks if Ser Loras will win,
but Joffrey replies that either his uncle or his hound will defeat him, and that one day he will defeat them all. Joffrey
fills her cup with wine, which makes her look at Septa Mordane, but when Joffrey fills the septa’s cup also, Sansa
thanks him. He talks to her the rest of the night, making her laugh and helping her eat new foods like snails and trout
baked in clay. She can see that the arm 
Nymeria
 savaged is still bothering him, but he does not complain.
The king grows louder with each course. Finally, drunk as a man can be, he starts shouting at Queen Cersei, telling
her, “No! You do not tell me what to do, woman! I am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I
will fight tomorrow, I will fight!” Everyone stares, but no one interferes, and the queen storms off in silence. When
Jaime comes to him, the king pushes him away hard, causing Jaime to fall. The king boasts that he can still knock
Jaime in the dirt and that with his war hammer nobody can stand before him. Jaime replies stiffly, “As you say, your
grace.”
Joffrey then tells Sansa it grows late and asks if she needs an escort back. With Septa Mordane asleep at the table,
Joffrey calls to the Hound to take his betrothed back to her quarters, and deserts Sansa. The Hound asks Sansa if she
expected Joffrey to escort her back himself and scoffs at the idea. Sansa’s dreamy night has suddenly vanished. She
does not like the idea of the Hound taking her back to the apartments, but cannot wake Septa Mordane.
As the Hound escorts her back, Sansa cannot stand the sight of his burned face, despite insisting to herself that a true
lady would not notice. She compliments the Hound’s riding in the joust, giving him the knightly title “Ser.” He
responds angrily that he is no knight and that he spits on the vows knights take. He tells her that his brother is a
knight, and asks if he fulfills her naïve expectations. Sansa, lost for words, can only reply that no one could
withstand Ser Gregor. The Hound merely laughs that Sansa’s septa has taught her well: she is just a pretty little bird
reciting the words they taught her. When Sansa tells the Hound that he is frightening her, the scarred man only
continues his story, insisting that during the tourney his brother noticed Ser Hugh’s improperly fastened gorget and
purposely let his lance ride up to kill Ser Hugh.
The Hound then forces Sansa to look at his burned face. When she starts to cry, the Hound tells her how his brother
Gregor burned his face when he was six for stealing a toy knight. The toy had been nothing to Gregor, who was
already a six-foot-tall squire. He had lifted Sandor bodily up and pressed his face into a brazier. Four years later they
had anointed Gregor with the seven oils, and after his said his vows he was called 
Ser
 Gregor.
Sansa now feels sad for the Hound, and is no longer afraid of him. The silence goes on for a long while, and finally
she touches the Hound and assures him that his brother is no true knight. They travel the rest of the way in silence.
When he has finally delivered her to the corridor outside her bedchamber, Sansa thanks him. The Hound’s only
reply is a warning; keep the story about his face a secret or he will kill her.

After viewing the body of Ser 
Hugh
, 
Ned
 and Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 struggle to convince King 
Robert
 not to compete
in the melee. 
The Hound
 wins the 
tourney
 when he saves the life of the 
Knight of Flowers
. Later, 
Varys
 visits Ned
to reveal that Robert was meant to die in the melee.
Synopsis
Ned
 and Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 see that Ser 
Hugh
 is taken by the 
silent sisters
. Barristan Selmy explains that he stood
vigil for the fallen knight himself, as the boy had no one else except a mother far away in the 
Vale of Arryn
. Ser
Hugh had been Lord 
Jon Arryn
’s squire for four years and had been knighted by King 
Robert Baratheon
 after Jon
Arryn’s death. Ned wonders if the boy was killed on purpose by a 
Lannister
 bannerman to prevent Ned from
interviewing him.
Ser Hugh’s armor is new, forged especially for the tourney, and worth good money. Ser Barristan does not know if
Ser Hugh had even finished paying the smith. Ned replies that the boy paid dearly, and orders the silent sisters to
have the armor sent to the boy’s mother. Ser Barristan continues to walk with Ned and informs him that King 
Robert
intends to fight in the melee. Ned already knows. When Ser Barristan suggests that drunken words are often
forgotten in the morning, Ned insists that Robert will remember.
As they approach the king’s pavilion, they hear Robert raging at his squires, 
Tyrek
 and 
Lancel
. When they enter the
tent, Robert complains that his squires cannot even put a man’s armor on him properly, but Ned tells him the boys
are not at fault—Robert is too fat for his armor. Robert tells Ned in mock anger that he should not call his king fat,
and then sends the two squires off to get a breastplate stretcher from Ser 
Aron Santagar
. After the squires run out,
Robert and Ser Barristan laugh and even Ned smiles at the thought of the boys asking for the non-existent device.
Ned asks if the two squires are from 
House Lannister
. The king admits they are, and Ned notes to himself that there
are too many Lannisters around the king. Putting the thought aside, Ned asks about the angry words between the
king and his wife. Robert takes this opportunity to complain about 
Cersei
’s audacity in telling him he should not
participate in the melee, and he claims 
Lyanna Stark
 would not have done such a thing. Ned insists Robert did not
really know Lyanna, and that she would have told him he had no business fighting in the melee. This does not
dissuade Robert, who insists that—unlike Ned—he still has juices running in his veins. When Ser Barristan speaks
up to explain that no man would dare to strike a king during the melee, Robert is furious and sends Ser Barristan
away, but orders Ned to stay and to drink.
Robert laments to Ned that he was never so alive as when he was winning the throne or so dead as after it was won.
He declares that Ned or Jon Arryn should have been the king, but Ned reminds Robert that he had the best claim.
The king declares that he had not wanted to marry after Lyanna’s death and that it was 
Jon Arryn
 who recommended
Cersei Lannister. Robert admits that Cersei is beautiful, but insists that she is cold and that Jon Arryn was a fool for
recommending the marriage; Robert only agreed to it so he'd have the wealth and might of 
Tywin Lannister
 on his
side should 
Viserys Targaryen
 ever return to claim the throne.
Robert also apologizes to Ned for the death of Sansa’s 
direwolf
, admitting that he is sure 
Joffrey
 lied regarding the
incident
. He continues that he dreams of giving up the crown and becoming a 
sellsword
 in the 
Free Cities
, but the

thought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear stops him. Robert asks Ned how he could have
made a son like Joffrey. Ned responds hollowly that Joffrey is only a boy and that Jon Arryn often despaired of
Robert himself when he was a child. Robert admits this to be true and claims that he turned into a good king. When
Ned does not respond, Robert declares that Ned could at least say he is a better king than 
Aerys
. Ned admits the
truth in that. Robert insists that he and Ned still have many years yet to set things right and make him a good ruler.
Changing the subject, Robert asks who Ned believes will win the joust. Robert comments that the 
Knight of Flowers
is a son to be proud of and regales Ned with the story of when the young knight unhorsed 
Jaime Lannister
 in a
previous tourney. Then the king mentions that 
Renly
 has told him about the Knight of Flowers’ lovely, fourteen-
year-old sister 
Margaery
.
During breakfast, Robert talks with Ned about when they were boys. The stories bring a smile to Ned, who realizes
he is speaking to the Robert he grew up with and if he can prove his accusations this man will listen. The thought of
the downfall of Cersei and Jaime even makes the food taste better, and Ned feels better than he has in a long time.
Ned arrives at the tourney and sits by his daughter 
Sansa
. In the first joust, 
Littlefinger
 bets against 
the Hound
 since
a dog will not bite the hand that feeds it. He loses the bet when the Hound defeats Ser Jaime on the second pass after
almost losing in the first. Sansa tells Ned that she knew the Hound would win, and Littlefinger asks her to tell him
who will win the second match.
By the time they lead Ser Jaime—who can no longer see through his mangled helm—off the field, Ser 
Gregor
Clegane
 is in position. He is the biggest man Ned has ever seen, even dwarfing 
Hodor
. Ned recalls Gregor as a man
of ominous reputation; supposedly he dashed in the skull of the infant 
Aegon Targaryen
 and boasted that he raped
and murdered the boy’s mother Princess 
Elia
 afterwards. There are also rumors of queer circumstances surrounding
the deaths of two wives, a sister, his father, and the burning of his brother’s face.
Clegane’s opponent is the slim and elegantly armored Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell, who wears a cape of
woven flowers. After comparing Ser Loras and his opponent, Sansa asks her father to ensure that Ser Loras is not
hurt. Ned assures her that the lances are designed to break to prevent injury, but cannot help but think of Ser Hugh.
Ser Gregor has tremendous difficulty controlling his stallion, while Loras demonstrates his horsemanship on his
mare. When the pass begins, Clegane’s mount breaks into a hard gallop immediately, while Ser Loras’ mare charges
smoothly. They meet while Gregor is still struggling with his mount, shield, and lance. Ser Loras' lance strikes
Gregor perfectly, sending him down with his mount. Ser Loras’ lance is not even broken, and the crowd cheers
when he raises his visor in victory.
Gregor gets up in a rage, demands his sword, and nearly beheads his horse with a single blow. He then strides
toward Ser Loras and sends the Knight of Flowers to the ground with his first blow. He is about to deliver a killing
blow when the Hound intercedes. Gregor sends multiple sword blows toward his brother’s head, but the Hound
stops each one, remaining on the defensive. The Hound drops to his knee when he hears the King’s voice over the
crowd. The blow from Gregor passes through air, and finally Gregor comes to his senses, drops his sword, glares at
King Robert, and storms off. In gratitude, Ser Loras forfeits the championship to the Hound, so there is no final
joust. The crowd cheers for the Hound for the first time in his life.
As they head towards the archery field, Littlefinger points out that Ser Loras had to know his mare was in heat and
that such a thing would disrupt Ser Gregor’s stallion. A boy named 
Anguy
 wins the archery event, and Ned sends
Alyn
 to offer him a position among his guards, but the boy refuses. 
Thoros of Myr
, who fights with a flaming sword,
wins the melee that starts with nearly 40 men and lasts three hours. When the list of injuries is reported, Ned is
pleased that Robert did not take part.
That night at the feast, Ned remains more hopeful than he has been in a long while. Robert is in a good humor, the
Lannisters are nowhere in sight, and even his daughters are behaving. Sansa speaks to 
Arya
 pleasantly and even asks
how her dancing has gone. Arya happily explains that she is sore all over and shows a nasty bruise on her leg. Sansa
declares that Arya must be a terrible dancer.
Later, Ned examines Arya’s bruise himself while she stands on one leg, at which she has improved. He asks if 
Syrio
Forel
 is being too hard on her, but Arya replies that every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Ned is

concerned, even though Syrio came with an excellent reputation and the 
Braavosi
-style suits Arya’s slim blade. He
recalls finding Arya wandering the castle blindfolded because Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears, nose, and
skin. Arya has also been practicing spins and back-flips. Ned offers to have someone else take over her lessons, but
Arya insists she wants Syrio. Ned knows that any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the basics of sword
fighting without the blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping around on one leg, but he also knows there is no use
arguing with Arya.
Ned returns to his solar, thinking of what he has learned. He takes out the dagger and wonders why 
Tyrion
Lannister
, or anyone else, would want 
Bran
 dead. He is sure that Bran’s fall is somehow linked to the death of 
Jon
Arryn
, but the truth eludes him. 
Jory
 is still in the process of searching the whorehouses, and Ned is sure 
Gendry
 is a
bastard son of Robert. There is also 
Edric Storm
, a bastard Robert was forced to recognize because 
his mother
 was
highborn. He also remembers Robert’s 
first child
 from when Robert was still a boy himself. Yet no bastard can
threaten Robert’s trueborn children, since bastards have few inheritance rights.
A knock at the door brings a stranger, who turns out to be 
Varys
 in disguise. Ned is amazed; he has never seen
Varys wear anything but silk, velvet, and perfume yet now the eunuch wears coarse-spun clothes, mud-caked boots,
and smells of sweat. Ned exclaims that he would never have recognized Varys. The eunuch says this is good
because he would rather the queen’s spies not know about their meeting either.
Varys reveals to Ned that the Lannisters had hoped to kill Robert during the melee. When Ned asks why Cersei
would forbid Robert to compete if she planned to have him killed, Varys points out that the surest way to make
Robert compete would be to forbid it. Ned is furious that Varys did not tell him, but soon admits that he would have
gone straight to Robert, who would have fought to show his enemies he did not fear them.
Varys explains to Ned that there are two sorts of people in the 
Red Keep
: those loyal to the realm and those loyal to
only to themselves. Varys says he now knows Ned to be loyal to the realm because he dissuaded the king from
entering the melee. Varys also reveals that Cersei fears Ned because Robert will never harm him, not even at her
command, whereas Robert would execute Varys in a twinkling at queen’s request since the king has little love for
sneaks, spies, and eunuchs.
Ned argues that Robert must have other friends and that his brothers are surely loyal. Varys replies that hating the
queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing. Varys goes on to say that Ser Barristan loves his honor,
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger. Varys adds that the Kingsguard are a
paper shield: Ser 
Boros Blount
 and Ser 
Meryn Trant
 are the queen’s men, Ser Barristan is old, and the loyalties of
the rest are also suspect. Ned insists that they must warn Robert, but Varys reminds him that without proof they will
only lose. Ned insists that the plotters will try again, and Varys agrees, stating that together they might be able to
stop them.
As he rises to leave, Varys reminds Ned to continue treating him with his accustomed contempt. As Varys reaches
the door, Ned asks how Jon Arryn died. Varys tells him that a rare and costly poison called the 
Tears of Lys
 was
used. Varys goes on to say that he suggested a taster, but Lord Arryn refused. When Ned asks who administered the
poison, Varys claims that it was probably his squire, Ser 
Hugh
, who now lies dead. After 
Lysa
 left for the 
Eyrie
,
Hugh remained and had the money to buy new armor.
As a final question, Ned asks Varys what Jon Arryn had been doing that led to his murder. Varys replies, "Asking
questions."

Tyrion Lannister
 finds he is being taken to the 
Eyrie
 instead of 
Winterfell
, which will fool any attempt to rescue
him. His attempts to convince Lady 
Catelyn
 of his innocence are interrupted when the 
Vale mountain clans
 attack.
During the fight, Tyrion saves Catelyn and afterwards he explains that 
Littlefinger
’s accusation has a hole: Tyrion
would never bet against his 
family
.
Synopsis
As 
Tyrion
 watches the 
sellsword
 
Chiggen
 butcher his horse he chalks up another debt owed to the 
Starks
. The mare
was a gift from his brother 
Jaime
 for his twenty-third name day. The sellsword 
Bronn
 tells Tyrion that none of them
will go hungry, but Tyrion replies that he does not like eating horse, particularly his own horse. Bronn responds that
the 
Dothraki
 like horse better than other meats. Tyrion reflects that maybe his horse is the lucky one, since he has
many more cold hard days ahead of him. As he walks away from the sellswords, Tyrion thinks back bitterly to the
night at the 
inn
.
When they took him captive his guard 
Jyck
 had gone for his sword, but Tyrion had stopped him, knowing it would
only get them killed. Lady 
Catelyn
 showed the wounds on her hands all around, claiming they had been caused by
Tyrion's dagger during an attack on her son. All the people in the inn, who had been friendly enough before, started
screaming for his death. With only his men Jyck and 
Morrec
 to defend him, Tyrion had no choice but to surrender;
his other companion 
Yoren
, being of the 
Night's Watch
, was sworn to take no part in such matters.
Lady Catelyn stated, often and loudly, that they were taking Tyrion to 
Winterfell
 for justice. Tyrion had looked over
the crowd and seen that things were not as bad as they seemed. Of the roughly fifty men in the common room,
Catelyn Stark roused only a bare dozen. He announced that anyone who reported his capture to 
his father
 would get
a rich reward. Ser 
Rodrik
 then ordered the crowd to remain silent, and had Tyrion struggled not to laugh at the
thought that Ser Rodrik was fool enough to believe they would.
Lady Catelyn then asked for help in bringing Tyrion to Winterfell, and was rewarded with several recruits. As they
bundled him out of the inn he was not afraid, sure that they would never get him to Winterfell. Then they pulled a
hood over his eyes and made a hard gallop through the rain away from the inn.
It was dawn and the rain had stopped when they finally pulled the hood off and Tyrion saw they were on the 
high
road
 to the 
Eyrie
, not the 
kingsroad
 to Winterfell, and lost hope. Any pursuit would be looking in the wrong
direction and these were the lands of the late 
Jon Arryn
, and his wife 
Lysa
 was a 
Tully
. What was more galling than
the abduction was that Lady Catelyn had outwitted him.
He was spared the hood after that, and after the second night they no longer bound his hands. Still later, they hardly
bothered to guard him at all; there was nowhere for him to go. The terrain was harsh and wild and the road no more
than a stony track, and the mountains contained 
shadowcats
 and the dangerous 
Vale mountain clans
.
As they travel, Tyrion makes sure to remember the names of all his captors so that he can properly pay them back:
“A Lannister always pays his debt.” He has a particular enmity towards the singer 
Marillion
, whom he blames for
the whole mess, and who is currently looking for words that rhyme with “imp” for a song about this adventure.

Catelyn, Ser Rodrik, and several others are discussing their situation and the pursuit by the Lannisters when Tyrion
breaks in with the comment that there is small chance that the pursuit will catch them. 
Kurleket
 snaps that Catelyn
did not ask his views, but Catelyn allows him to speak. Tyrion explains any pursuit will be heading up the 
Neck
, not
towards the Eyrie. He states that they will find no help until they reach the 
Vale
, and that at their current pace they
will only lose more mounts, which burdens the others more. The pace could also very likely cause Tyrion’s death,
which Catelyn obviously does not desire. Catelyn replies that Starks are not murderers, and Tyrion states he is also
no murderer. He follows up by telling her that he is not stupid, and would not arm a common footpad with his own
blade.
For a moment, Tyrion can see doubt in Catelyn’s eyes, but she asks why 
Littlefinger
 would lie. Tyrion replies that
lying is in Littlefinger’s nature and mentions how the man often boasts of taking Catelyn’s maidenhood, which
Catelyn angrily denies. She calls Tyrion an evil man, but Tyrion calls her a fool, continuing on to say that
Littlefinger only loves Littlefinger and was only interested in sex with her. Kurleket puts a knife to Tyrion’s throat
and asks if he can bleed him, but Catelyn again tells him to let Tyrion talk. Tyrion asks how Littlefinger claims he
obtained the blade. Catelyn explains that he won the dagger from Littlefinger at the tourney where the 
Knight of
Flowers
 unhorsed his 
brother
.
The cry of a lookout interrupts them, alerting them to incoming riders, and Catelyn immediately arranges the
defense. Tyrion screams to Catelyn to arm him and his serving men, because she will need every man. Both he and
Catelyn know that the mountain clans—who are perfectly happy to slaughter each other—will slaughter Lannister
and Stark alike. 
Lharys
 slides down the ridge with the news that there are around 25 men: Milk Snakes or Moon
Brothers. Ser 
Willis Wode
 asks Marillion for help with his breastplate, but the singer freezes with fear. Instead,
Morrec springs to his assistance.
Tyrion pleads again with Catelyn, insisting that she cannot afford to waste men guarding them. At her request, he
gives his word that he will put down the weapons when the fight is finished, and she orders them armed. Morrec
arms himself with a bow, being better with it than a sword, and Bronn offers Tyrion a double-bladed axe. When
Tyrion comments on his inexperience with an axe, Bronn tells him to pretend he is splitting logs.
Tyrion joins Marillion in his hiding place. Marillion whines that he is a singer and wants no part of the fight, but
Tyrion forces his way in. The clansmen boil into sight, armed with a wide variety of weapons and led by a towering
man in a 
shadowskin
 cloak armed with a greatsword. The knights and sellswords meet the charge. As the others
shout “Winterfell” and “
Harrenhal
”, Tyrion has to repress an urge to stand up and shout "
Casterly Rock
”. From his
hiding spot, Tyrion sees Bronn charge through the clansmen, cutting through foes right and left, while Ser Rodrik
hammers the leader. Marillion shrieks when a rider leaps over them. When the rider turns, Tyrion charges and cuts
the horse’s neck so that the rider and his horse fall together on top of Marillion. Tyrion then buries his axe in the
man’s neck and uses this opportunity to crush Marillion’s fingers with a boot.
For the rest of the battle, Tyrion keeps on the fringes, leaping out to cut at the legs of horses and kill wounded men,
taking a helm from one. Tyrion watches Jyck get himself killed, then comes across Kurleket’s body and helps
himself to the man’s dagger. Then he hears a woman scream. Tyrion goes to aid Lady Catelyn even as he thinks that
he should let them have her. Tyrion gets the first man in the knee and Catelyn kills a second as he reels from a blow
by Tyrion. The third man makes a quick retreat, and the fighting is over.
As Bronn helps himself to Jyck’s boots, he asks if this is Tyrion's first fight, which Tyrion confirms. Bronn then tells
him that he needs a woman now; nothing like a woman after a man’s been bloodied. Glancing over to Lady Catelyn,
who is dressing Ser Rodrik’s wound, Tyrion quips that he is willing if she is.
Looking over the dead clansmen, Tyrion notes that they are thin, ragged men with unimpressive weapons. The
leader in the shadowskin cloak is not near as big or terrifying as he seemed now that the cloak is gone, and his great
sword turns out to be notched and poorly made. They have only three dead: the 
Bracken
 men-at-arms 
Mohor
 and
Kurleket, and Tyrion’s man Jyck. Tyrion remembers Jyck’s bareback charge and thinks of him as a fool to the end.
Ser Willis Wode urges that they must proceed in haste before more clansmen arrive, but Lady Catelyn wishes to
pause to bury the dead. When Ser Willis points out that the soil is too stony for graves Catelyn suggest they gather
stones for cairns. Bronn tells Catelyn that she can do as she likes, but that he and Chiggen have better things to do
than pile rocks, such as breathing. When Ser Rodrik agrees with Bronn, an angry Lady Catelyn agrees and they ride

on. Now there are plenty of horses. As Tyrion mounts Jyck’s horse, Lharys demands the dirk Tyrion took from
Kurleket’s body, but Catelyn intercedes, telling them to give him back his axe as well.
Tyrion is pleased to learn that Marillion the singer has broken several ribs, four fingers, and lost his harp. Tyrion is
less pleased to find Marillion has also acquired the magnificent shadowskin cloak. The singer, for once, has nothing
to say, and Tyrion can see him cringe when they hear shadowcats fighting over the bodies they left behind. He trots
up to the singer and taunts that “craven” rhymes nicely with “raven.” Then he moves up to ride next to Lady
Catelyn. Picking up the conversation from before their interruption, Tyrion points out that there is a serious flaw in
Littlefinger’s story: he 
never
 bets against his family.

Arya
 is chasing a cat when 
Myrcella
 and 
Tommen
 discover her. She escapes unidentified, but finds herself in the
dungeons. There she overhears two men talking about killing 
her father
. After eventually finding her way out she
tries to tell her father what she heard but he does not believe her.
Synopsis
Arya
 is chasing a one-eared 
black tomcat
 as part of her training with 
Syrio Forel
. Arya has found that catching cats
is hard; half-healed scratches cover her hands and her knees are scabbed from tumbles. At first, even the fat kitchen
cat could avoid her. As she stalks the black tom, Arya recalls when she originally went to Syrio with her hand
bleeding. He told her she was too slow and that her enemies would give her more than scratches. The castle is full of
cats, all of which she has caught and brought to Syrio, except for this one, which a 
gold cloak
 claimed was older
than sin and twice as mean; it had even snatched a quail from Lord 
Tywin
’s fingers once. Arya has chased the cat all
over the castle and she does not know where she is, but she has finally cornered the cat in a narrow alley.
The tomcat tries to dart between her legs, but Arya catches it. As she excitedly hugs the cat to her chest and gives it
a kiss, she is interrupted. Princess 
Myrcella
, at the end of the alley, asks what “that boy” is doing with that cat. With
her are a couple of the Lannister household guards, a septa, and Prince 
Tommen
. She asks again, and calls Arya a
ragged boy, which Tommen agrees with. Arya pauses a moment to look at her ragged clothing (you don’t wear silks
and skirts when catching cats). To avoid being recognized, Arya falls to one knee. The septa tells her that she does
not belong in this part of the castle. Arya is sure that as soon as she speaks the children will recognize her. The septa
tells the guards to bring Arya to her. Arya panics and escapes the grasp of the guard, runs over the prince, and avoids
the other guard. After a short chase, Arya sees a window above her, not much more that an arrow slit wide. She
leaps up, grabs the sill, and pulls herself through, holding her breath to get through.
Arya continues her rush, ending up lost in a dark cellar and thinking of the trouble she will be in if she was
recognized. After listening for a long time, she hears no pursuit. She remembers her nightmares of getting lost in the
Red Keep
, even though her father had told her it was smaller than 
Winterfell
. Arya plans to count to 10,000; by then
it will be safe to come out.
By the time she reaches 87, Arya can make out the large shapes of monsters all around her. Initially she is afraid, but
she soon overcomes her fear and makes her way over to touch one of the monsters. She can tell it is bone and that it
is dead, but has a feeling that it knows she is there and that it does not love her. She backs into a larger one and
whirls around, causing a tooth to rip her leather jerkin. She runs, avoiding a larger monster, and dashes through the
jaws of another to find a door. She opens it enough to slip through into the even darker hall beyond. She remembers
that a 
Water Dancer
 can see without eyes. As she proceeds down the hall by feeling the walls, Arya remembers that
all hallways lead somewhere. Then she hears noises and sees a dim flickering light, which allows her to see that she
is above a well with steps leading down.
Arya can see two men coming up the well and hears the echo of their voices, one of which is thick with the accent of
the 
Free Cities
. She quickly discovers that the men are talking about 
her father
 when one explains to the other that
the 
Hand
 will soon learn the truth. When the second man asks what the Hand will do with the truth, the first replies
that only the gods know, because the Hand is not a man to put aside the attempt on 
his son
’s life and that soon 
the

wolf
 and 
the lion
 will be at each other’s throats. The other man insists that a war now would do no good because
they are not ready.
As the men get nearer, Arya can see more of them. The one bearing the torch is fat with a scarred face and a stubble
beard who moves quietly despite wearing heavy boots and a steel cap. Arya finds him 
oddly familiar
 but cannot
recognize him. She is sure that she has never met the man with the accent. 
He
 has a forked beard and is grossly fat,
yet moves lightly like a Water Dancer.
When the torchbearer asks what he might possibly do to prevent a war, the fork-bearded man asks, “If 
one Hand
 can
die, why not a second?” The torchbearer insists that times have changed and that the current Hand is not like the
other. The fork-bearded man insists that they need more time: 
the princess
 is with child and the 
khal
 will not bestir
himself until his son is born.
The torchbearer insists that if the 
khal
 does not bestir himself soon it may be too late, because there are new players
in the game. 
Stannis Baratheon
 and 
Lysa Arryn
 are rumored to be marshalling their strength, Lord 
Renly
 and the
Knight of Flowers
 plan to make 
Margaery Tyrell
 King 
Robert
’s new queen, and no one knows what 
Littlefinger
 is
playing at. Yet the torchbearer insists that Eddard Stark worries him the most; he now has 
the book
 and 
the bastard
and soon the truth. 
His wife
 has also taken 
the Imp
 prisoner and 
Jaime
 and Lord 
Tywin
 will take this for an outrage.
The torchbearer claims that, even with his skill, he cannot keep control much longer, but does agree to do what he
can, saying he requires more gold and 50 more “birds.” The forked beard responds that 50 is a lot, given that they
are so young to know their letters. He suggests that if they could keep their tongues it would be easier, but the
torchbearer replies that the risk is too great.
Arya follows the two men for a long time, going deeper and deeper down the hall until dirt and timbers replace the
dressed stone. After miles of following, the men are gone and Arya, blind and lost, can see no way to go but
forward. At the end she is knee deep in stinking water, and eventually, she finds herself at the mouth of a sewer that
empties into the river. She is so dirty and stinky that she removes her clothes and swims until she feels clean. When
she looks around, Arya can see the Red Keep on its hill, miles away.
When she finally reaches the gate to the Red Keep and asks to be let in, the two gold cloaks on guard sneer at her
because she looks like a beggar. She tells them she is not a beggar, she lives there, and she wants to see her father.
One of the guards jokes that he wants to fuck the queen for all the good it does him. When Arya insists her father is
the Hand of the King, one of the guards tries to strike her, but she jumps away and insists she is Arya Stark and that
if they lay a hand on her their heads will end up on spikes. She offers that if they need proof of who she is 
Jory
Cassel
 or 
Vayon Poole
 can vouch for her. She finishes by asking the startled guardsmen if they will open the gate or
need a clap on the head to improve their hearing.
Arya is brought to her father in his solar by 
Tomard
 and 
Harwin
. He is bent over the biggest book Arya has ever
seen. As he hears the report, his face is stern. He then tells her that he had half his guard searching for her, and that
she is not supposed to go beyond the gates without his leave. She replies that she was in the dungeons, and they
turned into tunnels, she did not have a light, and she could not go back the way she came because of the monsters.
She then continues to say that two men were talking about killing him. They said that he had a book and a bastard,
and if one Hand could die, why not another. Ned is confused. Arya describes the two men, and that they said that the
wolf and lion would eat each other. Everything mixes up in Arya’s head. She tells her father that she thinks one was
a wizard. She decides not to mention knocking over the prince, and how she went into a window and found
monsters. Ned confirms that the men were talking about juggling and mummers, and tells her that they must be
mummers and that there must be a dozen troupes in 
King's Landing
 now. Arya tries to tell him that they were not
mummers, but he interrupts her, saying she should not be spying on people. Then he states he does not want his
daughter crawling through strange windows going after stray cats and notes all the scratches on her arms. He
continues by stating this has gone on long enough and that he wants a word with Syrio. The announcement of an
arrival from the 
Night's Watch
 interrupts their conversation.
Yoren
 is ushered in and Ned greets him pleasantly despite his being stooped, ugly, smelly, and in unwashed clothes.
Yoren apologizes for the hour, and states that Ayra has the look of Ned’s son. Arya replies that she is a girl, and then
asks about her brothers since she assumes Yoren must have come by way of 
Winterfell
, and if he can deliver a letter
to Jon, thinking Jon will believe her story of the men in the dungeon. Yoren explains to Ned that he is there to find

men for 
the Wall
, but he has other news, news that should be told in private. Ned tells 
Desmond
 to show Arya to her
room. She tries to confirm that nothing bad has happened to 
Jon
 or 
her uncle
, and Yoren tells her that Jon is fine.
As Desmond takes her to her room, Arya asks him how many guards her father has. He answers 50. Then Arya
wants assurance that they will not let anybody kill her father, so Desmond tells her that they guard him day and
night. Arya mentions that the Lannisters have many more men, and he answers that a northerner is worth 10
southerners. When she asks about wizards, he says a wizard dies the same as anyone else when you cut his head off.

Ned
 and King 
Robert
 argue over a plot to kill 
Daenerys Targaryen
. When the 
small council
 also sides against him,
Ned resigns in protest. As Ned prepares to return to 
Winterfell
, 
Littlefinger
 arrives with news that he has identified
the 
brothel
 that 
Jon Arryn
 and 
Stannis Baratheon
 visited.
Synopsis
Ned
 is trying to dissuade King 
Robert
 from sending men to kill 
Daenerys Targaryen
, now that 
Varys
 has received
reports of her pregnancy. Robert wants every 
Targaryen
 dead and grows very angry with Ned’s resistance. Ned
insists that even if the report is true a lot can happen before the child is old enough to be a threat; the mother might
miscarry, or the child might be born female or die in infancy. Ned also proclaims that he will only fear the 
Dothraki
when they teach their horses to run on water.
Renly
 comments that it was a mistake to allow 
Viserys
 and Daenerys to live this long. Ned insists that mercy is
never a mistake, pointing out that at the 
Battle of the Trident
 Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 slew a dozen friends of both Ned
and Robert, yet Robert absolved him and appointed him 
Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
. Robert insists that it is
not the same; Ser Barristan was a knight of the 
Kingsguard
. Ned counters that Daenerys is a 14-year-old girl and
asks why they overthrew 
House Targaryen
 if not to end the murder of children. Robert growls that it was to put an
end to Targaryens.
When Ned questions how a man who never feared 
Rhaegar Targaryen
 can tremble at the shadow of an unborn child,
King Robert bellows that he has heard enough and asks for a vote. The other councilors all side with the king except
for Ser Barristan who states that there is no honor in killing an enemy in his mother’s womb.
With the decision made, Robert turns to the topic of how best to carry out the assassination. Renly suggests that Ser
Jorah Mormont
, who craves a royal pardon, might be of use. Varys reminds them all that Ser Jorah is unlikely to risk
the punishment the Dothraki would inflict on the murderer of a 
khaleesi
. Instead, the eunuch proposes the alternative
of 
poison
, such as the 
Tears of Lys
; 
Khal
 
Drogo
 need never know it was not a natural death.
The mention of the Tears of Lys seems to awaken Grand 
Maester
 
Pycelle
 from his drowsiness and Robert
denounces poison as a coward’s weapon. Ned remarks on the hypocrisy of debating an honorable way to assassinate
a 14-year-old and declares that Robert should do the killing himself, the honorable way among the 
First Men
. Robert
is astounded when he realizes that Ned actually means what he has just said.
Ned refuses to participate further, declaring that Robert can do as he likes but that he will have no part of it. Robert
declares that, as 
Hand
, Ned will do as commanded or be replaced by a Hand who will. Ned wishes luck to his
replacement and removes his badge of office, declaring that he thought Robert was a better man. As Ned marches
away, the king calls after him that he will have Ned’s head on a spike if he ever sees him again. Before Ned has
even left, the council resumes the discussion and Ned overhears Pycelle telling the others of a society of assassins in
Braavos
 called the 
Faceless Men
. Littlefinger counters that they can hire an army of 
sellswords
 for a fraction of the
price.
Ned returns to the 
Tower of the Hand
 and summons 
Vayon Poole
 to discuss arrangements for their return to

Winterfell
. Ned is disturbed that Robert still hates the long dead Rhaegar Targaryen so much. Then Ned thinks about
what will happen when the king discovers that 
Catelyn
 has taken 
Tyrion Lannister
 captive. The king may not care
for the Imp, but it will hurt his pride, and 
Cersei
 will whisper in his ear. With these thoughts, Ned decides that it
might be safest if he and the girls go ahead, and the rest can follow.
After Poole leaves, Ned reflects that it will be wonderful to be back at Winterfell with his sons, but he remains angry
because the kingdom is in a crisis: Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers will beggar the realm, or sell it to
the Lannisters. Then there is the murder of 
Jon Arryn
. Ned considers taking a ship back to Winterfell, even though
he would prefer the 
kingsroad
, so that he can stop at 
Dragonstone
 and maybe learn the truth from 
Stannis Baratheon
.
The more he thinks about it, the more Ned guesses the truth is a secret he may not want to know. He looks again at
the assassin’s dagger and wonders if it has some connection to the mystery of Arryn’s death. Could Robert be part of
it? He remembers Catelyn telling him that he knew the man but the king is someone different. Ned summons Poole
back and tells him to find a fast ship with a good captain, quietly but quickly; if he could find a ship tomorrow, it
would be best to be on it.
Tomard
 announces the arrival of Littlefinger. Ned is tempted to send him away, but thinks better of it. Littlefinger
informs Ned that he has managed to convince the council to offer a lordship to any man who kills Daenerys rather
than hire the Faceless Men. When Ned criticizes the principle of giving titles to assassins, Littlefinger points out that
he actually did Daenerys more good than Ned did; if a 
Faceless Man
 were to be sent against the girl she would be as
good as buried, whereas this way some idiot will likely botch the job and put the Dothraki on their guard.
Ned is incredulous; Littlefinger supported the proposal but now expects him to believe that he was defending the
girl. Littlefinger then calls Ned an enormous fool who rules like a man dancing on rotten ice. Ned insists that he has
had his fill of politics. Littlefinger then says that if Ned is still in the city this evening he will take him to the 
brothel
his men have been searching for so ineffectually.

Catelyn
 and her party finally reach the 
Bloody Gate
 and safety. At her sister’s request, Catelyn makes the dangerous
night ascent to the 
Eyrie
 to meet 
Lysa
 and her sickly son, 
Robert
.
Synopsis
As they approach the 
Bloody Gate
, Ser 
Donnel Waynwood
 tells 
Catelyn
 that she should have sent word before
coming because the 
high road
 is no longer safe. Catelyn replies that they learned that to their sorrow, reflecting on
the six men who died to bring her this far; three in the 
first attack
, 
Lharys
 and 
Chiggen
 in the second, and 
Morrec
 of
a festering wound. Only Ser 
Rodrik
, 
Bronn
, 
Marillion
, Ser 
Willis Wode
, 
Tyrion Lannister
, and Catelyn herself
remain. They had been sure they were all doomed when Waynwood’s men approached.
Ser Donnel goes on to explain that since 
Jon Arryn
’s death the 
Vale mountain clans
 have grown bolder and Lady
Lysa
 has forbade sending men out to fight them, though no one is sure why. Catelyn chooses not to mention that it is
Lannisters
 her sister fears. Looking back at Tyrion, Catelyn notes the dwarf’s confidence in the presence of a large
party of men sworn to 
House Arryn
 and wonders again if she is wrong to suspect him. She is also unsettled by the
cunning of the man; although he remains her prisoner, the dwarf now rides freely, armed with a dirk and an axe and
wearing the 
shadowskin
 cloak he won gambling with Marillion.
Catelyn asks Ser Donnel to send for 
Maester
 
Colemon
 when they arrive to treat a badly injured Ser Rodrik. She is
told that her sister has forbidden the maester to leave the 
Eyrie
 because of her concern for her son 
Robert
’s health.
All that Ser Donnel can promise is the attention of a 
septon
 who tends to the garrison.
When they arrive at the Bloody Gate, they are met by Catelyn’s uncle, Ser 
Brynden Tully
, known as the Blackfish.
Once they have passed through the Gate, Catelyn can see the richness of the 
Vale of Arryn
 spread out before her and
the peak known as the 
Giant's Lance
 rising miles above the valley floor. Her uncle points out the faint glimmer of
the seven towers of the Eyrie on the side of the mountain and says that they can reach the foot of the Lance by
evening.
When Ser Rodrik declares that he cannot go any farther, Catelyn decides to leave the rest of her party behind.
Marillion the singer asks to accompany her to the castle. Catelyn, who cannot understand how Marillion survived
the journey which killed so many others, agrees. Then Bronn, whose ferocious fighting helped cut their path to
safety, declares that he is also coming. Catelyn dislikes the sellsword because of his lack of kindness and loyalty,
and would prefer to separate the sellsword from his fast friend Tyrion Lannister. However, Catelyn cannot politely
refuse after permitting Marillion to come and agrees.
As they travel, the Blackfish rides next to Catelyn. Catelyn recalls that her uncle was close to all the 
Tully
 children
and even 
Petyr Baelish
 when they were children despite a long feud with their father, Lord 
Hoster
. It had been in
defiance of Lord Hoster naming him the black goat of the Tully flock that Ser Brynden had taken a black version of
the Tully fish as his personal sigil. Catelyn recalls that the feud ended after the dual wedding of Catelyn and Lysa to
Eddard Stark
 and Jon Arryn, when the Blackfish left 
Riverrun
 to serve Jon Arryn in the Vale.
After Catelyn finishes explaining her story, her uncle says her father must be warned, since Riverrun is right in the

path of any Lannister attack. When Catelyn asks what the mood of the Vale is, he tells her that there is anger at the
suspicious death of the much-loved Lord Jon and the giving of the title of 
Warden of the East
 to 
Jaime Lannister
.
Lysa has instructed everyone to call young 
Robert Arryn
 the “True Warden of the East.”
The Blackfish also gives Catelyn the dire news that the young Lord Robert is unhealthy and cries when his dolls are
taken away, leading some to whisper that he is too weak for the seat. Some even suggest that 
Nestor Royce
, who
ruled as High Steward while Jon Arryn was serving as 
Hand of the King
, should rule until Robert comes of age.
Others believe that Lysa should remarry, but the Blackfish thinks she is just playing at courtship and intends to rule
herself.
When Catelyn states that a woman can rule as wisely as a man, the Blackfish replies that the right woman can, but
not Lysa. He explains that the death of her husband and the stillborn and miscarried children before that have left
Lysa unstable and hysterically protective of her only child. Above all, Lysa seems to fear the Lannisters and now
Catelyn has brought a Lannister to her doorstep. Catelyn insists that Tyrion is her prisoner. In reply, her uncle notes
that Tyrion is not only not in chains but also carrying weapons with a sellsword trailing him like a shadow. Catelyn
reminds him that Tyrion is not here by choice and that it was Lysa’s letter that started the whole business.
After passing through a valley surrounded by the high mountains, they reach the 
Gates of the Moon
. Well above the
gatehouse, Catelyn can see the looming mass of the mountain and high above the tower keeps of Stone, Snow, Sky,
and then the Eyrie. Tyrion jests that if they plan to make him climb the mountain at night they might as well just kill
him now. He is told that they will rest until morning.
When the dwarf asks how one gets up, he is told there are steps leading up the mountain and trained mules that go as
far as the way-castle called Sky. Beyond that the ascent is made on foot or in the winch baskets that bring up
supplies—the Eyrie is directly above Sky. Tyrion declines the offer of being sent up in a basket because his father
would not approve of him going up like a load of turnips if the others ascend on foot, claiming that Lannisters have a
certain pride. Catelyn responds that Lannisters have arrogance, avarice, and lust for power. Tyrion replies that his
father
 is the soul of avarice, Jaime has pride, and 
Cersei
 lusts for power, but he is innocent as a lamb and will bleat
for her.
The portcullis is raised and they are met by Lord Nestor Royce. Brynden asks for hospitality for the night, and is
told that Catelyn has been instructed to go up tonight, but the rest can have the hospitality of the castle. Brynden is
furious, considering night ascent to be too dangerous without a full moon. The guide 
Mya Stone
 then introduces
herself and promises that no harm will come to Catelyn, citing her experience on a hundred night ascents. Stone is
the surname of bastards in the Vale and that reminds Catelyn of 
Jon
. She is speechless, but Lord Nestor states that
Mya has never failed him, and so Catelyn agrees to the night ascent.
Mya Stone guides Catelyn up the long path to the Eyrie in the dark, claiming that torches only blind one on a clear
night. Mya then tells Catelyn that 
Mychel Redfort
, a squire she loves, says she has the eyes of an owl. Catelyn
knows that, because his family is highborn, the squire will never be allowed to marry a 
bastard
.
At each way-tower they switch to fresh mules. The trip to the first way-tower does not seem too bad, but the next
part is much steeper. At the next way-tower Mya explains that it is called Snow because, hundreds of years ago, this
was where the snow began. At first Catelyn thinks that, as a Tully and a Stark, there is little in the world to scare her.
However, when they must lead the mules across a high saddle between to spires of rock, Catelyn finds that she is too
scared to move. Mya comes back and escorts her, blind and trembling, step by step across. At Sky, Mya explains
that they must walk the last hour because the trail is more like a stone ladder. Catelyn states that, having travelled all
day and the best part of a night, she will ride with the turnips instead.
Catelyn finds the Eyrie, which can house 500 men, strangely empty. She is brought to her sister’s quarters. Lysa,
now a plump, pale, and (to Catelyn’s annoyance) well-rested woman, is polite until Ser 
Vardis Egen
 and Maester
Colemon depart. Then she rages at Catelyn for bringing Tyrion to the Eyrie, and thus dragging her into Catelyn’s
quarrel with the Lannisters. Catelyn replies that it was Lysa who sent her the letter naming the Lannisters as the
murderers of her husband. Lysa responds that it was a warning to avoid them, not fight them.
Roused by his mother’s voice, young Lord Robert appears in the door, grasping a doll. Lysa introduces Catelyn to
Robert and calls him a beautiful and strong child, warning Catelyn not to believe the stories. Lysa insists that on his

deathbed her husband said “the seed is strong” to let everyone know what a strong boy his son was. Catelyn attempts
to bring back the subject of preparing for war, but Lysa insists that Catelyn be quiet because such talk will scare
Robert. Lysa then exposes her breast and the six-year-old grabs for it and starts to suck.
The sight makes Catelyn think of her youngest son 
Rickon
, who is half this boy’s age and five times as fierce.
Catelyn continues to press Lysa to discuss preparations for war. Lysa replies that even if the Lannisters could bring
an army up, everyone says the Eyrie is impregnable. Catelyn realizes that her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her
about Lysa. Lysa then asks what she is supposed to do with Tyrion and Robert asks if he is a bad man. When Lysa
replies that he is, Robert says, “Make him fly.” Lysa strokes the boy’s hair and muses that perhaps that is just what
they will do.

 leads 
Ned
 to the 
brothel
 that 
Jon Arryn
 visited. There he talks to a young whore with a 
daughter
 that has
the look of King 
Robert
. As they are returning to the 
Red Keep
, Ned’s party is ambushed by 
Jaime Lannister
 and
about 20 of his men. In retribution for the 
abduction
 of 
his brother
, Jaime has Ned’s escort killed. Ned’s leg is
broken during the fight, and he loses consciousness.
Synopsis
Ned
 finds 
Littlefinger
 in the common room of the 
Chataya's brothel
 talking with an elegant 
black-skinned woman
.
His guardsman 
Heward
 is gambling for the removal of clothes with a whore while 
Jory Cassel
 watches from the
window. Ned declares his business done, and Jory moves to bring the horses around while Littlefinger makes a joke
about what part of the king’s anatomy the 
Hand of the King
 might be filling in for in a brothel. In no mood for
Littlefinger’s jokes, Ned gruffly declares he is no longer the Hand. Outside, it is raining as they mount up. As they
ride the deserted streets, Littlefinger tells Ned that he is considering buying the brothel because brothels make much
sounder investments than ships; they do not sink and pirates pay good coin like everyone else.
As they ride back toward the 
Red Keep
 in the rain, Ned remembers the night his sister 
Lyanna
 was betrothed to
Robert. Lyanna had told him that Robert would never keep to one bed. Ned, who had already held Robert’s first
bastard 
daughter
, assured her that Robert was a good man who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna responded
that one could not change a man’s nature. After what he has seen this night, Ned cannot say his sister was wrong.
Ned’s business at 
Chataya's brothel
 was to meet the prostitute with 
Robert
’s bastard daughter named 
Barra
. The
child resembled Robert, and the girl was proud to show him that the baby had the king’s nose and hair. Ned still
remembers that Robert’s firstborn had the same hair. The girl asked him to tell Robert how beautiful their daughter
is, that she has not been with anyone else, and that she is waiting for him. Eddard vowed that she and the child
would be well cared for. As he rides, Ned reflects that he is cursed to always keep his promises, while Robert can
swear undying love and forget it by the morning.
Ned thinks about 
Jon Snow
 and wonders why the gods give men such lust only to frown on bastards. Ned then asks
Littlefinger about Robert’s bastards. Littlefinger says he does not know exactly how many there are. He goes on to
speak in detail about Robert’s acknowledged bastard 
Edric Storm
, the son of a 
cousin
 to the king’s 
sister-in-law
.
Littlefinger also speaks of a rumored pair of twins of a serving maid at 
Casterly Rock
 which 
Cersei
 had killed. Ned
is surprised that Robert would stand by and let such a thing happen, but then recalls that Robert seems to have
grown adept at shutting his eyes.
Ned asks why 
Jon Arryn
 would suddenly take such an interest in Robert’s bastards. Littlefinger suggests that maybe
Robert asked him to. Ned declares that Jon Arryn was killed for something more than that. Littlefinger says
scornfully that maybe Lord Arryn had to be silenced for discovering Robert had bastard children, scoffing that next
the man might be audacious enough to claim the sun rises in the east. Ned thinks of 
Rhaegar Targaryen
 for the first
time in years, and wonders if the Dragon Prince frequented brothels; somehow he thinks not.
Suddenly they are surrounded by at least 20 
Lannister
 guardsmen. 
Jaime Lannister
 rides up and declares that he is
looking for 
his brother
 who apparently had 
some trouble
 on the road. Ned tells him that 
Catelyn
 took Tyrion

prisoner to answer for his crimes. This causes Littlefinger to groan in dismay and Jaime to move forward and draw
his sword. Jaime demands that Ned show his steel, declaring that he will butcher Ned but prefers it if Ned will fight
back. Jaime then suggests Littlefinger leave if he does not want blood on his expensive clothes. Littlefinger needs no
urging, but assures Ned that he will bring the 
City Watch
.
The Stark guardsmen have drawn their swords, but it is three against twenty, so Ned reminds Jaime that if he dies,
Catelyn will kill Tyrion. Jaime doesn’t believe him but is unwilling to chance it, so he tells his men not to harm Ned.
Yet Jaime refuses to leave Ned entirely unchastened so he orders Ned’s guardsmen killed. Ned and his men are
quickly overwhelmed and 
Heward
 and 
Wyl
 are cut down. Jory manages to break free, but returns almost
immediately and is killed. In the confusion, Ned’s horse slips and falls and Ned is blinded by the pain of his leg
breaking.
When he opens his eyes again, Ned drags himself through the mud. When Littlefinger and the gold cloaks finally
arrive they find him cradling Jory’s dead body. He is returned in horrid pain to the 
Tower of the Hand
, where Grand
Maester
 
Pycelle
 attends to his injury.

The

 enters

Daenerys
 discusses the pros and cons of Dothraki
combat skills with Ser 
Jorah Mormont
. Once they have settled in, Daenerys invites 
Viserys
 to sup with her and
makes a peace offering of new clothes. He becomes angry and grabs her. She hits him hard with a belt and tells him
to leave.
Synopsis
The 
khalasar
 enters 
Vaes Dothrak
 under the 
Mother of Mountains
 and proceeds along the godsway, passing under
the gigantic Horse Gate, a pair of rearing bronze stallions whose hooves meet a hundred feet up. 
Daenerys
 wonders
why Vaes Dothrak needs a gate when it appears to have no walls, no buildings, and no people. All that Daenerys can
see are ancient monuments that the 
Dothraki
 have sacked over the centuries in the grass on either side of the
godsway.
As she looks back at her brother 
Viserys
, who is now mounted again, Daenerys thinks back on the events of the long
ride east. After the 
incident
 on the 
Dothraki Sea
, Viserys had been forced to walk and the Dothraki had named him
Khal Rhae Mhar
, the “Sore Foot King.” Viserys did not realize that he was being mocked when he accepted a ride in
a cart from 
Khal
 
Drogo
, which earned him another name, 
Khal Rhaggat
, the “Cart King.” Daenerys had begged Ser
Jorah
 not to tell Viserys the truth, and only after much pleading had she convinced Drogo to allow Viserys to ride
again.
Now, as they ride past the broke idols of fallen cities, Viserys tells Daenerys that all the Dothraki savages can do is
steal things better men have built and kill, which is all he needs them for. He goes on to say the Dothraki cannot
speak the language of civilized men, and then states that he is tired of waiting for Drogo to give him his army. Ser
Jorah tells Viserys that Drogo will honor his promise in his own time. Fortunately, few of the Dothraki can
understand the Common Tongue. After Viserys leaves, Ser Jorah explains that the Dothraki are not merchants and
do not trade; despite what Viserys thinks, Khal Drogo considers Daenerys a gift and will eventually give a gift in
return.
Daenerys points out that it is not right to make her brother wait, and says Viserys believes he can sweep the 
Seven
Kingdoms
 with 10,000 Dothraki. Ser Jorah snorts that Viserys could not sweep a stable with 10,000 brooms.
Daenerys asks whether it would be possible for someone stronger than Viserys. Ser Jorah tells her that when he first
came to 
Essos
 he saw the Dothraki as half-naked barbarians and believed that a thousand good knights could put a
hundred times as many Dothraki to flight. Now he is not so sure; the Dothraki are better riders, their bows (wielded
from horseback) have a longer range, and there are so many of them. Drogo alone commands 40,000 men, the same
number that 
Rhaegar
 brought to the 
Battle of the Trident
, and only a tenth of Rhaegar's men were knights. When
Rhaegar died, many fled the field and such a rabble would not last long against 40,000 Dothraki. However, the
Dothraki have no patience for siegecraft and if the armies of 
Westeros
 stayed behind their castle walls they could
hold out forever. 
Robert Baratheon
 might be fool enough to give them battle, but the men around him are not:
Stannis Baratheon
, 
Tywin Lannister
, and 
Eddard Stark
. The way he says the last name leads Daenerys to ask if Ser
Jorah hates the man. Ser Jorah replies that Eddard Stark took everything he loved from him for a few lice-ridden
poachers and his precious honor.

They arrive at the city, which is both the largest and the smallest Daenerys has ever seen; it sprawls ancient,
arrogant, and empty across the plain. The buildings are all different. Ser Jorah explains that they are built by slaves
in the fashion they were familiar with. He also explains that the only permanent residents are the 
dosh khaleen
, the
widows of all the 
khals
 who have come before, yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house all the 
khalasars
 if they
should all return at once, as is prophesized.
When they near the eastern market and dismount, each rider gives up all his weapons to a waiting slave, for in Vaes
Dothrak no man may carry steel or spill blood. The palace of Khal Drogo is a massive feasting hall of roughhewn
logs that make a wall 40 feet tall with a roof of silk surrounded by horse yards and hundreds of earthen houses.
Daenerys is met by 
Cohollo
, one of Khal Drogo’s 
bloodriders
, who informs her that Drogo must ascend the Mother
of Mountains that night to sacrifice for his safe return. As she speaks to Cohollo, Daenerys recalls that the 
khal’s
three bloodriders are his sworn brothers who share everything with him except his horses. Daenerys is glad that
Drogo does not hold to the tradition of sharing 
her
 with his bloodriders because some of them frighten her.
Bloodriders are bound to their 
khal
 for life and die when he dies, living only long enough to avenge him if required.
Daenerys finds herself wishing 
her father
 was guarded by such men, remembering the stories of 
the Kingslayer
 who
murdered her father and Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 who went over to 
the Usurper
.
Daenerys, who is tiring easily as her child grows, is looking forward to a night of rest. She is led to one of the
hollow hills that has been prepared for her. She decides to give her brother his gifts tonight. She has prepared
Viserys several sets of clothes that she hopes will help him earn the respect of the Dothraki. She also intends the
gifts as a way of apologizing for shaming him. Daenerys orders 
Doreah
 to invite him to supper and 
Irri
 to go to the
market to buy something other than horse meat, which Viserys hates.
Viserys soon arrives, dragging Doreah by the arm, furious that Daenerys would presume to give him commands.
Daenerys attempts to explain that Doreah misspoke, then shows Viserys the clothes she has had made for him.
Viserys only sneers at the clothes, calling them Dothraki rags. Her brother goes on to ridicule her for presuming to
dress him and suggests spitefully that next Daenerys will want to braid his hair. Daenerys declares that he has no
right to a braid because he has won no victories.
Viserys grabs her by the arm, hurting her, and for a moment Daenerys is a scared little girl again. Then she grabs
hold of the first thing she touches, a medallion belt she meant to give Viserys, and swings it with all her strength.
The belt hits her brother full in the face and leaves a deep cut. Daenerys tells Viserys to leave and pray that Drogo
does not hear of this. Viserys leaves in a fury, telling her that when he comes into his 
kingdom
 she will regret this
day.

Bran VI
During his first ride outside 
Winterfell
 since his fall, 
Bran
 learns of 
Jaime Lannister
’s 
attack
 on 
his father
. 
Robb
goes ahead to find the 
direwolves
 and Bran is attacked by six outlaws. Robb returns with the direwolves and defeats
all but one. The last man holds a dagger to Bran’s throat until 
Theon
 kills him with an arrow from behind. 
Osha
, the
only survivor, is taken captive.
Synopsis
Bran
 is finally getting to ride outside of the castle in the oversize saddle that 
Tyrion Lannister
 designed for him. He
has been riding a horse he named 
Dancer
 in the yard for the past fortnight, getting bolder each time. With his legs
unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse makes him unsteady at first, but the straps around his chest and
thighs prevent him from falling. Soon Bran gets into the rhythm and his anxiety fades into a tremulous smile.
Bran would have preferred to have gone out with just 
Robb
, but neither 
Maester
 
Luwin
 nor the new Captain of
Guard, 
Hallis Mollen
, would allow it. The party includes Robb, 
Joseth
 the Master of Horse, 
Theon Greyjoy
, Maester
Luwin, and the 
direwolves
 
Summer
 and 
Grey Wind
. As they pass through the village, Theon calls out to two serving
wenches by the ale house. 
One
 blushes and Theon declares to Robb that she squirms like a weasel in bed but blushes
if you say anything to her in the street. Before Theon can continue his ribald story, Robb insists he not talk about
such things around Bran. Bran notes that Robb seems to admire Theon, but Bran has never warmed to him.
Bran asks to go faster, and Robb agrees and spurs his own horse. Bran brings Dancer to a gallop, and catches up to
Robb at the edge of the 
wolfswood
. Bran exclaims his excitement at being able to ride, and Robb smiles, but Bran
can tell something is bothering his brother. Robb notes that something is bothering the direwolves as well before
admitting there was a raven the night before. The news recently from the ravens has not been good: 
Uncle Benjen
has still not been found and 
their mother
 has taken 
Tyrion Lannister
 captive. Bran remembers Robb sending riders
with commands throughout the north. Nobody had told him what was happening, but Bran knew it was about the
Lannisters
 and not good. There is something about the Lannisters that Bran knows he ought to remember, but when
he tries to think what it is he becomes dizzy and his stomach clenches.
Robb explains that the message was from 
Alyn
 in 
King's Landing
. 
Heward
, 
Wyl
, and 
Jory Cassel
 have been
murdered
 by the 
Kingslayer
. Bran cannot understand why anyone would kill Jory, whom he remembers chasing him
across the roofs of 
Winterfell
. Robb continues solemnly that their 
father
’s leg was shattered in the fight and he has
not woken since. Robb promises Bran that he “will not let this be forgotten.” Theon advises Robb to call the
banners. Bran exclaims that only the Lord can call the banners, but Theon replies that if Eddard dies, Robb is Lord
of Winterfell. Robb notes to Bran that the honor of 
the North
 is in his hands. Bran asks if Maester Luwin agrees with
calling the banners, and Theon calls the maester as timid as an old woman. Bran tells Robb that their father and
mother both listen to the maester’s council; Robb states that he listens to everyone.
The joy of the ride is over and Bran asks if they can go back because he is cold. Robb states that first they need to
find the wolves and the brothers ride into the wolfswood while Theon falls back to talk with a guardsman. Bran
enjoys riding his horse in the woods while Theon and the guardsmen fall further behind. When they come to a
stream, Robb asks Bran what is troubling him. Bran admits that he remembers Jory bringing them here to fish with
Jon Snow
. Bran asks if they will ever see Jon again and Robb reminds him that even Uncle 
Benjen
 came to visit.

Then the wolves howl and Robb rides off to get them, asking Bran to stay there.
Bran is getting anxious about the others when four ragged men and two women surround him. Bran can tell they are
neither foresters nor farmers and suddenly he remembers how richly he is dressed. The biggest man asks if he is lost
and Bran says that his guard will be along shortly. Bran, seeing their clothes, believes that the rags could be the
black of the 
Night's Watch
; he remembers that his father said deserters are dangerous because they know their life is
forfeit.
The outlaws demand his silver pin and his horse. When Bran tries to explain that he cannot dismount, they do not
believe him. The big man, whom the others call 
Stiv
, grabs the reins before Bran thinks of turning and riding off.
Finally, the tall woman, 
Osha
, sees the straps. The short woman named 
Hali
 asks if he is a cripple. Angered, Bran
declares that he is Brandon Stark and that they had better let go of his horse or they will be dead. With Bran’s
arrogant outburst, the gaunt man named 
Wallen
 proclaims that only a Stark would threaten when a smarter man
would beg. Hali tells the others to cut off his cock and stuff it in his mouth. Osha tells Hali that she is as stupid as
she is ugly; 
Mance Rayder
 will pay well for a kinsman of 
Benjen Stark
. Stiv states that he does not want to go back
to the 
White Walkers
, and cuts the strap on Bran’s saddle, cutting Bran’s leg in the process. Bran feels nothing, but
starts to feel light headed.
Suddenly Robb calls out for them to surrender. Bran sees that Robb is still mounted, with the body of an elk over the
back of his horse. The outlaws only laugh and point out that it is Robb who is outnumbered and should surrender.
Then the direwolves appear at Robb’s whistle. Robb charges, killing one of the men and riding down Osha when she
overextends with her spear. At the same time 
Grey Wind
 kills Wallen and the other unnamed man while Summer
tears open Hali’s belly.
Now facing Robb and the direwolves alone, Stiv finishes cutting Bran free, hauls him from the saddle, and holds his
knife to Bran’s throat. Stiv tells Robb to drop his sword and Robb slowly complies. Then Stiv tells Robb to call the
direwolves off, which Robb does. Bran can see that Osha is still alive. Stiv commands Osha to kill the wolves, but
she refuses to go anywhere near them. Instead, Stiv orders Robb to kill the wolves. Bran screams “No,” knowing
that they will be defenseless without the wolves. Suddenly an arrow from Theon Greyjoy’s bow bursts through
Stiv’s chest and the man collapses into the stream.
The Stark guardsmen appear and Osha throws down her spear and surrenders. The guardsmen grow pale and some
even vomit when they see the carnage. Theon, ever smiling, is proud of his shot, but Robb scolds him for taking
such a chance with Bran’s life; he might have missed or the knife could have slipped. Then Robb turns on the
guardsmen, asking where they were. They explain that at first they were waiting for Maester Luwin and Theon
admits he lead them off to hunt a turkey. Robb is angrier than Bran has ever seen him.
As Maester Luwin examines Bran’s wounds he points out to Robb that two of the attackers wear the black of the
Night's Watch. Robb orders their heads cut off for transport back to 
the Wall
, but orders the bodies left unburied.
The question of what to do with Osha comes up. The woman drops to her knees to beg Robb to spare her,
proclaiming that she will serve him. When Robb asks what use he might have for an oath-breaker, Osha insists that,
as a 
wildling
, she broke no oaths. Theon suggests that they give her to the wolves, which causes Osha to shudder
and even some guardsmen to look queasy. Maester Luwin advises that they question her, so Robb orders her bound
and brought back to Winterfell.

Tyrion
 is held captive in one of the 
Eyrie
’s 
sky cells
. Eventually he bribes the 
jailer
 to take a message that he is
ready to confess. When brought into the high hall, Tyrion manages to convince Lady 
Lysa Arryn
 to give him a trial
by combat and the sellsword 
Bronn
 declares he will be Tyrion’s champion.
Synopsis
The ugly and sadistic jailer 
Mord
 brings beans for 
Tyrion
, who is in one of the 
Eyrie
’s 
sky cells
. As always, when
Tyrion reaches for the plate, the oaf pulls it away and holds it over the edge of the cell, telling Tyrion to come get it.
Tyrion is unwilling to step that close to the edge and Mord lets the plate fall. Tyrion curses Mord, who gives him a
kick before he leaves.
Tyrion crawls to the corner to huddle under a thin blanket that has replaced the 
shadowskin
 cloak stolen by Mord.
Tyrion reflects that he would gladly trade the cold and open sky cell for the dankest pit in 
Casterly Rock
. When
Mord placed Tyrion in the cell he promised that, sooner or later, Tyrion would fly. To make things worse, the floor
slants towards the opening, making Tyrion afraid to sleep, lest he slip towards the edge.
Tyrion remembers when 
Lysa Arryn
 announced to her court that Tyrion had slain 
Jon Arryn
, the 
Hand of the King
.
That was when Tyrion put his foot in it, remarking “Oh, did I kill him too.” He went on to wonder aloud when he
would have had enough time to do all this killing. He should have been silent but he had been in a foul mood, having
been humiliated by having to be carried the last leg of the climb to the Eyrie by 
Bronn
. Lysa warned him about
where he was but he threatened them with the wrath of 
Jaime Lannister
 all the same. He even declared his threat a
promise and drove sickly young Lord 
Robert Arryn
 into a frenzy. It was only the intervention of 
Catelyn Stark
 that
saved him from being made to fly when she insisted that Tyrion was her prisoner. Then he was sent to the sky cells.
Tyrion thought that they would not dare kill him out of hand, but now he is not so sure. He is getting weaker every
day and it is only a matter of time before Mord’s kicks do him serious harm. He is sure that 
his father
 will have sent
riders out by now and Jaime might already be leading an army to rescue him. 
Cersei
 might get King 
Robert
 to sit in
judgment himself, which even 
Eddard Stark
 could not object to. Tyrion is sure he can win a trial since the 
Starks
have no proof.
Tyrion wonders which of his siblings sent the footpad to kill 
Bran Stark
 and if they also conspired in the death of
Jon Arryn
. If Arryn was murdered it was subtly done, whereas sending a footpad to kill Bran was unbelievably
clumsy. This leads Tyrion to wonder if there is some other force involved that has made him a pawn; Tyrion hates
being a pawn.
Tyrion decides that he must free himself, and soon. He has no chance of overpowering Mord, so he must talk
himself out. Tyrion hammers on the door, yelling for Mord. Mord is furious that Tyrion is making noise. Tyrion,
remembering not to show fear, asks if Mord would like to be rich. Mord only strikes him with a leather strap. It
takes a great deal of talking about 
Lannister
 gold while getting slapped before Mord finally starts to listen. Tyrion
explains that, although she relieved him of his purse, Catelyn Stark would never rob him; therefore the gold is still
his. Tyrion promises all of his gold to Mord in exchange for Mord telling Lysa Arryn that he wishes to confess his
crimes. Tyrion even goes so far as to lie that his brother 
Jaime
 wears solid gold plate armor (it is actually gilded

steel, but Mord would never know the difference}. When Tyrion senses Mord’s suspicion, he offers to write down
the deal and Mord brings him a pen and paper.
Tyrion is shivering in his sleep when Ser 
Vardis Egen
 arrives to bring him to Lysa. Before he leaves, Tyrion asks
Mord for his shadowskin cloak and Ser Vardis orders the unhappy jailer to hand it over. The High Hall is filled with
knights and retainers to hear his confessions. Tyrion is happy to see that young Lord Robert is missing from the high
throne. Tyrion is also pleased to see 
Bronn
 and 
Marillion
 among the witnesses; with a singer present, whatever
happens will not remain a secret.
Lysa comments to her sister that the sky cells always break prisoners, but Catelyn only says that Tyrion does not
appear broken to her. Tyrion declares to himself that the time has come to roll the dice. He starts by declaring
himself a vile little man and that his crimes and sins are beyond counting: whoring, gambling, wishing his own
father and sister dead, and speaking ill of the royal court. Soon he is interrupted by a furious Lysa and Catelyn tells
him pointedly that he is there to confess to the attempted murder of 
Bran Stark
 and the murder of Jon Arryn. Tyrion
merely replies that he cannot confess to those crimes because he is innocent.
Lysa orders Tyrion taken back to a smaller sky cell with a steeper floor. Before he can be taken, Tyrion asks loudly
if this is how justice is done in the 
Vale
: he is accused of crimes, he denies them, and so he is thrown into a cell. He
makes sure to show his bruised face to the crowd. Tyrion demands a trial where he can defend himself and be
judged by gods and men. Lysa states that if Tyrion is found guilty, he will go through the “moon door”, which leads
only to a fatal plunge to the mountainside below. Catelyn tells Lysa that this is unwise. Lysa states that her son will
hear and judge Tyrion’s trial. Tyrion remembers Lord Robert stating that he wanted to see him fly.
Tyrion demands a trial-by-combat, which the fills the hall with derisive laughter. There are shouts throughout the
hall, with most men asking to be given the honor of championing Lysa Arryn’s cause. Lysa declares that Ser Vardis
Egen, the only silent man, will be her champion. Ser Vardis sinks to one knee, but declines the honor, insisting that
to slaughter such a defenseless man would be shameful. Tyrion is quick to agree, demanding a champion the same
as Lysa and naming his brother 
Jaime
. When Lysa refuses Tyrion’s choice on the grounds that Jaime is hundreds of
leagues away, Tyrion turns to Marillion to insist that when he makes a ballad of these proceedings he be sure to
mention that Tyrion was denied a champion and sent bruised and hobbling against Lysa’s finest knight. Lysa tells
him to name another champion. For a moment no one moves and Tyrion wonders if he has made a terrible mistake.
Then there is a stirring in the back of the chamber, and Bronn calls out that he will stand as champion for Tyrion.

 dreams of the

 at the

. When he wakes he finds King 
Robert
 angry about the abduction
of 
Tyrion Lannister
, demanding that Ned make peace with the 
Lannisters
. Robert reinstates Ned as 
Hand of the King
and declares that Ned must sit the 
Iron Throne
 because he is going hunting.
Synopsis
Under the influence of the 
milk of the poppy
, 
Ned
 dreams an old dream of the 
showdown
 at the 
Tower of Joy
. In the
dream as it was in life, his friends ride with him: 
Howland Reed
, Lord 
Willam Dustin
, 
Ethan Glover
, 
Martyn Cassel
,
Theo Wull
, and Ser 
Mark Ryswell
. They were seven facing three, but these three were men of the 
Kingsguard
 and
living legends: 
Lord Commander
 Ser 
Gerold Hightower
, Ser 
Arthur Dayne
 the 
Sword of the Morning
, and Ser
Oswell Whent
. Ned had looked for them on the 
Trident
, and at the 
Sack of King's Landing
, and at the 
Siege of
Storm's End
, but found them guarding this tower near the 
Red Mountains
 of 
Dorne
. In spite of Rhaegar’s death, they
refused to bend the knee. By the end, only Ned and Howland Reed remain alive. Ned is awoken from the dream in
the midst of making a promise to his dying sister 
Lyanna
 after the battle.
Vayon Poole
 is calling and this wakes Ned. He is informed that it has been six days and King 
Robert
 has
commanded that Ned attend him when he wakes. Ned replies that he is too weak, but that he would be pleased to
receive the king in his room. When Ned asks for his captain of the guard (remembering that 
Jory
 is dead), 
Alyn
appears. He tells Ned that 
Jaime Lannister
 has left 
King's Landing
, that extra guards have been put on, that his
daughters have been with him every day, and that Jory, 
Heward
, and 
Wyl
 have been given to the 
silent sisters
 to be
sent north to 
Winterfell
. Ned remembers that Jory’s father, Martyn Cassel—who was one of his seven at the Tower
of Joy—was buried in the 
Dornish Marches
 with the others. That takes Ned back to his dream. He does not think it
bodes well for him to dream that dream now. It is then that Poole announces the arrival of both Robert and 
Cersei
.
Ned does not think it bodes well that Cersei has come, either. Ned orders that they be sent in, and that the others
leave, as what is to be said should be kept secret.
When Robert asks if Ned knows what his wife has done, Ned states that 
Catelyn
 is blameless since she took action
on his behalf and under his authority as 
Hand of the King
. The king tells Ned he is unhappy: the King’s Hand is
supposed to keep the peace, but seven men are dead. Cersei corrects this to eight, as a Lannister 
guardsman
 recently
died of his wounds. Robert declares that he will not tolerate it and demands that Ned command 
Tyrion Lannister
’s
release and make peace with Jaime. Ned angrily replies that three of his men were butchered in front of his eyes
because Jaime wished to chastise him.
Cersei leaps to Jaime’s defense, accusing Ned and his men of attacking Jaime while returning drunk from a brothel.
Ned calmly reminds Robert that he should know him better than that, and that 
Littlefinger
 will confirm his story.
Robert replies that Littlefinger only said they had been returning from a brothel. Ned angrily informs Robert that he
was at the brothel to visit Robert’s 
bastard daughter
. When Robert criticizes the girl’s choice of name Ned has a hard
time keeping his temper as he demands to know how one could expect a 15-year-old whore to have better sense. He
then tells Robert that the girl is in love with him.
Ned asks for Robert’s leave to bring Jaime back to face justice. Robert tells him to leave it alone and make peace
with Jaime. Ned declares that if that is Robert’s notion of justice he is pleased he is no longer his Hand. Cersei

declares, "If any man had dared speak to a 
Targaryen
 as he had spoken to you—" but Robert cuts her off by asking
angrily if she mistook him for 
Aerys
. Cersei presses on regardless, telling Robert that she took him for a king, that
Jaime and Tyrion are his brothers by marriage, and that Ned dishonors them all by driving off one brother and
abducting the other. She steps too far, however, when she declares that Robert should be the one in skirts and her in
armor. Robert’s face goes purple with rage and he lashes out with a blow to Cersei’s face that knocks her to the
floor. Cersei remarks that she will wear the bruise as a badge of honor before she is escorted out by Ser 
Meryn
Trant
.
Robert, in misery, asks Ned if he sees what Cersei does to him. He continues that he should not have hit her, but
says he does not know how to fight someone you cannot hit. Robert then declares that 
Rhaegar
 won: Rhaegar has
Lyanna and he has Cersei. Ned tells Robert that they need to talk, but Robert is sick of talk and intends to hunt on
the morrow; whatever Ned wants to tell him can wait until he returns. When Ned reminds Robert that by then he
will have departed for 
Winterfell
 as commanded, Robert throws the 
Hand
’s badge of office onto the bed and forbids
Ned to leave. Ned asks about 
Daenerys Targaryen
 and is told that is done. Ned continues by asking why Robert
wants him as Hand if he will not listen to his advice. Robert states that somebody has to run the kingdom. As he
leaves, Robert swears that if Ned resigns again, he will pin the badge on Jaime Lannister.

Catelyn
 gets news from 
Riverrun
 that 
House Lannister
 is gathering an army at 
Casterly Rock
. As Catelyn and Ser
Rodrik
 arrive for 
Tyrion
's trial-by-combat they meet Ser 
Brynden
, who has resigned his post and plans to join the
defense of 
Riverrun
. In the duel, 
Bronn
 kills Ser 
Vardis Egen
 and Lysa sets Bronn and Tyrion free outside the
Bloody Gate
 to take their chances with the 
Vale mountain clans
.
Synopsis
Catelyn
 watches dawn break over the 
Eyrie
. Below is the waterfall called 
Alyssa's Tears
, named after 
a woman
 who
had seen her husband, brothers, and all her children slain but never shed a tear. Catelyn wonders how large a
waterfall her own tears will make when she dies.
She asks and Ser 
Rodrik
 continues with his news. Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 is gathering an army at 
Casterly Rock
.
Catelyn’s brother 
Edmure
 writes that he has commanded Lords 
Vance
 and 
Piper
 to guard the pass below the 
Golden
Tooth
. Edmure’s letter goes on to declare that he will yield no foot of 
Tully
 land without soaking it in 
Lannister
blood. Catelyn is in a foul mood and asks why the letter makes no mention of 
their father
, the lord of 
Riverrun
, who
must be very sick to give the defense over to Edmure.
When Catelyn says that she should have been woken immediately when the letter arrived, Ser Rodrik explains that
Lysa
 thought it was better to let her sleep. He also mentions that her sister plans to speak with her after the combat.
Catelyn declares the combat a 
mummer
’s farce, angry that Lysa cannot see 
Tyrion Lannister
 has tricked her. In
Catelyn’s opinion it is past time that she and Ser Rodrik leave for 
Winterfell
, planning to take a ship north from
Gulltown
. Ser Rodrik pales at the thought of another sea voyage.
As the servants dress her, Catelyn hopes that she can talk to her sister before the duel. The shy girl Catelyn knew at
Riverrun has grown into a vain and inconstant woman. When the message came that Tyrion wanted to confess,
Catelyn had tried to convince Lysa to talk to the dwarf in private, but her sister insisted on a public show.
As they come to the doors of Lysa’s apartment, Ser 
Brynden
 the Blackfish is coming out. He is angry that Lysa has
refused to grant him a thousand men to aid the defense of the 
riverlands
. He declares that he has resigned as Knight
of the 
Bloody Gate
 and will go alone. Concerned about her uncle travelling the 
high road
 alone, Catelyn suggests he
return to Winterfell with them and receive his thousand men from her. Ser Brynden agrees and Catelyn and Ser
Rodrik enter Lysa’s apartment.
Lysa’s apartments overlook a grassy area scattered with statues (the remnants of a failed attempt to plant a
godswood
) where the duel will take place. An elegant looking Lysa is holding court on the terrace, surrounded by
her many suitors. The young Lord 
Robert
 is in a chair on an elevated platform being entertained by a puppeteer.
Catelyn attempts to explain to Lysa that they have nothing to gain by executing 
Tyrion Lannister
 and everything to
lose if his champion should succeed. Lysa and her suitors insist that any knight is superior to a common 
sellsword
like Bronn. Having seen 
Bronn
 fight on the high road, Catelyn is much less certain. Trying another approach,
Catelyn argues that the Lannisters (especially 
Jaime Lannister
) will not be satisfied that they had a trial before
executing Tyrion. 
Lyn Corbray
 insists that Tyrion’s head will serve as a warning to the Lannisters, but Lysa insists

that her son wants to see Tyrion fly as if it settles the matter. Catelyn attempts one final time to stop the trial by
claiming Tyrion is 
her
 prisoner. Lysa merely rants that Tyrion killed her husband and she means to see him pay.
Ser Rodrik asks Catelyn quietly if she truly thinks Tyrion did it. She states that she believes the Lannisters murdered
Jon Arryn
, but she cannot say whether it was 
Cersei
, Jaime, or Tyrion; Lysa named Cersei in her letter, but now she
seems certain it was Tyrion, perhaps because she has Tyrion as her captive. Ser Rodrik agrees that poison could be
the work of Tyrion or Cersei, but Jaime is too fond of blood to have used poison. Catelyn wonders how else they
could have made it look a natural death.
When Catelyn hears her nephew shriek in delight at the antics of the puppets, she states that the boy is too
undisciplined; he will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from Lysa. 
Maester
 
Colemon
, having
overheard this, pipes in that Jon Arryn agreed and was planning to send the boy to 
Dragonstone
. Catelyn corrects
him that it was 
Casterly Rock
, but the maester insists it was Dragonstone.
Tyrion Lannister is led forward and Robert asks if he can make him fly. Then the two champions appear from either
side of the garden. Ser 
Vardis Egen
 is armored in plate from head to toe with a narrow slit for vision. Bronn looks
almost naked by comparison, wearing only a half helm, a mail coif, and ringmail over boiled leather. However,
Catelyn notices that Bronn is 15 years younger and half a hand taller, with a greater reach than Ser Vardis,
The 
septon
 calls upon the gods before making a hasty departure. Robert is impatient for the fight to start. The
knight’s heavy kite shield is strapped to his arm by a squire. When offered a shield, Bronn refuses. The knight is
handed an elegant double-edged sword that Lysa announces belonged to Jon Arryn for ceremonial occasions. Lysa
explains that she thinks it is only fitting that Ser Vardis avenge Lord Arryn with his own blade, but Catelyn notices
that Ser Vardis shows some discomfort with the strange sword. Finally, Robert is allowed to initiate the fight. After
an initial probing exchange, Bronn starts to leap away from the knight’s advances. The crowd starts declaring that
Bronn is craven, but Ser Rodrik tells Catelyn that Bronn is trying to tire the knight.
As she watches the fight, Catelyn remembers the duel between 
Brandon Stark
 and 
Petyr Baelish
. When Brandon
saw the limited armor Petyr was wearing, he took off most of his own armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor, but
her father had promised her to Brandon. As she had given the favor to Brandon, Catelyn had begged him to not kill
Petyr and he had agreed. The fight was ended quickly with a deep cut to Petyr’s ribs, which Catelyn was sure was
fatal. That was the last time she had seen Petyr 
until King’s Landing
.
When Catelyn returns her attention to the fight she can tell Bronn is quicker. Robert complains that the combatants
are not fighting properly, but his mother assures him that the 
sellsword
 cannot run all day. Eventually Ser Vardis is
addled by a fall, and loses sight of Bronn because of his narrow visor. Bronn uses this opportunity to place a serious
blow to the knight’s elbow. Now the knight’s parries begin to grow slower and lower and Bronn attacks with more
energy. Blind to the fact that Ser Vardis is losing, Lysa calls for him to finish the sellsword as if he were delaying
the end on purpose. The knight charges and Bronn almost loses his balance but manages to jump back from the blow
and push a statue onto the knight. With Ser Vardis pinned under the fallen statue, Bronn delivers the killing blow
and a silence falls over the crowd.
Robert asks if it is over, and Lysa is forced to admit it is. Robert then asks if he can make the little man fly and
Tyrion joyfully says, “Not this little man.” When Lysa makes a thinly veiled threat to execute Tyrion anyway, the
dwarf asks if Lysa remembers 
House Arryn
’s words: “As High as Honor.” Robert insists that he wants to make
Tyrion fly, but Lysa is forced to admit that the gods have proclaimed Tyrion innocent. She orders Tyrion and Bronn
escorted to the 
Bloody Gate
 and provided with supplies, but they must take the high road alone. Everyone in the
court recognizes the proclamation as another sort of death sentence. Tyrion favors Lysa with a mocking bow, saying
he and Bronn already know the way.

Jon VI
Ser 
Alliser
 announces that he is passing eight recruits, including 
Jon
. There is a celebration, but Jon realizes that
Sam
 will not survive without the others to protect him. Jon asks 
Maester
 
Aemon
 to allow Sam to become his
steward since he can read, write, and do sums.
Synopsis
Five new recruits are being marched up the 
kingsroad
, so Ser 
Alliser
 is passing eight boys on to the 
Lord
Commander
: 
Todder
, 
Halder
, 
Grenn
, 
Dareon
, 
Albett
, 
Pypar
, 
Matthar
, and 
Jon
. He then tells the boys that some will
now call them men, but they are fools to believe it and when winter comes they will die like flies. Then Ser Alliser
leaves.
The recruits gather around and offer congratulations to those promoted. As the boys pass a celebratory wineskin
around, Jon notices 
Sam
 standing by himself and goes over to him. Sam proclaims that Jon will be first ranger
someday, like 
his uncle
 “was.” Jon corrects this to “is.” Halder interrupts to ask if Jon is going to drink the wine he
is carrying. Then Pyp grabs the wineskin, and squirts it into Jon’s face. Soon the ecstatic boys start a snowball fight
and by the time Jon can break free, Sam has disappeared.
The promoted boys are treated to a marvelous feast that night to celebrate. The group discusses and jokes about their
assignments: ranger, builder, woodsman, steward. They are all convinced that Jon, as the best swordsman and rider,
will be a ranger, like his uncle “was” the First Ranger. Jon corrects this to “is” once again before pushing his food
away and leaving. Pyp follows and asks what is wrong. Jon explains that it is because Sam is not with them. Without
them to protect him, Sam will be at the mercy of Ser Alliser. Pyp assures Jon that they did all they could for Sam,
but that is not good enough for Jon. Jon goes for a long ride by himself.
As he rides he thinks about the world outside the 
Night's Watch
 and reminds himself that he has not yet sworn his
vow. He thinks of all the places he has wanted to travel to and will never visit. He longs to go back to 
Winterfell
 to
be with his half-brothers, but then remembers that Lady 
Catelyn
 will not welcome him. Jon decides that there is no
place for him in Winterfell or 
King's Landing
, and remembers that not even his mother had a place for him.
Whoever she was, his mother must be something dishonorable, otherwise why would Lord 
Eddard
 be too ashamed
to speak of her? On the ride back Jon thinks about what he should do about Sam.
Jon visits 
Maester
 
Aemon
 despite the late hour. Aemon’s stewards, 
Chett
 and 
Clydas
, considered the ugliest men in
the Watch, meet him at the door. Chett insists that the maester is asleep and orders Jon to come back in the morning.
Jon puts his foot in the door to prevent it closing, and refuses to leave since tomorrow will be too late. Chett goes to
get the maester, while Jon goes to the library and starts a fire as instructed.
When Maester Aemon arrives, he sits by the fire and assures Jon that a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion from
the sleeplessness of old age. Jon asks that Sam be accepted as a sworn brother along with the others. Chett
complains that it is no concern of the maester and Maester Aemon agrees that training is the responsibility of Ser
Alliser. Jon continues on to explain about all he and the others have done to protect Sam.
Chett remains adamant that Ser Alliser will make a man of Sam or kill him trying. Jon replies that the Watch has

need of every man and thus to kill one in futile training would be stupid. Recalling Maester 
Luwin
’s words about
why a maester’s chain is made of many kinds of metal, Jon declares that the Watch (like a kingdom) needs all sorts
of skills and knowledge. Then Jon asks why Sam could not be a steward. As a steward, Chett objects that it is not
easy work fit for cowards: they keep the Watch alive by hunting, farming, gather firewood, make clothing, and bring
up supplies. Maester Aemon calmly names a number of steward duties and Jon has to admit that none of them suit
Sam. Then Jon declares that there is one thing Sam can do better than anyone else: help Maester Aemon, since he
can do sums, read, write, and is good with animals like the ravens. The maester considers this for a while and then
tells Jon that he will think on it.

Tyrion
 and 
Bronn
 make camp on the 
high road
. Tyrion wants to make a fire, but Bronn protests that it will bring the
Vale mountain clans
 down on them. Tyrion sees no point in trying to avoid the clans and Bronn gives in. As Tyrion
plans, the 
Stone Crows
 arrive and Tyrion negotiates an agreement.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 and 
Bronn
 have taken shelter beneath some aspens just off the 
high road
. Tyrion is gathering wood and asks
Bronn if a particular branch will do for a fire. Bronn asks if he has a death wish, as a fire will bring the 
Vale
mountain clans
 down on them. Bronn thinks it is best to travel fast at night, avoid the road, and make no noise or
fires. Tyrion states that traveling fast at night is a good way to fall down the mountain and that the clans will find
them no matter what they do. Bronn replies that that means they are dead men. Tyrion insists that he would prefer to
die comfortable and asks if Bronn can find some game; he does not look forward to the salt beef and hard bread that
Lysa Arryn
 had provided them.
Bronn threatens to take Tyrion’s horse and leave, asking what Tyrion would do. Tyrion replies that he would
probably die. When Bronn asks if Tyrion believes his threat, Tyrion admits he does, commenting that Bronn was
quick to finish off 
Chiggen
 when he took an arrow in the belly. Bronn points out that Chiggen was as good as dead
anyway and would have done the same for him.
Bronn explains that although he fought for Tyrion he is not his friend and not his servant. Tyrion accepts this with
good humor, stating that he is mainly interested in Bronn’s sword, not his friendship. When Bronn asks how Tyrion
knew he would be his champion, Tyrion explains that he did not know, but anticipated Bronn’s 
sellsword
 nature: go
for the gold. Bronn helped take Tyrion captive in hopes of a reward, but the 
Starks
 are too proud to take lowborn
scum like Bronn into their service permanently, so Tyrion had gambled that Bronn would abandon Lady 
Catelyn
 for
the next hopeful venture: rescuing him.
Bronn tells Tyrion that he has a bold tongue and that someday somebody will cut it out and make him eat it. Tyrion
replies that everyone tells him that. Tyrion then declares that although Bronn is scum, he is not stupid and knows
where his best interest lie, luckily for Tyrion. When Bronn quickly lights the fire with flint, Tyrion compliments that
Bronn is also useful and almost as good with a sword as his brother 
Jaime
.
Then Tyrion asks what Bronn wants: gold, land, or women. He promises that if Bronn keeps him alive he will have
it. Bronn asks about what happens if Tyrion dies. Tyrion quips that then he will have one sincere mourner. Bronn
then informs Tyrion that his is no man’s toady. Tyrion replies that he is sure Bronn is no man’s friend, adding that
he is sure Bronn will betray him just like Lady Stark if there is a profit. However, Tyrion begs Bronn to remember
that he will match any price offered to betray him because he likes living. Bronn disappears to go hunting at
Tyrion’s request.
An hour later they are eating a goat they have roasted. Tyrion complains about the meat’s toughness, but says he
will not complain too loudly since at the 
Eyrie
 he would have to dance on a precipice for a boiled bean. Bronn then
complains that Tyrion gave the 
turnkey
 a purse of gold and Tyrion states that a Lannister always pays his debts. He
kept his silver, however. After giving the turnkey the purse, Tyrion told him that if he ever tired of Lady Arryn’s

service, he need only come to 
Casterly Rock
 to get the rest. Bronn asks what Tyrion plans when they reach the river
and Tyrion states a whore, a feather bed, and wine for a start and then on to Casterly Rock or King’s Landing since
he has questions about a dagger. Bronn seems surprised that Tyrion is truly innocent.
As they settle down for the night, Tyrion notes that the clansmen are taking their time. Bronn replies that he would
fear a trap with them being so open. Tyrion suggests they sing to scare them away. As Tyrion whistles a song, he
asks Bronn if he has ever heard it before. Bronn states he has heard it in inns and whorehouses. Tyrion goes on to
say the 
first girl
 he bedded used to sing it. He tells Bronn the story of when he and his brother 
Jaime
 rescued her.
They heard a scream and Tysha came running onto the road chased by two men. Jaime went after the men while
Tyrion dismounted to protect the girl. He tells Bronn that she was about a year older than him, low born, half-
starved, and unwashed. When Jaime left to get help from 
Casterly Rock
, Tyrion took her to an inn where they shared
a meal and talked. The wine went to 13-year old Tyrion’s head and he found himself in bed with her. When he broke
her maidenhead she wept and then kissed him. He found a drunken 
septon
 to marry them and set her up a cottage of
her own where they played man and wife for a fortnight. Then the septon sobered and told 
Tyrion’s father
, and that
was the end of his marriage. Jaime was forced to confess that the girl was a whore and that he set the whole thing
up. Then Lord Tywin gave her to a barracks of guardsmen and paid her a silver for each one. Tywin made Tyrion go
last, having him pay her a gold coin since he was a Lannister.
Bronn states that he would have killed the man who did that to him and Tyrion states that he might yet; a Lannister
always pays his debts. Tyrion rolls into his 
shadowskin
 cloak to sleep, and dreams of the 
sky cells
 but this time he is
the jailor, driving his father back to the abyss.
Bronn wakes him with a warning and Tyrion motions for Bronn to stay still. Then Tyrion calls out for the clansmen
to join them and share their goat. A voice replies that, since this is their mountain, it is their goat. Tyrion agrees that
it is and asks their names. They declare themselves 
Stone Crows
 and a big man named 
Shagga
 armed with two axes
steps into the light first. Slowly the rest emerge, armed with a variety of weapons including pitchforks.
Tyrion introduces himself and declares himself a member of “Clan Lannister.” He offers to pay the clansmen for the
goat they ate. 
Gunthor son of Gurn
, who seems to be their chief, asks what he has to give them, and Tyrion tells
them he has silver in his purse, and his weapons and armor. 
Conn
 replies that Tyrion is going to pay them with their
own coin; they can take what they want from their corpses. Gunthor states they have nothing to give but their lives
and asks Tyrion how he would like to die. Tyrion replies, “In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden’s
mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.” Shagga laughs but the others seem unamused.
Gunthor tells Conn to kill Bronn and take Tyrion to milk goats and make the mothers laugh. Bronn springs to his
feet, asking who dies first, but Tyrion screams for him to stop. Tyrion asks the clansmen if their weapons are the
best they could steal, declaring them good for killing sheep at most. He adds that his father’s smiths shit better
weapons. Gunthor, thinking of the starving women and children of his tribe, is interested and asks what Tyrion will
give them for their lives. In addition to the list of weapons suggested by the tribesmen, Tyrion offers them the 
Vale
of Arryn
.

As 
Hand of the King
, 
Ned
 hears a petition from some 
House Tully
 bannermen concerning raiding on their holdfasts
by 
Gregor Clegane
. He strips Clegane of all lands, titles, and his life and sends a force under Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
to dispense the king's justice.
Synopsis
Eddard Stark
 is in the throne room where 
Robert I Baratheon
's hunting tapestries have replaced the 
skulls of the
Targaryen dragons
. He is extremely uncomfortable after hours on the 
Iron Throne
; the throne's spikes and jagged
metal make it impossible to lean back and his shattered leg is throbbing more sharply each minute. 
Aegon the
Conqueror
, who commanded his armorers to create the throne out of the swords laid down by his enemies, had said
a king should never sit easy. At this point, Ned is damning both Robert and Aegon. His only conciliation is that at
least he can sit, as can the three councilors in attendance: 
Varys
, 
Petyr Baelish
, and Grand Maester 
Pycelle
. The rest
—including the petitioners, lords, and guards—must stand.
The kingdom has been a tinderbox since 
Catelyn Stark
 seized 
Tyrion Lannister
, and Ned has the task of figuring out
how best to stanch the hemorrhaging. Ser 
Karyl Vance
 explains that the smallfolk kneeling before him are all that
remains of the holdfast of 
Sherrer
, while those of 
Wendish Town
 and the 
Mummer's Ford
 are all dead. The villagers
tell of the brutality, murder, rape, and destruction. The 
raiders
 were interested not in stealing but in destruction,
making them 
Lannister
 invaders. Ser 
Raymun Darry
 continues by explaining that the people of Wendish Town took
refuge in their wooden holdfast but the perpetrators burned the holdfast and shot anyone that tried to run out. The
Sherrer holdfast was made of stone, so this tactic did not work.
Ned asks for proof that the raiders were from House Lannister and is told that there were 50 or 100 men, all mounted
on war horses and armored in mail with good weapons. Their armor was plain and they flew no banners but the
leader was as big as an ox: 
Gregor Clegane
, the Mountain That Rides. Pycelle points out that there are many large
men in the kingdom, but the petitioning knights insist there is none as large as the Mountain. Pycelle asks why the
Mountain, who holds lands and is an anointed knight, would turn brigand. Ser 
Marq Piper
 calls the Mountain a false
knight and Lord 
Tywin Lannister
's mad dog. Pycelle asks Ned to remind the knight that Lord Tywin is the father of
their gracious queen, 
Cersei Lannister
. Ned sarcastically declares that the court might have forgotten if Pycelle had
not reminded them. It is then that Ned looks up to see men going out the door and also spots Septa 
Mordane
 with
Sansa Stark
; he has a flash of anger since this is no place for a girl, but calms himself that the septa had no way of
knowing this was no ordinary day.
Littlefinger asks where the knights responsible for protecting these holdfasts were when this destruction was going
on. The petitioning knights reply that they had answered the call of their liege lord to marshal at 
Riverrun
 and below
the 
Golden Tooth
 in anticipation of a Lannister invasion. They also declare that now Ser 
Edmure Tully
 has dispersed
men to guard all the border holdfasts along the 
Red Fork
. Ned thinks to himself that this may be exactly what Lord
Tywin wants: to bleed off the strength of Riverrun as Edmure scatters his swords to defend every holdfast.
Littlefinger asks what the knights are looking for from the throne if they have already protected their lands. They
reply that, as they still keep the king's peace, they seek permission to retaliate. Ned is thankful that they have asked;
Tywin Lannister obviously hoped to provoke a Tully invasion so that he might claim to be the aggrieved party.

Pycelle insists that it is Lord Tywin's responsibility to dispense justice to his bannerman, Ser Gregor, but Ned
reminds everyone that all justice flows from the king.
Pycelle immediately suggests that, in that case, they should wait for Robert to return, but Ned asserts his right as
Hand
 to speak for the king. He spies Ser 
Robar Royce
, whose father is hunting with Robert, and tells him to ride to
the king and advise him of the situation. Ned refuses the petitioning knights permission for vengeance and tells the
villagers he cannot give them back what they have lost, but can give them justice. He continues by telling the
villagers that the 
First Men
 believed that the man who passes judgment should wield the sword, but his injury means
he must send another to do his killing. Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 asks for the honor of slaying Ser Gregor, but Ned denies
him, reiterating that the goal is justice, not vengeance. Ned looks at the assembled lords and orders Lord 
Beric
Dondarrion
, 
Thoros of Myr
, Ser 
Gladden Wylde
, and Lord 
Lothar Mallery
 to each assemble twenty men. Ned also
sends twenty 
House Stark guards
 of 
Winterfell
. Lord Beric is given command, as befits his rank. Then Ned
announces in the name of Robert that these men are charged with bringing to justice the false knight Gregor
Clegane, and that Gregor is stripped of all lands and titles and sentenced to death. Then he tells them to ride at first
light so it can be done quickly, and that the throne will hear no more petitions.
At the base of the throne, 
Varys
 is still gathering papers when everyone else has left. He declares Ned a bolder man
than himself. He goes on to suggest that Ned should have sent Ser Loras, as a man who is an enemy of the
Lannisters would do well to make the 
Tyrells
 his friends. Varys also reminds Ned that it was a slight not to send Ser
Ilyn Payne
 since he is the 
King's Justice
. Ned does not like the man, but tells Varys that he would prefer not to send
a Lannister man to kill a Lannister bannerman. Varys informs Ned that he saw Ilyn in the back and he did not look
pleased, likely because he so loves his work.

Sansa
 wonders with 
Jeyne Poole
 why 
her father
 did not send the gallant Ser 
Loras
 to kill the monster Ser 
Gregor
.
The next day her father reveals that he is sending her and 
Arya
 back to 
Winterfell
. Sansa insists that she cannot
leave because she is to marry Prince 
Joffrey
, who is nothing like 
his father
 and will give her children with golden
hair. This is an epiphany to her father.
Synopsis
Sansa is bewildered that 
her father
 did not send the 
Knight of Flowers
 after Ser 
Gregor Clegane
. She tells her friend
Jeyne Poole
 that she thinks it is because her father was in a foul mood from his leg wound. Sansa believes sending
Ser Loras, who looks like a hero, to slay the monstrous Ser Gregor would have been just like the tales. Sansa tells
Jeyne that she said as much to Septa 
Mordane
, but that the septa only told her not to question her father’s decisions.
Littlefinger
, who had overheard, claimed that her father’s decisions could do with a bit of questioning. When Sansa
had explained to him about monsters and heroes, Littlefinger told her life was not a song.
Jeyne suggests that Lord Eddard should have sent Ser 
Ilyn Payne
, but Sansa replies that he is like a second monster.
Then Jeyne begins to speak dreamily about Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
, telling Sansa how brave and gallant he is. Sansa
can only think that even though Lord Beric is handsome, he is also old: almost 22.
Changing the subject, Sansa tells Jeyne that she has had a dream about Prince 
Joffrey
 taking the white hart the
king’s party is hunting in the 
Kingswood
; it was actually only a wish, but Sansa thinks it sounds better to call it a
dream. In her heart, Sansa thinks that her prince is far worthier than his drunken father. Jeyne asks if Joffrey just
touched the hart in the dream, since that is what heroes always do in the stories, but Sansa insists that Joffrey shot it
with a golden arrow and brought it back for her because she knows Joffrey likes hunting and killing.
Sansa does not think Joffrey had anything to do with killing her father’s men; that was all his uncle 
Jaime
Lannister
’s doing. She knows her father is still angry about it, but believes that blaming Joffrey would be like
blaming her for something 
Arya
 did. The mention of Arya leads Jeyne to speak of how she saw Arya walking on her
hands. Both agree that they cannot understand why Arya does anything.
Next Sansa tells Jeyne about 
Yoren
 coming before the throne to ask for more men to man 
the Wall
. After seeing the
dirty, smelly 
Night's Watch
 recruiter (nothing like her 
Uncle Benjen
), Sansa felt sorry for her bastard brother 
Jon
Snow
. No one would volunteer for the Watch, so her father gave Yoren his pick of the dungeons. Jeyne soon
interrupts Sansa to suggest they go to the kitchen to get some lemon cakes and Sansa agrees.
The next morning Sansa wakes to watch Lord Beric depart with his men and thinks it is a song come to life.
Afterward, the 
Tower of the Hand
 is so empty Sansa is even happy to see Arya. Arya asks if the men have gone to
hunt down Jaime Lannister, and Sansa explains that they have gone for Ser Gregor Clegane. Sansa then asks Septa
Mordane whether they will put the Mountain’s head on a spike over his own gate or bring it back to 
King's Landing
.
The septa is horrified that Sansa would discuss such a thing over breakfast.
Arya wonders why men were not sent after Jaime Lannister, since he killed 
Jory Cassel
 and the others, or after 
the
Hound
 for killing her friend 
Mycah
. Sansa declares that it is not the same thing because Mycah attacked Joffrey.

Arya erupts, shouting that Sansa is a liar. Sansa responds snobbishly that Arya can say whatever she wants but will
still have to bow and call her “Your Grace” after she marries Joffrey. Arya throws an orange at Sansa, staining her
beautiful ivory dress and driving Sansa to declare that it should have been Arya they killed, not 
Lady
. The septa
orders both of them to their rooms, where Sansa tears off her stained clothes and goes to sleep.
Sansa is dreaming of Lady when Septa Mordane wakes her and brings her to her father. Once Arya is brought, Sansa
immediately claims that Arya started the fight and ruined her dress. Eddard silences Sansa and Arya takes the
opportunity to apologize and ask for Sansa’s forgiveness. Sansa is dumbfounded but eventually asks about her dress.
Arya offers to wash it, or failing that to sew her a new one.
Eddard interrupts to tell them that he did not call them in to talk about dresses but to inform them that he is sending
them back to 
Winterfell
. Both sisters exclaim their unhappiness, and Eddard laughs that at last they can agree upon
something. Sansa insists that she has done nothing wrong and tells her father to send Arya away since she started it.
Eddard explains that he is not sending them away as a punishment, but to keep them safe.
Sansa insists that she cannot go; she is to marry Prince 
Joffrey
, whom she loves as much as Queen 
Naerys
 loved
Prince 
Aemon
. She wants to be his queen and have his babies. Eddard assures Sansa that he will find her an
appropriate match and that Joffrey is no Prince Aemon. Sansa insists that she wants Joffrey and that she will give
him a son with beautiful golden hair who will be the greatest king there ever was, as brave as a 
wolf
 and as proud as
a 
lion
. Arya points out that Joffrey is not a lion, but a 
stag
 like his father, and a craven and a liar besides. Sansa cries
out
He is 
not!
 He's not the least bit like that old drunken king.
Eddard gets a strange look on his face before telling them that they will sail as soon as he can find a ship. He also
warns them not to tell anybody. Septa Mordane returns to urge Sansa to stop crying while Arya insists that a journey
by ship will be an adventure and that they will get to see everybody back at Winterfell again. Sansa remains furious
and storms off to her bedchamber and bars the door.

Jon Arryn
 died for. He also learns from 
Pycelle
 and 
Petyr Baelish
 that Lord 
Tywin
Lannister
 is preparing for a war. Later, Ned meets with Cersei and tells her that he will tell 
Robert
 the truth when he
returns, offering her the chance to flee and save her children. Cersei warns that Ned has made a mistake.
Synopsis
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 tells 
Eddard Stark
 that the pain means that the bone is healing, but Ned only replies that he
will be happy when his leg stops throbbing. Pycelle provides him with the 
milk of the poppy
 for the pain, but Ned
says he sleeps too much already. Pycelle tells him sleep is good for healing.
Pycelle informs Ned that Queen 
Cersei
 has received a letter from her father. Lord 
Tywin
 is angry about Ned sending
men to bring Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 to justice. Ned replies that it does not bother him; Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
 rides
under the king’s banner and if Lord Tywin attempts to interfere he will have 
Robert
 to answer to, and the only thing
Robert likes better than hunting is making war on defiant lords. Pycelle leaves, telling Ned that he will come again
the next day.
Ned knows Pycelle is Cersei’s creature, and doesn’t care. He is not actually confident in Robert, but he does not
want Cersei to know that. He calls for honeyed wine, which will not cloud his mind as badly as the milk of the
poppy, because he needs to think. Ned thinks how sometimes a child’s innocent eyes can see things that grown men
are blind to and how some day he will have to tell 
Sansa
 how she made it all come clear to him.
Littlefinger
 pays a visit an hour after Pycelle leaves, bringing news that 
Varys
 has heard whispers that 
sellswords
 are
flocking to 
Casterly Rock
. Ned asks about Robert and is told that, having found the white hart dead, the king is now
after a fierce boar. Most of the hunting party has returned, however, including Prince 
Joffrey
 and 
the Hound
.
Littlefinger states that he would have liked to have seen the Hound’s reaction to learning that 
Beric Dondarrion
 is
after the 
brother
 he hates. With that Littlefinger leaves for a dinner, but not before noting the book of 
The Lineages
and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms
, and teasingly asking if it is a sleeping potion.
Ned considers that, outside of his retainers, there is not a man in the city he trusts: Littlefinger leaving before the
slaughter
 of his guard rankles him, Varys knows too much and does too little, Pycelle is Cersei’s, and Ser 
Barristan
is too old and rigid in his sense of duty.
Arya
 and Sansa will sail in three days. Ned knows that honor will require him to go to Robert with all he knows
when he returns. Last night he dreamed of when Lord Tywin had presented the bodies of Prince 
Rhaegar
’s children
to Robert. Ned remembers that Robert could be merciful if a man were brave and honest; he had pardoned Ser
Barristan, Varys, Pycelle, 
Balon Greyjoy
, and Littlefinger and let them keep their office for an offer of fealty.
However poison in the dark he will never forgive and would kill them all. 
Bran
 must have learned some part of the
truth; otherwise they would not have tried to kill him. Ned decides that he must find a way to save the children.
Ned calls in 
Fat Tom
, now in command of his guardsmen and asks to be taken to the 
godswood
. Ned also orders the
guard doubled despite the shortage of manpower. Ned sends Tom to find Queen Cersei and give her a letter inviting
her to join him. As he sits in the godswood, Ned feels the presence of his gods under the faceless 
heart tree
 and his

leg does not seem to hurt as much.
When Cersei arrives at nightfall, Ned notes that she is proudly displaying the bruise Robert has given her. For the
first time in a long time, Ned can see her beauty. When he declares that he knows the truth 
Jon Arryn
 died for,
Cersei scoffs whether he has brought her here to pose riddles or to kidnap her. Ned replies that if she believed such
things she would not have come. He then asks about the bruise, and if Robert does such things often. She replies that
it has never been on the face before and that her brother Jaime would have killed Robert if he knew.
When Ned suggests a correction of “brother” to “lover,” Cersei does not trouble to deny it. Cersei admits that she
and Jaime have been lovers since they were children and that when Jaime is in her she feels whole. When Ned asks
about his son Bran, Cersei admits that he saw her and Jaime, offering her love for her own children as a reason for
the attempted murder. Ned counters with a declaration that all three of Cersei’s children are Jaime’s. The last time a
Baratheon
 had a child with a 
Lannister
 was 90 years before when 
Tya Lannister
 wedded 
Gowen Baratheon
; the
single child was large and lusty boy with a full head of black hair. Thirty years before that a Lannister had taken a
Baratheon maid; all the children had black hair. According to 
The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the
Seven Kingdoms
, the children of a Lannister and a Baratheon always had black hair.
Ned asks Cersei how it is possible that she never had a child by the king, and she admits she almost did but had the
child aborted. Cersei goes on to claim that she cannot stand to even touch Robert now, and has not let him inside her
for years. Instead she pleasures the king in other ways when he leaves his whores long enough; Robert is always so
drunk that he never remembers.
When Ned asks what made her hate Robert so much, Cersei reveals that on their wedding night Robert called her
“
Lyanna
” in the midst of the consummation. The story leads Ned to declare that he does not know which of them to
pity more, but that he must still do his duty. Cersei makes a sexual advance on Ned while telling him that the realm
needs a strong Hand and that he will never regret being kind to her. Ned immediately rejects the advance by asking
if she made the same offer to 
Jon Arryn
 and she slaps him. Offended by Ned’s honorable persona, Cersei brings up
Jon Snow
 and accuses Ned of many other possible debaucheries.
Ned makes it clear that he intends to tell Robert everything when he returns and warns Cersei to leave 
King's
Landing
. He recommends that she take a ship to the 
Free Cities
 with all her immediate family, including 
her father
,
to escape Robert’s wrath. Cersei stands, laughs, and declares Ned a fool for not taking the throne himself fourteen
years before, when he forced Jaime to surrender the seat. Ned replies that he has made more mistakes than Cersei
can imagine, but that was not one of them. Cersei insists that it was, saying "When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die. There is no middle ground."

Daenerys
 eats a 
stallion heart
 as part of a 
Dothraki
 pregnancy ritual. Afterwards she baths in the 
Womb of the World
and goes to the reception feast. 
Viserys
 soon arrives, drunk and screaming. He draws his blade and demands what he
is owed. 
Khal
 
Drogo
 gives him a crown of molten gold.
Synopsis
The 
stallion’s heart
 is still raw and steaming when it is placed before 
Daenerys
. As part of the ancient 
Dothraki
motherhood ritual she begins to eat the tough, stringy flesh. The Dothraki believe that the heart of the stallion will
make her son strong and swift and fearless. If she chokes on the blood or retches the omens are less favorable: the
child could be weak, deformed, stillborn, or female. In preparation, Daenerys has eaten bowls of blood and dried
horse flesh and fasted for a day and a half, yet still her stomach roils and her jaw aches.
Khal
 
Drogo
 stands over her as she eats, his face hard, but as she continues Daenerys begins to see pride in his eyes.
When she is done, Daenerys pronounces the words she has rehearsed to the 
dosh khaleen
, the crones of 
Vaes
Dothrak
. Even the most powerful 
khals
 bow to the wisdom and authority of these crones, each of whom is the
khaleesi
 of a dead 
khal
.
The crones proclaim, “The prince is riding; a boy, a boy, a strong boy,” and begin to chant. After the crowd finishes
chanting there is silence. Then one of the crones announces the greatness of the new prince, the 
Stallion Who
Mounts the World
. Daenerys reveals the name of her son: 
Rhaego
, in honor of her 
older brother
.
Khal Drogo leads her out of the pit with his 
bloodriders
 behind, followed by the rest, down the godsway. As they
walk, Drogo asks about the name of their son and Daenerys explains about her brother, a fierce warrior who died
before she was born; the last of the dragons. Drogo declares that it is a good name.
Eventually they arrive at the lake called the 
Womb of the World
. Here Daenerys strips out of her soiled clothing and
enters the lake. She cleanses her face and body of the dried blood. When she emerges from the lake, 
Doreah
 brings
her a robe of sandsilk, but Drogo waves her away. Daenerys can see his manhood through his trousers and helps him
unlace; with three quick strokes, he is done.
They ride down the godsway to Drogo’s tent-hall where there is a great feast prepared for those too low of rank to
attend the ceremony. As Dany rides up the aisle, the crowd hails the life within her. When she dismounts, Daenerys
cannot find 
Viserys Targaryen
. She sees Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 in a place of respect in the midst of the hierarchy and
invites him to her own table.
When Ser Jorah arrives she asks about Viserys. He explains that her brother went to the market to find wine.
Daenerys then questions why he was allowed to go alone since 
the Usurper
 would pay well for his head. Ser Jorah
assures her that Viserys should be safe, as nobody can carry a blade or shed a man’s blood in 
Vaes Dothrak
.
Daenerys states that men still die; some of the merchants have huge eunuchs to strangle thieves bloodlessly. Ser
Jorah declares that her brother should be wise enough not to steal anything. The knight goes on to explain that her
brother was going to steal her dragon eggs until he threatened to cut off Viserys' hand. Daenerys declares that she
would have given Viserys an egg if he had asked: she does owe him for their survival and he is all she has left of her

family. Jorah tells her that she belongs to the Dothraki now.
Daenerys asks Ser Jorah about the Stallion Who Mounts the World. He explains that the Stallion is the 
khal
 of 
khals
,
who is prophesized to unite the Dothraki into a single 
khalasar
 and lead them to conquer the world.
Doreah interrupts Daenerys to point out her brother entering the hall in rags, drunk, and carrying a sword. Angry
mutterings rise all around her and the music dies away. Daenerys has a sense of dread and asks Ser Jorah to stop him
and bring him to her. Viserys starts screaming for Daenerys and reproaching the indignity of starting the feast before
his arrival. Ser Jorah is quickly by his side and tries to stop him, but Viserys jerks free. Then he moves to sit with
Drogo and the other 
khals
.
Drogo rises and declares through translation that Viserys’ place is not on the high bench but at the back where the
lowest of the low sit shrouded in shadow so that others do not have to look upon them. Viserys declares drunkenly
that that is no place for a king, but Drogo emphasizes that it is his place, mocking him as the Sore-foot King and the
Cart King. Viserys draws his blade, angering the Dothraki.Then he spots Daenerys and stalks over. She begs him to
throw away the sword but Viserys ignores her. Viserys demands his crown or else he will take Daenerys back, but
he will be happy to cut out her child and leave it for Drogo. To emphasis his point, Viserys presses his sword against
her belly hard enough to prick her navel through her silks.
Jhiqui
 is sobbing in fear, stating that she dare not translate Viserys’ words; if she does she fears Khal Drogo will
drag her behind his horses up the 
Mother of Mountains
. Daenerys agrees to translate instead. After hearing the
translation, Drogo makes a statement in Dothraki and steps down from the high bench with his bloodriders. Viserys
asks and Daenerys translates: “You shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.” Viserys
smiles and declares that that is all he ever wanted. His smile is what saddens Daenerys the most.
Drogo orders his bloodriders to seize the man who was her brother, breaking his arm and taking away his sword in
the process. Drogo puts his belt of golden medallions into an emptied stew pot. Viserys finally realizes what is
happening and begins to plead and struggle. Ser Jorah tells Daenerys to look away, but she refuses. When the gold is
half melted, Drogo declares “Crown for Cart King!” and upends the pot over Viserys’ head. Soon it is over; not a
drop of blood is spilled. Daenerys thinks, surprisingly calmly, that Viserys was no dragon, because fire cannot kill a
dragon.

Ned
 learns that King 
Robert
 has been mortally wounded by a boar. In his will, Robert declares Ned the 
Regent
.
Afterward, 
Renly Baratheon
 urges Ned to seize the royal children to secure his power, but Ned refuses. Ned writes a
letter offering the throne to 
Stannis Baratheon
 as the rightful heir. Reconsidering his need for men, Ned declares his
intentions to 
Littlefinger
 and asks him to arrange the support of the 
City Watch
.
Synopsis
Ned
 is dreaming of walking through the crypts beneath 
Winterfell
. The 
Kings of Winter
 watch him with eyes of ice
and the 
direwolves
 at their feet snarl. Finally, he comes to the tomb where 
his father
 sleeps with 
Lyanna
 and
Brandon
 beside him. Lyanna's statue whispers, “Promise me, Ned,” and her eyes weep blood. Ned jerks awake with
someone pounding at his door.
The king’s steward tells Ned that King 
Robert
 demands his presence at once. When Ned reaches 
Maegor's Holdfast
,
he finds the 
Kingsguard
 guarding the bridge, the steps, and the royal apartments. Ned only has to look at Ser
Barristan Selmy
, who is waiting outside the king’s bedchamber, to know something is terribly wrong.
Inside the bedchamber, he finds Robert in bed with 
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
, 
Renly Baratheon
, and 
Cersei Lannister
gathered around him. The room smells of smoke, blood, and death. Tattered and blood-stained clothes litter the
floor. Ned can see that his friend is dying. Renly explains that it was a boar, and Robert curses himself for drinking
too much wine and missing his thrust. When Ned asks where the rest of them were, Renly explains that Robert had
called everyone off to try to take the boar himself. Ned lifts the blanket and verifies that they have done what they
can to close the rip from groin to nipple, but it is not nearly enough. The smell of death is horrible and
overpowering; Robert declares that even he can smell it, but still takes pride in having killed the boar, which he
wants served at his funeral feast.
Robert then orders everyone but Ned to leave. Pycelle tries to give Robert the 
milk of the poppy
 before leaving, but
Robert refuses. Once they are gone, Ned damns Robert for being so headstrong. Robert damns Ned right back,
declaring that he killed the boar and should have done the same to Ned for not leaving him to hunt in peace. He then
admits that Ned was right about 
Daenerys Targaryen
 and asserts the boar was sent by the gods to punish him. Robert
then expresses gratitude and admiration that Ned was the only one to tell him that he was wrong.
Robert tells Ned to write his final testament, in which he names Ned as 
Lord Regent
 and Protector of the Realm
until his son comes of age. Ned cannot bring himself to tell Robert that 
Joffrey
 is not his son, so instead he
clandestinely changes the words to “my heir,” feeling soiled as he does so. Ned tells Robert that he cannot die
because the realm needs him, but Robert replies that the realm knows what a wretched king he was: as bad as 
Aerys
.
Ned insists that Robert was not as bad as Aerys and Robert declares that at least this one thing he did right: he has
declared Ned as Regent and Ned will do it well. Robert signs the document and tells Ned that they are to serve the
boar at his funeral feast. He then asks that Ned rescind the death warrant on Daenerys and also to help his son be
better than he has been. Before Ned leaves, the king mumbles that he ought to laugh at being killed by a pig, but it
hurts too much.
The queen has left, but the rest come back in. The king has Renly and Pycelle bear witness to his placing the seal on

the letter. Then the king asks for and drinks the milk of the poppy. As he fades off to sleep, he asks Ned if he will
dream and Ned assures him he will. Then Robert declares that he will give Ned’s love to 
Lyanna
. Last of all, Robert
requests that Ned guard his children. Unable to tell the truth and unable to lie, all that Ned can think of is Robert’s
bastards when he tells him that he will.
Pycelle tells Ned that he has done all that he can, but the wound has already mortified because it took two days to
get Robert back. When Ned asks how long, he is told that by rights the king should be dead already. Renly adds that
Robert was always strong, though perhaps not wise, recounting that Robert slew the boar even with his guts hanging
out. Ned replies admiringly that Robert was never one to leave the battle with an enemy standing.
Ser Barristan is still standing outside and Ned tells him that the king is not to be disturbed. Ser Barristan laments that
he has failed his sacred trust. Ned reassures the old knight that no one can defend a man against himself and even the
king blamed the wine. The knight admits that Robert was reeling drunk. 
Varys
, who has just appeared, asks who
gave Robert all the wine, and Ser Barristan tells them it was the king’s elder squire, 
Lancel Lannister
. Varys states
that he hopes the lad does not blame himself. Ned informs Varys that the king wants the assassination of Daenerys
canceled. Varys tells him that those birds have flown but he will do what he can.
Tomard
 and 
Cayn
 are helping Ned across the bridge when Renly catches up and asks for a private word. Renly asks
if Robert’s will makes him regent and, knowing his answer, tells Ned that he has 100 swords to offer him. Renly
declares that if they strike now, they can take the 
Red Keep
 and seize the royal children. Ned refuses, stating that
while Robert is still alive he will not shed blood in the castle. Renly insists that every moment Ned delays gives
Cersei more time to prepare. Ned declares that they should pray for Robert’s recovery; sometimes the gods are
merciful. Renly answers that the 
Lannisters
 are not.
By the time he returns to his 
tower
, Ned is wondering if he should have accepted Renly’s offer; if the queen fights
he will need every sword he can get. He has no taste for these intrigues. Ned first asks Cayn to bring 
Littlefinger
 to
him and then commands Tomard to take 20 men to escort his daughters to the ship to take them to Winterfell. He
then tells Tomard to stop at 
Dragonstone
 on the way and deliver a letter for to Lord 
Stannis
, for his eyes only. After
Tomard leaves, Ned sits in grief for his friend Robert and thinks how some will say that he had betrayed his king’s
friendship and disinherited his sons. He hopes the gods will know better and that Robert will learn the truth in the
land beyond the grave. He then composes a letter to Stannis, telling him of Robert’s death and offering him the
throne as the rightful heir. As he seals the letter, Ned reflects that his regency will be short and then he can return to
Winterfell.
Littlefinger arrives and congratulates Ned for being named Protector of the Realm. When asked how he knows,
Littlefinger states that Varys told him and that Ned has just confirmed it. Ned damns Varys and his birds and states
that he does not trust him. Littlefinger declares that Ned is learning. Ned says he knows the secret that 
Jon Arryn
was murdered for. Littlefinger's lack of reaction to the truth shows that he obviously knew the secret all along.
Ned declares his intention to offer the throne to Stannis, but Littlefinger says he would be wise to bow to 
Joffrey
.
Stannis is not a friend of Ned or Littlefinger; even his brothers cannot stand him because he is hard and unyielding.
Stannis will appoint his own Hand and Small Council, and his ascension will mean war for the realm. Stannis will
seek the heads of Cersei and the children to secure his position on the 
Iron Throne
 (an act that will incite 
Tywin
Lannister
 and the houses sworn to 
Casterly Rock
 to an uprising), those of Lords 
Tyrell
 and 
Redwyne
 as revenge for
the 
Siege of Storm's End
, and even Lord 
Balon Greyjoy
 for his 
rebellion
. According to Littlefinger, anyone who
stood by the 
Targaryens
 during 
Robert's Rebellion
 or rose with the Greyjoys will have cause to fear Stannis' ascent
to the throne.
Littlefinger proposes another course of action: that Ned make his peace with the Lannisters, wed 
Sansa
 to Joffrey,
Robb
 to 
Myrcella
, and 
Arya
 to 
Tommen
 and rule as Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey
comes of age in four years’ time. This should be sufficient time to deal with Stannis and, should Joffrey prove
unsuitable, they can reveal the truth of his parentage and place Renly on the throne. Ned declares that what
Littlefinger is proposing is treason. Littlefinger replies that it will only be treason if they lose. Ned tells him that he
forgets Jon Arryn, 
Jory Cassel
, and the attempt to kill 
Bran
. Littlefinger states that the only thing he forgot was that
he was talking to a 
Stark
.
Ned declares that he is going to call on the aid Littlefinger promised 
Catelyn
. Cersei has a dozen knights and 100

men-at-arms, enough to overwhelm his household guard. Littlefinger then points out there are lords that have no
love for the 
Lannisters
 that have guards. Ned states they are not enough—he needs Littlefinger to secure him the
City Watch of King's Landing
. Littlefinger insists that when the Hand proclaims one king and the Queen another,
the Gold Cloaks will side with the one who pays better. With that in mind, Littlefinger states that he will meet with
City Watch Commander 
Janos Slynt
 with a bribe of 6,000 
gold dragons
.

Jon
 is disgusted to learn that he will be a steward, not a ranger. 
Sam
 convinces Jon that being the 
Lord
Commander’s
 steward is actually an honor meant to groom him for command. Jon and Sam are taken to a 
godswood
beyond the Wall
 to say their vows before the 
old gods
. After they have taken their vows, 
Ghost
 returns with a human
hand in his jaws.
Synopsis
Jon
 is eating breakfast when 
Sam
 excitedly tells that he has been passed out of training with Jon and the rest. Jon
feigns surprise and Sam explains that he will be working for 
Maester
 
Aemon
, who needs somebody who can read
and write to work in the library and with the birds. Sam is concerned about getting to the 
sept
 in time, otherwise the
officers may change their minds. When they arrive at the sept the other recruits are genuinely shocked to see Sam,
but no one dares to say a word.
All the officers arrive together. 
Lord Commander
 
Jeor Mormont
 makes his customary speech about taking vows and
being a member of the 
Night's Watch
. Mormont asks if any wish to leave before taking their vows, but no one does.
Then Mormont asks if any of them follow the 
old gods
 and Jon speaks up. The recruits whisper that there is no
godswood
 at 
the Wall
. Mormont confirms that 
Castle Black
 has no need of a godswood since the 
haunted forest
beyond the Wall stands as it did in the 
Dawn Age
 and there is a 
weirwood
 grove half a league from the castle. It is
then that Sam speaks up that he also wants to swear his vows before the 
heart tree
, despite being born into the 
Faith
of the Seven
. When Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
 questions why Sam would forsake the gods of his 
House
, Sam declares that
the Night’s Watch is his House now and the Seven have never answered his prayers.
At the end of the ceremony, the Lord Commander announces the assignments: 
Halder
 and 
Albett
 to the builders;
Grenn
, 
Pypar
, 
Todder
, and 
Matthar
 to the rangers; Samwell, 
Dareon
, and Jon to the stewards. Jon is flabbergasted
and believes there must be a mistake, but when he sees Ser 
Alliser Thorne
’s black eyes studying him he knows it is
an intentional snub. The Lord Commander pronounces his last words and leaves. The Firsts call the recruits from
each of the groups.
After the rest are gone, Lord Steward 
Bowen Marsh
 states that Sam will work in the library and rookery with
Maester Aemon, since 
Chett
 has been reassigned to the kennels. Dareon will be sent to 
Eastwatch
 to work with the
merchants. Jon will be personal steward to the Lord Commander at Mormont's own request. Jon sarcastically
suggests a number of menial duties for himself and is told “certainly” and given several more duties. When Jon asks
if they take him for a servant, Maester Aemon answers that they took him for a man of the Night’s Watch, though
perhaps they were wrong.
Outside in the yard, Jon rants about the unfairness of his appointment, since he is a better swordsman and rider.
Dareon is angered by Jon’s tantrum, since he himself was unfairly sent to the Wall for a false accusation. Sam quiets
Jon by telling him the Lord Commander probably intends to groom him for command. Sam explains that 
his father
once insisted that he be at his side for all important events but once he fell out of favor his father no longer cared.
Suddenly Jon is ashamed; Sam has accepted his situation like a man, while he has been playing the boy. Jon admits
that Sam is right and agrees to take his vows.

Late that afternoon, they proceed through the cold tunnel under the Wall and through three gates that Bowen Marsh
must unlock. When they are finally outside again, Sam worries about the 
wildlings
 but is told they have never come
this close to the Wall. Never-the-less, they are joined by an escort of rangers. Jon whistles and 
Ghost
 lopes out of the
tunnel and then into the woods. The haunted forest is much like the 
Wolfswood
 around 
Winterfell
, but its feel is
much more ominous. It is dusk when they finally arrive at a clearing with nine weirwoods, a number unheard of
south of the Wall. Sam looks at the faces on each of the trees and says that he can feel the old gods watching.
As night falls, Jon and Sam kneel and say their vows together:
Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands,
father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in
the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the
dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to
the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.
When they are finished, Bowen Marsh declares that they knelt as boys and now rise as men of the Night’s Watch.
The gnarled forester 
Dywen
 says they should be getting back because there is something in the night he dislikes.
Then Ghost returns, his red eyes and white face eerily like the faces carved in the weirwoods. In his jaws is a human
hand.

Robert
’s death, 
Ned
 convenes the 
small council
 to confirm him as Protector of the Realm. However, the
council is interrupted by a summons to the throne room where King 
Joffrey
 demands oaths fealty. Queen 
Cersei
destroys Robert’s will and Ned declares Joffrey has no right to the

rises to follow but Ned stops her, declaring that he will try to explain when they return to 
Winterfell
.
An hour later, 
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 arrives with news that King 
Robert
 is dead. Although he has been expecting
the news, Ned is surprised by the emptiness it leaves inside him, as if part of him has died as well. Suppressing his
grief, Ned orders Pycelle to convene the 
small council
 in the 
Tower of the Hand
, not trusting the security of the
council chamber. The Grand Maester objects that they can wait a day, but Ned insists so Pycelle dispatches servants
to carry the summons.
Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 arrives first and asks permission to attend King 
Joffrey
 instead, but Ned refuses. When
Littlefinger
 arrives wearing the same clothes as the previous day, he declares that the task Ned set him is done.
Varys
 arrives next with news that Lord 
Renly
 has left the city along with Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 and fifty retainers,
slipping out a postern gate an hour before dawn and riding south for 
Storm's End
 or 
Highgarden
. Ned is
discomforted by the news, since he had remained hopeful of Renly’s support.
Ned entrusts Ser 
Barristan
 to read the writ naming him Protector of the Realm until the heir comes of age. Ned
thinks to himself that the 
true heir
 is already of age, but says nothing; he does not trust Varys or Pycelle and Ser
Barristan is honor bound to protect the boy he thinks is his rightful king. The need for deceit bothers him, but Ned
knows he must keep Cersei’s secret until he is firmly established as regent. There will be plenty of time to deal with
the succession when his daughters are safe and Stannis has arrived with his forces. Ned asks the council to proclaim
him Protector of the Realm as Robert wished. Before anyone can reply, the meeting is interrupted by 
Fat Tom
 and
the royal steward with news that the king demands the small council’s immediate presence in the throne room. Ned
is unsurprised that Cersei would strike quickly, and orders Tom to assemble an escort.
Escorted by eight men-at-arms and supported by Littlefinger, Ned makes his way across the yard, reassured by the
number of Stark guardsmen on the walls. Inside the throne room, Joffrey sits the 
Iron Throne
 with Cersei and his
siblings below, guarded by 
Sandor Clegane
 and all of the 
Kingsguard
 except 
Jaime Lannister
 and Ser Barristan, who
has just arrived with Ned. Behind the throne stand twenty Lannister guardsmen armed with swords, and along the
walls are a hundred 
gold cloaks
 armed with spears, enough to outnumber the Lannisters five to one. At the sight of
the gold cloaks, Ned is encouraged that Littlefinger has kept his promise.

Joffrey stands and commands that the council make arrangements for his coronation which he wishes held within the
fortnight. The young king then declares that today he will accept oaths of fealty from his loyal councilors. Ned has
Varys deliver Robert’s will to Cersei. The queen glances at the words then tears it up, questioning if Ned meant a
piece of paper to be his shield. The honorable Ser Barristan exclaims that those were the king’s words, but Cersei
dismissively declares that they have a new king now. Then Cersei advises Ned that if he bends the knee and swears
fealty to Joffrey he will be allowed to retire peacefully to Winterfell. Instead, bound by his honor, Ned declares that
Joffrey has no right to the throne and that 
Stannis
 is the true heir.
Joffrey bursts out in anger and Cersei orders Ser Barristan to seize Ned as a traitor. The old knight hesitates and is
quickly surrounded by Ned’s guardsmen. At Cersei’s command, the Hound and the Lannister guardsmen draw their
swords to aid in the arrest. Ned responds by ordering 
Janos Slynt
 to have his gold cloaks take the queen and her
children into custody. As Ned is stating he wants no bloodshed, a gold cloak shoves a spear through Tomard’s back.
A brief fight ensues, quickly killing all of Ned’s guardsmen. As Ned’s men die around him, Littlefinger slides Ned’s
dagger from its sheath, holds it to his throat, and says,
"I did warn you not to trust me, you know."

Arya
’s training with 
Syrio Forel
 is interrupted by Ser 
Meryn Trant
 and a party of 
Lannister guardsmen
. When
Meryn demands Arya come with him, Syrio senses something odd and fights the guards, giving Arya time to escape.
At the stables Arya finds her sword 
Needle
 and kills a stable boy who attempts to capture her before escaping via the
dungeons of the 
Red Keep
.
Synopsis
Arya
 is training with 
Syrio Forel
 in the Small Hall before they are due to board ship for 
Winterfell
. Syrio calls his
strikes and Arya blocks each in turn until one hits her breast from the wrong side and Syrio says she is dead. Arya
complains that Syrio cheated by lying. The swordsman says only his words lied, not his eyes or his arm, but she was
not seeing. Arya insists that she watched him every second, but Syrio declares that watching is not seeing. To
illustrate his point, Syrio tells her how he became the 
First Sword of Braavos
.
Syrio explains that there were many who were stronger, faster, or younger, but he was the best because he could see
the truth. After the death of the previous First Sword, many 
bravos
 were called to the 
Sealord
 and as many were sent
away. Finally, Syrio was called before the Sealord, who had a fat yellow cat on his lap. The Sealord said the animal
had been brought to him from a faraway land by one of his captains and asked if Syrio had ever seen her like. Syrio
replied that he had seen a thousand like him in the alleys of Braavos, and that same day Syrio was named the First
Sword. Arya says she does not understand. Syrio explains that the cat was just an ordinary one, but the other men all
expected a marvelous beast, so that was what they saw. In addition, the Sealord had called it “her” and that was what
the others saw, even though it was clearly a tomcat. Arya understands then, and Syrio tells her to uses her senses
first and her mind second. Then he declares that when they get to Winterfell it will be time to put “
Needle
” in her
hand.
The great wooden doors fly open to reveal five 
Lannister guardsmen
 and Ser 
Meryn Trant
 of the 
Kingsguard
. Meryn
orders Arya to come with him to see her father. Arya is about to follow when Syrio stops her and asks why Lord
Eddard
 would send Lannister men instead of his own. Arya immediately realizes the truth of Syrio’s statement and
picks up her stick sword. When Meryn insists he is trustworthy as a member of the Kingsguard, Arya replies that so
is 
the Kingslayer
.
Dispensing with the charade, Meryn orders Arya seized. When a guard approaches Arya, Syrio stands before her.
The guard orders Syrio out of the way, calling him an old man. Syrio declares his name and that they will be
speaking to him with more respect. Unimpressed, the guard goes for his sword but Syrio is faster and breaks the
man’s fingers with his wooden sword. Then Meryn orders the Lannister guards to attack and Syrio instructs Arya to
go to her father. As the guards attack Syrio, Arya can see that Syrio was only toying with her during their practices;
by the time Arya reaches the far end of the hall, Syrio is surrounded by five dead or dying men. Then Meryn, in his
heavy plate armor, draws his sword. Syrio tells Arya to go, but she watches as the First Sword lands many blows on
the knight's armor before Meryn breaks Syrio’s wooden sword. Arya turns and runs through the kitchen, crying.
As she runs, Arya thinks of everything Syrio has told her: “Swift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. Quick as a snake.
Calm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than
swords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords…”

Her sword grip is slick with sweat when she reaches the turret stair. She wonders if she should go up or down. She
then remembers Syrio telling her to do the unexpected, so she goes down to a cavernous cellar that she knows is a
dead end. She climbs up to a window. Outside the window she can see the stout door to the 
Tower of the Hand
 is
splintered, one of her father’s guards lies dead on the stairs, and she can hear fighting. She thinks about when she
heard a man say that if one 
Hand
 can die, so can another. As she moves, Arya pretends that she is catching cats but
then realizes that she is the cat and is dead if they catch her.
Outside the stable she finds 
Hullen
 lying on the ground, looking dead. When she approaches him, he opens his eyes
and tells her to warn her father before dying. Inside, Arya finds more dead men including 
Desmond
, who said he
would protect her father. There is only a single Lannister body, and Arya remembers Desmond's claim that every
northman
 was worth ten 
southrons
. Losing her temper, Arya kicks Desmond's body and calls him a liar.
As Arya collects horse tack, she finds her broken chest on the ground. She gropes around for 
Needle
. Just as her
fingers touch the sword a stable boy appears behind her with a pitchfork. She asks him to help her saddle a horse,
saying her father will reward him. The boy responds that her father is dead and that 
the queen
 will reward him.
When he grabs her arm, Arya forgets all of Syrio’s lessons, only remembering the lesson that 
Jon Snow
 taught her.
She sticks the pointy end through the boy’s belly, killing him.
As she saddles her mare, Arya realizes that the gates will be closed and the guards will let no one out; she has to go
another way. Immediately she wonders if she can find the room with the monsters again. However, to do that she
must cross the open yard and the walls are crowded with more 
gold cloaks
 and soldiers than she has ever seen.
Reciting Syrio’s words to herself, she walks slowly across the yard to the empty royal sept, hiding Needle under the
cloak she has put on; it is the scariest thing she has ever done. Taking two of the candles in the sept, she crawls out a
back window.
It takes Arya more than an hour to find the room: crawling through windows, over walls, and through cellars. She
goes back to light her candle and returns. Now the monsters do not frighten her. Neither do the rats in the dungeons.
The 
crypts of Winterfell
 were scarier, and she and her siblings were once taken there by 
Robb
 to visit their own
waiting tombs. Then Jon had suddenly appeared covered in flour, pretending to be a ghost, but that had not scared
her. The memory of her safe home at Winterfell makes Arya smile as she plunges deeper into the darkness of the
tunnel.

Sansa V
On the third day after sneaking out to tell Queen 
Cersei
 of 
her father
’s plans to send her away, 
Sansa
 is summoned
from her house arrest. She is brought before the queen and the 
small council
. There she is informed that her father is
a traitor and is persuaded to write letters to her relatives explaining what has happened.
Synopsis
Sansa
 is locked in a room with 
Jeyne Poole
, who does nothing but cry for 
her father
. Sansa, thinking Jeyne was
acting childish, has told her friend that she would ask 
Queen Cersei
 to let her see her father, but it does not seem to
have helped.
Sansa herself wept the first day. She was used to the sound of fighting in 
Winterfell
, but knowing it was real—with
angry shouts and the moans of dying men—was different. At first she pleaded for news and to see someone familiar,
such as her father or her 
gallant prince
, but she got no answer. Then they shoved Jeyne into the room and she
claimed they were killing everyone and that there were bodies on the steps. The next day the fighting was over and
Lannister
 guardsmen patrolled the walls. The servants who bring them food and clothes refused to answer any
questions. At sunset they heard the bells tolling from the 
Great Sept of Baelor
 proclaiming King 
Robert
’s death.
Sansa is afraid for her beautiful prince and her father and at night she dreams of Joffrey on the throne with her
beside him with everyone she knows coming before them to bend their knee.
Ser 
Boros Blount
 comes for her on the third day. Resolved to be a lady no matter what, Sansa complements the ugly
knight. He leads her out of Maegor’s Holdfast, where she sees a body impaled on the spikes of the dry moat. Rather
than being taken to the queen’s apartments, Sansa is brought to the council chamber and presented to Queen Cersei
and the 
small council
, though her prince is not there as she was hoping.
The queen asks if she has been well taken care of and Sansa affirms that they have, though no one will tell them
what happened. Sansa's use of the word "us" leads to confusion until Sansa explains that Jeyne is staying with her.
Cersei is surprised to discover that Jeyne has been put in with Sansa and expresses concern about what absurd tales
Jeyne might have told Sansa. Remembering her promise, Sansa asks about Vayon Poole, unable to imagine anyone
killing a steward who does not even carry a sword. Cersei asks what to do with Jeyne and 
Littlefinger
 states that he
will find a place for her. The queen then instructs that Jeyne be taken to Littlefinger’s apartments and that saying
Littlefinger will take her to her father should calm her down. Sansa asks where Vayon is and where Jeyne is being
sent, wondering why Littlefinger must be involved, but Cersei brushes off the question.
Cersei tells Sansa that Joffrey loves her, but that her father is a traitor. Varys and Pycelle explain that Lord Eddard,
who had sworn to protect King Robert’s children, was planning to turn the kingdom over to 
Stannis Baratheon
. Then
Cersei shows Sansa the letter her father wrote to Stannis, which has been taken off 
the captain of his guard
. Sansa
insists that it cannot be true because her father was the king’s friend.
Cersei informs Sansa that she cannot allow the daughter of a traitor to marry her son. Sansa is overwhelmed by the
unfairness of taking away her beloved because of something her father did. Cersei states that she knew Sansa was
innocent from the moment Sansa came to her with Lord Eddard’s plan to take her away. Sansa insists that she did
this because she loves Joffrey, remembering that she felt very wicked sneaking away to the queen. She had wanted

to go to the king, but loud and often drunk King Robert had always frightened her. She had also believed the king
would probably have just sent her back to her father. After having informed the queen of her father’s plans, Sansa
was locked in the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast, under guard. A few hours later the fighting had started.
The small council discusses whether Sansa could also turn out to be traitorous. 
Varys
 and 
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
opine that the child of a traitor is also likely to become traitorous. Littlefinger points out that Sansa reminds him of
her mother
 rather than her father. Queen Cersei expresses doubt that Sansa can be trusted since 
her sister
 turned her
wolf on Joffrey. Sansa replies that she is nothing like her traitorous sister; she only wants to be Joffrey’s wife.
Queen Cersei then suggests that if the rest of Sansa's kin prove loyal it would rest some of the council’s fears.
Therefore, Cersei asks that Sansa write to her lady mother and her brother 
Robb
 explaining how Lord Eddard
betrayed his king. Sansa does not know what to say, but Cersei assures her that they will provide her with the words.
The important thing is that the 
Starks
 keep the King’s Peace; otherwise it will go hard on them and on Sansa. Sansa
is also told write that she is being well cared for and that her family must come to 
King's Landing
 and pledge fealty
to Joffrey.
Sansa asks to see her father, but is told that if she is truly loyal she should not want to see him. Sansa says she is
concerned about him and what will happen to him. She is told that her father is well and that the king will decide his
punishment. Sansa realizes that the king is now her gallant Joffrey, whom she knows would never hurt her father
and who is sure to listen to her pleas. Perhaps her father will only be exiled for a few years. However, if her mother
or Robb did something treasonous it will all go wrong.
Sansa agrees to write the letters and ends up writing four: to her mother, her brother Robb, her 
Aunt Lysa
, and her
grandfather 
Hoster Tully
. When she returns to her room, Jeyne and her belongings are already gone. It is only when
she is drifting off to sleep that night that Sansa realizes she has forgotten to ask about Arya.

The bodies of two men that accompanied 
Benjen Stark
 are found. Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
 blames 
wildlings
, but 
Sam
points out odd characteristics about the bodies. Back at 
Castle Black
, 
Jon
 learns that King 
Robert
 is dead and that 
his
father
 is charged with treason. At dinner that night, Ser 
Alliser Thorne
 mocks Jon and his father, and Jon attacks
him. That night Jon finds the 
wight
 of one of the dead men in the 
Lord Commander’s
 room. Jon kills the monster,
saving the Lord Commander.
Synopsis
With the hounds being useless, 
Ghost
 has led the party to the bodies of two rangers. The area makes both the hounds
and the horses nervous and even 
Jon
 feels uncomfortable. Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
 identifies the bodies as 
Othor
 and
Jafer Flowers
, two of 
Benjen Stark
’s men. It was Jafer’s right hand that Ghost brought to Jon in the 
weirwood
 grove.
The corpse’s remaining hand is as black as the cloak he wears. Both of the corpses have the same pale skin, black
hands, and staring blue eyes.
Remarking that they are only two of the six men that Benjen took with him, 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
 asks Ser
Jaremy how two men could die so close to 
the Wall
 without the rangers knowing; Othor even wears a hunting horn.
Ser Jaremy insists that no horn was blown or it would have been heard. He goes on to complain that he does not
have sufficient men to patrol and mentions the Lord Commander’s own order to stay close to the Wall following
Benjen’s disappearance.
Mormont asks how the men died. A quick examination shows that Jafer was killed by an axe blow to the neck and
that Othor is riddled with wounds. The old forester 
Dywen
 suggests that Othor was known to carry an axe. Ser
Jaremy points out that 
wildlings
 carry axes as well, suggesting it to be the work of 
Mance Rayder
, which Mormont
finds questionable so close to the Wall. Ser Jaremy asks who else it could have been. Jon knows the answer, they all
do, but 
the Others
 have been gone for 8,000 years if they ever existed at all.
Mormont declares that if Benjen had been attacked so close to 
Castle Black
, he would have returned for more men
before going after the attackers. Ser Jaremy suggests that, sometime in the six months that Benjen has been gone, his
party might have been attacked by wildlings and that Othor and Jafer were only the last survivors. To support this
claim, the knight points out that the two bodies cannot have been dead for more than a day.
Sam
 now speaks up. The fat boy is present to be the eyes of blind old Maester 
Aemon
, but Jon had to force the
cowardly boy to even look at the bodies. Now Sam insists that Ser Jaremy is wrong about the bodies. At the Lord
Commander’s urging, Sam points out that the blood in the corpses’ veins is dry and crusty, as if they have been dead
for a long time. However, the bodies do not stink and have not begun to decompose; they are also untouched by
maggots or scavengers. Suspicious of the untouched nature of the corpses, Mormont orders 
Chett
 to bring one of the
hounds closer, but no matter how hard he tries, the hound fights to stay away from the bodies. In addition, Sam
points out that there are no pools of blood to indicate the men were killed there, indicating that the bodies have been
moved. The old forester Dywen and Ser Jaremy also note that they do not recall either Othor or Jafer having blue
eyes.
Several of the other rangers urge that the bodies should be burned, but the Lord Commander wants Maester Aemon

to examine them further. It proves impossible to tie the bodies to the horses, who panic at their proximity to the
corpses, so they are carried back on crude slings.
Lord Commander Mormont orders Ser Jaremy to search the area for ten leagues around, using hunters and foresters
if he does not have enough men. If Benjen or any more of his men are around he will have them found, and if there
is anyone else around, he will have them found as well.
As they ride back, Jon follows the Lord Commander and finds that it is too warm, with the Wall weeping copiously.
This weather is called by the old men “Sprit Summer,” when the season is giving up its ghosts. This means that
winter is coming, and a long summer means a long winter. Jon now thinks back to the stories that 
Old Nan
 told of
the Others coming riding in the dark and everything, including cities, falling before them and how they feed their
servants on the flesh of human children.
When they finally see the Wall, Lord Commander Mormont calls for Sam and compliments him, telling him that he
is fat but not stupid.
When they arrive at the gate, the Lord Commander is told by 
Bowen Marsh
, the Lord Steward, that there has been a
raven. Mormont orders the bodies put in a storage room. Meanwhile, Jon notices everyone is looking at him and
knows something is wrong. Jon searches out his friends and 
Pyp
 tells him that King 
Robert
 is dead. Jon wonders if
his father will now return to 
Winterfell
 and decides that when he visits he will ask for the truth about his mother. His
friends ask about the bodies, but Jon only says they were queer.
As he walks to the Lord Commander’s Tower Jon notices the stares again, and when he arrives he is told that
Mormont wants to see him. When he enters, Mormont surprises him with an offer of wine and asks him to sit. Jon
states that it is grievous news about his father and the king which Mormont confirms. The Lord Commander tells
Jon that it is said that the king loved to hunt and that the things we love destroy us every time. He then states that if
it had not been for the love a woman, his son 
Jorah
 would not have thought to sell poachers into slavery. Jon does
not understand, but the Lord Commander gives no answer, only a repeated order to sit and drink.
Jon is told that his father has been imprisoned as a traitor for plotting with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to
Prince Joffrey
. Jon denies that his father could ever be a traitor, but then recalls that he fathered a bastard; where was
the honor in that? The Lord Commander explains that he plans to use his contacts in 
King's Landing
 to ensure that
Eddard is allowed to take the black; they could use men of Eddard’s ability on the Wall. Jon thinks that it would be a
terrible injustice to strip his father of 
Winterfell
 but knows it would be preferable to death. Then he remembers
Joffrey mocking 
Robb Stark
 and Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, and asks if the king will listen. Mormont replies that Joffrey
may listen to 
his mother
, though it is too bad 
Tyrion Lannister
 is not there. Mormont declares it a bad thing that
Jon’s “mother” took Tyrion captive, but Jon haughtily reminds him that 
Catelyn Stark
 is not his mother. Jon then
asks about his sisters and Mormont promises to ask about them. Then Mormont states that he hopes Jon is not going
to do anything stupid; his duty is now here and his old life ended when he took the black. He then dismisses Jon,
telling him that he can help write the letter the next day.
Despite Mormont’s words, Jon remains convinced the Starks are his family and wonders how it cannot be his
concern. He also wonders whether his father could truly be a traitor. At the evening meal Jon realizes that everyone
knows about his father’s arrest. When his friends rally to him and assure him that they do not believe the stories, Jon
realizes that they are now his brothers as much as Robb and 
Bran
 and 
Rickon
. Then Jon hears Ser 
Alliser
 mocking
both Jon and his father. In the blink of an eye, Jon jumps over the table and attacks Ser Alliser with a knife, but his
friends hold him back and he is marched to his sleeping cell. Later, Mormont visits him and reminds Jon that he told
him not to do anything stupid. Now the high officers must meet to decide his fate. A guard is left at his door, and his
friends are not permitted to visit him, though Ghost is allowed to stay.
That night, Jon wakes to Ghost scratching at the door, and it is very cold. When he opens his door, Jon finds his door
guard dead and he hears noises coming from the Lord Commander’s chamber. Taking the dead guard’s sword, Jon
ascends to the Lord Commander's chamber where he finds the door open and 
Mormont's raven
 squawking. He sees
the shadow of a man in black with icy blue eyes going into the Lord Commander’s sleeping chamber.
Ghost attacks the man, and Jon pulls down the curtains so that he can see. The man has his black hands around
Ghost’s throat. Jon cuts off an arm with his sword and Ghost is able to wrench free. The next stroke cuts halfway

through the man’s face, and now Jon recognizes Othor. The severed hand claws at his calf and Jon pulls it off. Ghost
attacks the hand while Jon strikes the undead man in the neck, but Othor slams into him, knocking him down. In the
fall, Jon loses his sword. Othor is on top of Jon and attempting to choke him, but is finally pulled off by Ghost. As
he regains his feet, Jon spots the Lord Commander standing naked in the doorway with an oil lamp as the hand
approaches him. Jon grabs the oil lamp from the Lord Commander and throws it on the drapes, setting them afire.
Then Jon grabs the burning drapes and throws them onto Othor, praying that the 
wight
 will burn.

Bran
 watches the 
Karstarks
 arrive, then goes to the 
godswood
 to pray. He is interrupted by 
Osha
, who tells him
about the 
old gods
 and the 
Others
. She insists that 
Robb
 should be marching north not south. Bran passes on her
advice to Maester 
Luwin
. Then Robb marches his army south.
Synopsis
Bran
 watches from a guard turret with 
Maester
 
Luwin
’s fareye as the 
Karstark
 forces arrive at 
Winterfell
. When
Robb
 heard the news that 
their father
 had been taken captive in 
King's Landing
, he called the Stark bannermen
together for war. The Karstarks are the last to arrive: three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot lead by
Lord 
Rickard Karstark
 with his sons 
Harrion
, 
Eddard
, and 
Torrhen
 riding beside him. The Karstarks are said to have
Stark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but the fierce men do not look like Starks to Bran.
Bran has not been allowed to leave the castle since the 
incident
 in the 
wolfswood
. Robb insists that there are no men
available to guard him and is not dissuaded by Bran’s argument that 
Summer
 will protect him. The incident in the
Wolfswood shames Bran as he is not able to protect himself; even 
Rickon
 would have been able to kick them. A
year ago he would have visited the village anyway, climbing over the walls, but now he can only watch with
Maester Luwin and 
Hodor
.
Maester Luwin has taught Bran all the banners and now he has faces to associate with them. Bran asks how many
knights there are and Luwin tells Bran that there are over 12,000 men, but only 300 knights because 
the North
 holds
to the 
old gods
 and knights are anointed in a sept of the 
Faith of the Seven
. However, Luwin assures him, "a man’s
worth is not marked by a 
ser
 before his name." Bran asks when they will leave and is told they must leave soon or
the countryside will be eaten clean. Robb has a long way to go and the fighting has started. More men will join Robb
as he travels south.
Bran tells Hodor that he does not want to watch anymore. Maester Luwin reminds Bran that his brother is busy
greeting the Karstarks, but Bran assures him that he wants to visit the 
godswood
. Hodor now carries Bran in a basket
strapped to his back, an idea Luwin got from the baskets used by the serving women to carry firewood. Being
carried this way does not shame Bran the same as being carried like a baby, although Hodor sometimes forgets Bran
is on his back when going through doorways.
When Bran exits the castle there are Karstark men arriving. Some men mock him, but Bran has been warned of this
by the maester. His attitude is to let them mock since he does not want to stay in his bedroom. Bran calls for
Summer, and the Karstark horses reel as the 
direwolf
 goes by.
When Bran arrives in the godswood, he pulls himself out of his seat on Hodor’s back using a branch of the
weirwood
. Then he lets Hodor lower him down beside the water and says he wants to be alone with Summer. Bran
has been finding himself drawn more to the 
heart tree
 and now he takes comfort from its deep red eyes; the old gods
are watching over him. He feels safe and it gives him time to think, which he has been doing a lot of recently.
Bran prays for Robb not to go away, for the safety of his family, and for 
Rickon
 to understand. Rickon has grown
wild and violent since he learned that Robb was leaving. Once Rickon disappeared and, when he was finally found

down in the crypts, the youngest Stark had slashed at the men with a sword and 
Shaggydog
 bit 
Gage
 on the arm and
took a chunk out of 
Mikken
’s thigh. It took Robb and 
Grey Wind
 to bring Shaggydog under control. After that
Farlen
 chained Shaggydog in the kennels and now Rickon cries even more.
Luwin and Bran have both asked Robb to stay but he refuses, saying he has no choice. Bran believes this is only half
a lie because Robb could send someone else to guard 
the Neck
. Robb’s response was that their father would not send
others to die while he stayed behind the walls of Winterfell. Robb denies all who request being given supreme battle
command. Many of the lords try to test Robb by making demands, but he is able to handle them much as his father
did and bend them to his will, even when anger flares. When 
Greatjon Umber
 demanded the right to command, he
drew his sword against Robb. 
Grey Wind
 immediately reacted by biting off two of his fingers. Since the incident,
the Greatjon has been Robb’s staunchest supporter. That night, Robb came to Bran’s bedchamber pale and shaken.
Robb also told Bran that the most frightening bannerman is 
Roose Bolton
, who never says a word but only looks at
him. When Bolton does this, all Robb can think of is the room in the 
Dreadfort
 where the Boltons hang the skins of
their enemies. Bran states that this is only a story of 
Old Nan
’s, but then asks for confirmation.
There are many horrible stories that come with travelers, and it is impossible to say which is real, although some are
obviously untrue. Then the letter from Sansa arrived with the seal of House Stark. After Robb had read the letter he
crushed it. Sansa had said nothing of Arya and Robb asked what is wrong with her. Bran replied that Sansa has lost
her wolf, remembering the day four of the guardsmen returned with bones of 
Lady
. They buried the bones in the
cemetery with the faithful servants of Winterfell; she went south and only her bones returned, like Lord 
Rickard
Stark
, 
Brandon Stark
, and two hundred men, and none returned. Now 
their father
, 
Arya
, 
Sansa
, 
Jory Cassel
, and 
Fat
Tom
 have gone south and not come back and later 
mother
 and Ser 
Rodrik
 left and have not come back. Now Robb is
going south and it frightens Bran. Bran prays that the gods look after Robb and his men going south, and that they
defeat the 
Lannisters
 and bring Father back.
Bran is surprised by words from 
Osha
 who is apparently able to move quietly in the shackles she has to wear. She
tells him that she can hear the gods answering him. When Summer comes around the pool to sniff her, she flinches.
Bran calls Summer back and asks Osha, whom he has not seen since she was taken captive, what she is doing here.
The 
spearwife
 replies they are her gods too and the only gods beyond 
the Wall
. Bran notes that she looks more
womanly with her longer hair and her dress of brown roughspun. She tells Bran that 
Gage
 lets her out to do her
prayers from time to time while she lets him do what he wants under her skirt when he feels the need; it is nothing to
her, she likes the smell of flour on his hands and he is gentler than 
Stiv
.
She offers to leave but Bran asks her to stay and tell him what she means about hearing the gods. She tells him to
open his ears, to which Bran replies that it is only the wind. Osha asks him who sends the winds, insisting that the
old gods can see him and hear his words. Bran asks what they say and Osha replies that they are sad because they
cannot help his brother in the South. The old gods have no power there because all the weirwoods were destroyed
thousands of years ago; they cannot watch over his brother because they have no eyes.
Now Bran listens and it seems there is sadness in the wind, but then he only hears Hodor, who arrives naked from
his bath in the hot springs. When Osha sees Hodor she declares that his size denotes 
giant
 blood in him. When Bran
tells her that Maester Luwin taught him that there are no more giants, Osha tells him that the Maester should ride
beyond the 
Wall
. The giants sometimes breed with men 
beyond the Wall
, producing half-breeds, though it goes
much worse on the women that have sex with a giant. She then asks Bran if he knows what she is talking about and
he tells her does, as he has seen animals mating.
As Hodor leaves to dress at Bran’s command, Bran admits that he is very big. Osha confirms there are giants beyond
the Wall, and worse than giants: when men leave their fires they often do not come back, or sometimes they come
back as 
wights
 with blue eyes and cold black hands. Osha explains that she tried to tell Robb, Maester Luwin, and
even 
Theon Greyjoy
 of this, but they would not listen. She asks Bran why else she would flee south in the company
of Stiv and the rest of those fools. She goes on to declare that 
Mance Rayder
, once a sworn brother of the 
Night's
Watch
, thinks he can fight the wights. Osha states that she, unlike Mance, is of the north, from a long line of the 
free
folk
. Osha laments again that she cannot get Robb to listen and Bran suggests that perhaps Robb will listen to him.
Osha is dubious but gives Bran the message:
You tell him this, m’lord. You tell him he’s bound on marching the wrong way. It's north he should be taking
his swords. North, not south.

Bran does not get to tell his brother this, because Robb takes his meal in the solar with the great lords to make final
plans for the march, while Bran has to act as the host to the Karstarks in the 
Great Hall
. When he arrives in the hall,
Bran can feel the eyes on him and hears them murmuring about him being broken. He whispers under his breath that
he wants to be a knight, which Maester Luwin overhears. He tells Bran that some call his order the “knights of the
mind,” and that Bran could forge a maester’s chain at the 
Citadel
 in 
Oldtown
. Bran states that he wants to learn
magic and that the 
crow
 promised he would fly. The maester says he can teach Bran many things but no one can
teach him magic. Bran replies that the 
children of the forest
 could teach him. Then he remembers what he promised
Osha, and tells the maester of the threat in the north. The maester promises to talk to Osha, but it is obvious even to
Bran that what he has said has made little impression.
Two days later, Robb and his army march south. Robb tells Bran that now he must be the lord, the Stark in
Winterfell. Bran—who has never felt so little, alone, or scared—does not know how to be a lord. He is told to listen
to Maester Luwin and to take care of Rickon who has refused to say goodbye, claiming that no one ever comes back.
Robb states that Mother will be home soon and promises to bring Father back. As Robb’s force leaves, Bran
remembers Osha’s words: he is marching the wrong way. Then he hears the cheers from the village, and thinks they
will never cheer for him. All that seems to be left in Winterfell are women, children, old men, and Hodor.

Daenerys VII
Daenerys
 is unable to convince 
Khal
 
Drogo
 to assault the 
Seven Kingdoms
 to regain her throne. While Drogo is
hunting, Daenerys goes to the market where a wine merchant offers her a cask of wine. When Ser 
Jorah
 insists that
the merchant drink first, the merchant refuses and attempts to flee. When Drogo learns of the attempt to poison
Daenerys, he makes the decision to attack the Seven Kingdoms.
Synopsis
After taking his pleasure, 
Khal
 
Drogo
 arises from the sleeping mats and declares that the 
Stallion Who Mounts the
World
 has no need of an 
iron chair
. 
Daenerys
 reminds him that it is prophesized that the Stallion will ride to the ends
of the earth, but Drogo responds that the earth ends at the black salt sea, which no horse can drink. Daenerys tries to
explain ships to him, but Drogo is not interested and leaves to go hunting. She can only hope that if his hunting goes
well he might return in a more receptive mood; maybe he will even kill a 
hrakkar
, the white lion of the plains.
Although he is brave even by Dothraki standards, like all his people Drogo still fears the sea.
Daenerys sends for Ser 
Jorah
. When he arrives, she pleads for help convincing her husband to ride west. Ser Jorah
explains that Drogo has never seen the 
Seven Kingdoms
 and probably thinks of them as small islands like 
Lys
 or
Lorath
; the riches of the east seem a lot more tempting. He continues that she should have patience and not make 
her
brother
’s mistake. Ser Jorah promises that eventually they will go home. The word “home” saddens her when she
remembers that the Seven Kingdoms are a place she has never seen either, and she wonders if the 
dosh khaleen
 is
her future.
In an attempt to cheer her up, Ser Jorah asks if she would like visit the 
Western Market
, where a great caravan has
just arrived and may carry a letter from Magister 
Illyrio
. Daenerys likes this idea since it will be nice to see the
treasures, to hear the sound of the 
Valyrian
 language, and (since Drogo is gone) to travel in a litter; she does not
want to appear weak in front of her husband by not riding a horse.
Daenerys finds the market quiet compared to the bazaars of the 
Free Cities
. The caravans come from east and west
not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other. The Dothraki do not fully understand the concept of
buying and selling, but the merchants are welcome as long as they do not disturb the peace or profane the 
Mother of
Mountains
 and give the traditional gifts to the 
dosh khaleen
. Daenerys enjoys the wonder and magic of the 
Eastern
Market
, with its strange foods and people, but the Western Market reminds her of home. She tells Ser Jorah about
how she loved to play in the bazaars of the Free Cities when she was a little girl even though they seldom had
money to buy anything. She especially remembers the honeyfinger cakes of 
Tyrosh
. When she asks if they have
such cakes in the Seven Kingdoms, Ser Jorah is unable to say.
Ser Jorah asks her pardon to seek out the merchant captain to ask about letters from Illyrio, but when Daenerys
offers to join him he is insistent that he go alone. Daenerys finds this curious and wonders if the knight plans to visit
a brothel afterwards. Daenerys wanders joyfully around for half of the morning, even laughing for the first time
since her brother’s death. As per Dothraki custom she receives several items as gifts and reciprocates with
medallions from her belt.
Turning a corner, they come upon a wine merchant offering thimbles of wines. Daenerys accepts a taste of the wine,

speaking in Valyrian, which surprises the merchant, until 
Doreah
 steps up to declare all of Daenerys’ titles. The
merchant immediately insists that the wine he was going to offer her is not worthy of a princess and offers her a cask
of his finest wine. Daenerys graciously accepts the cask, knowing that Drogo has acquired a taste for fine wine from
his time in the Free Cities.
As Daenerys is ordering the cask taken back to the litter, Ser Jorah appears and states he wants a taste of the wine.
The wine merchant resists, insisting that Ser Jorah is not fit for such wine, but relents and pours two cups when Ser
Jorah threatens him. Then Ser Jorah orders the merchant to drink. Instead, the merchant throws the cask at Daenerys
and flees. Ser Jorah pushes Daenerys out of the way and Doreah just barely catches her before she falls on her
pregnant belly. 
Jhogo
 uses his whip to trip the merchant. The ruckus brings a dozen caravan guards and the
merchant captain running. The merchant captain seems to guess what has happened. He orders the merchant taken
away to await Khal Drogo and gives the merchant’s goods to Daenerys as a gift. Daenerys asks Ser Jorah how he
knew but the knight insists that he only suspected because the letter from Magister Illyrio had made him fearful. As
they return, Daenerys notes that her baby is moving restlessly and she comforts him with words about being the
blood of the dragon.
When they get back to the hollow hummock that serves as her home, Daenerys orders the rest to leave her with Ser
Jorah. The knight explains that the letter from Magister Illyrio brings news that 
the Usurper
 has offered lands and a
lordship to anyone that kills Daenerys and her child or her brother. Daenerys observes, with a laughing sob, that the
Usurper owes Drogo a lordship for killing Viserys.
Daenerys then thinks that the Usurper has woken her dragon and looks over to her dragon eggs. She commands Ser
Jorah to light the brazier despite the heat and then asks him to leave. She then pushes the eggs under the coals,
wondering if she is destroying the eggs. Nothing happens and Daenerys is very disappointed, but wonders even to
herself what she was expecting.
Drogo returns with the carcass of a 
hrakkar
 as the stars come out. After he has told her that he will make her a cloak
of its skin, Daenerys tells him what has happened. Drogo becomes very quiet as Ser Jorah tells him that this will not
be the last attempt. For their roles in saving his 
khaleesi
, Drogo gives Ser Jorah and Jhogo their choice of his horses.
Drogo also proclaims a gift for his unborn son, 
Rhaego
: the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Drogo then swears to the
Mother of Mountains that he will take his 
khalasar
 west and ride the wooden horses to Westeros to kill the men in
the iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He vows to rape their women, take their children as slaves, and to
bring their broken gods back to 
Vaes Dothrak
 to bow beneath the Mother of Mountains.
Two days later, the 
khalasar
 leaves Vaes Dothrak, headed southwest. The wine seller is forced to run naked, chained
behind Daenerys’ silver. No harm will come to the man, so long as he keeps up.

Catelyn IX
Catelyn
 and Ser 
Brynden Tully
 meet 
Robb
’s army at 
Moat Cailin
, accompanied by the host from 
House Manderly
.
In private, Catelyn helps Robb refine his war plans and explains to him that they have no option but to win or die.
Robb decides to go south in support of 
Riverrun
 with a feint down the 
kingsroad
 to keep Lord 
Tywin Lannister
’s
force occupied.
Synopsis
As they approach 
Moat Cailin
, the ancient fortress of the 
First Men
 which guards 
the Neck
, 
Catelyn
 is relieved that
they are not too late. She is accompanied by Ser 
Brynden Tully
 and Ser 
Wylis
 and Ser 
Wendel
 
Manderly
 with their
1,500 men, including 20 knights and 200 mounted men. Their father, Lord 
Wyman Manderly
—who is too fat to sit a
horse—has remained to see to the defenses of 
White Harbor
 but sent his two stout sons, who would have been the
fattest men Catelyn had ever seen if she had not met their father.
Ser Brynden, upon seeing the fortress, thinks it is a deathtrap. Most of the ancient fortress has long since rotted away
leaving only 3 out of 20 towers. Catelyn reassures him that, according to 
her husband
, it is more formidable than it
seems. The 
three
 
remaining
 
towers
 command the only causeway across the impenetrable bogs of the Neck; to
assault any one of the towers an enemy must wade through waist-deep muck and 
lizard-lion
-infested moats then
climb the moss-covered towers while exposed to attack from the other two towers. In addition, there are also
supposed to be cold, vengeful ghosts of 
the North
 that hunger for southron blood. Ser Brynden jests that he, as a
southron, should not linger in this place.
Catelyn heads for the 
Gatehouse Tower
, understanding the lone 
Stark
 banner to mean that 
Robb
 has made his seat
there. She arrives to find Robb surrounded by his father’s bannermen in a drafty hall. At first, Robb does not notice
Catelyn, but his 
wolf
 does. After his bannermen fall quiet, her son looks up and is happy to see her. Each of the lords
pay their respects to her, 
Theon Greyjoy
 being the last. He expresses surprise at Catelyn’s presence, so she explains
that she learned Robb had called the banners when she came ashore at White Harbor. She then introduces the
Manderly brothers and her uncle.
When Robb asks, Catelyn explains that she has sent Ser 
Rodrik
 back to 
Winterfell
 to act as 
castellan
 and to assist
Maester
 
Luwin
 in military matters. After some of the lords give Catelyn reassurance that Winterfell is safe, Lord
Roose Bolton
 states that it is rumored she holds 
Tyrion Lannister
, who would be a good hostage. Catelyn admits she
lost the dwarf because the gods saw fit to free him with help from 
her sister
. Speaking of Lysa, Catelyn recalls that
before leaving the 
Eyrie
, she attempted to convince her sister to let her take 
Robert Arryn
 as a fosterling, but Lysa’s
rage had been frightening.
Catelyn then sends the bannermen and Theon away to speak to Robb alone. Once they are gone, Catelyn notes that
her son looks older, especially with his new beard. Catelyn, who is afraid for her son, notes to Robb that he is only
fifteen and leading a host to war. Robb insists that there was no one else. Catelyn argues that he could have given
command to any of the bannermen, or even Theon, although he would not have been her choice. Robb responds that
none of them are Starks. Catelyn then reminds Robb that he was fighting with wooden swords less than a year ago.
Robb’s eyes flare with anger, but he softens and asks if she is sending him back to Winterfell. Catelyn explains that
she cannot do such a thing; if she did, the bannermen would lose respect for him, which would hurt him when he

becomes Lord of Winterfell one day. Robb’s relief is obvious.
Robb asks if Catelyn knows about Lord Eddard's capture and she says she does; 
Robert
's sudden death and Eddard’s
fall scared her greatly. Catelyn asks about the girls and Robb tells her that letters addressed to each of them from
Sansa
 arrived at Winterfell. Robb returns with a crumpled parchment and hands it to her. She reads it with concern
giving way to disbelief, then to anger, and then to fear. She exclaims that it is 
Cersei’s
 letter, and that they have
Sansa hostage and mean to keep her. Robb points out that there is no mention of 
Arya
 and that he was hoping that
Catelyn still held Tyrion to exchange for his sisters.
Robb then asks about the knights of 
the Vale
 and is told that Lysa will do nothing; only one knight of the Vale will
ride to war: the best, Ser Brynden Tully. Robb asks Catelyn what they are going to do with the 18,000 men he does
have. Catelyn can tell that Robb is caught in indecision, which will not do. Knowing he is worried about his father
and sisters, Catelyn explains to her son that if he goes to 
King's Landing
 to bend the knee he will never be allowed
to leave, and if he retreats to Winterfell his lords will lose respect for him. In either case, Cersei can then do as she
likes to her captives without fear. Their only hope is that Robb can defeat the 
Lannisters
 in the field; Cersei cannot
harm her captives because she will need them as hostages if things go against her. However, if Robb loses there is
no hope for any of them and they will suffer the fate of the 
Targaryen children
; there is naught but stone at the heart
of 
Casterly Rock
. Robb states that that makes it simple: he will not lose.
Catelyn then asks about the situation in the 
Riverlands
. Robb informs her that 
the war
 has begun. A fortnight past,
Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 
smashed
 the 
Tully
 force led by Lords 
Vance
 and 
Piper
 at the 
Golden Tooth
 and is now
advancing on 
Riverrun
. Meanwhile, Lord 
Tywin Lannister
 has come up from the south with an even larger army.
This army 
ambushed
 the party of Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
 sent to bring Gregor Clegane to justice, killing 
Raymun
Darry
 and most of the men from Winterfell. Lord Beric may have escaped, but no one knows for sure. Now Lord
Tywin is marching north to 
Harrenhal
, burning as he goes.
The news is worse than Catelyn imagined. She asks Robb if he plans to await Lord Tywin’s army at Moat Cailin,
but Robb says that no one thinks that Tywin will be stupid enough to come that far; instead he will take the castles
of the river lords one by one. Robb believes that they should march south to meet him. Catelyn questions the idea of
leaving their strong position at Moat Cailin, fearing that her son has no chance against seasoned battle commanders
like Tywin and Jaime Lannister. Robb explains that his supplies are running low and that an army the size of his
cannot live off this land forever; now that Lord Manderly’s force has arrived, they need to march. Catelyn realizes
the truth in what Robb says, remembering that Robb’s is not a standing army, but a levy of fishermen and farmers
that will not stay cohesive if left idle.
Declaring that marching is all well and good, Catelyn asks Robb where he plans on marching 
to
. Again Robb is
uncertain; the Greatjon believes they should take the battle to Lord Tywin, while others think they should join with
Ser 
Edmure Tully
 to defend Riverrun. Catelyn tells her son that, since he appointed himself battle commander, he
must command; he cannot appear indecisive in front of his lords.
Catelyn asks Robb again what he intends to do. He declares that both plans have their merits, but he does not think a
commander as experienced as Lord Tywin will be easily surprised and his forces are too strong to defeat easily.
Robb decides to have his infantry continue down the 
Kingsroad
 but to send his horse across the 
Green Fork
 and then
south to relieve Riverrun. This will put the river between his two forces but also between Tywin and Jaime.
However, the only available crossing of the Green Fork is at 
the Twins
, which is controlled by 
House Frey
.
Although a bannerman to 
House Tully
, Lord 
Walder Frey
 has never been the most loyal; all Catelyn can think of is
that the “Late” Lord Frey failed to arrive at the 
Battle of the Trident
 until after the battle was done. She tells Robb
that 
her father
 has never trusted Lord Walder and that he should not either.
Catelyn, impressed by Robb’s plan, asks who will command each force. Robb informs her of his plan to lead the
mounted force to Riverrun himself, while command of his main army of foot soldiers moving south to intercept
Lord Tywin will be given to the Greatjon. In an attempt to show Robb his error, Catelyn points out that his father
considered the Greatjon one of his most fearless men, but that his father is not fearless; he is brave, but that is
different. Robb reconsiders and decides he needs a man of caution and cold cunning to lead the main force. Robb
realizes that he should put 
Roose Bolton
, whose cold cunning scares even him, in command; hopefully Bolton will
scare Lord Tywin as well.

Robb states that he wants Catelyn to return to Winterfell. She insists that her father is dying and her brother is
surrounded by foes; her place is with them at Riverrun.

Tyrion VIII
Tyrion
 meets 
his father’s
 army at the 
inn at the crossroads
, escorted by 300 
Vale mountain clansmen
. Tyrion and
Lord Tywin are discussing their war plans when Tyrion’s clansmen burst in, but Tywin handles them coolly. When
news arrives that 
Robb Stark
’s host is advancing, Tywin offers rich rewards to the clansmen if they fight for him.
Synopsis
Chella
 of the 
Black Ears
 is the one who locates 
Lord Tywin
’s army, which she deduces to be 20,000 men. 
Tyrion
has gathered a force of over 300 
mountain clansmen
 and 
Gunthor son of Gurn
 is collecting more. He wonders what
his father will make of his little army, since he is not sure what to make of them himself.
Tyrion wants to meet his father without the clansmen, but 
Ulf son of Umar
 expresses distrust and 
Shagga
 insists that
he will go with the “boyman,” and if he lies Tyrion will lose his manhood. Tyrion is forced to quickly give in to the
demands of his captor-followers (he’s still not sure which they are) and selects representatives from each clan to
accompany him. As a parting jibe, he asks the remaining clansmen to try not to kill each other while he is gone.
Tyrion dislikes having to work with the clans because they think everyone’s voice should be heard in council, which
causes them to argue endlessly.
When they come to the first strongpoint, which Tyrion approaches alone, the captain recognizes Tyrion and gives
them an escort. They travel past burned land and buildings. There are many carrion birds, although there are no
bodies. When they arrive at the guarded camp containing hundreds of campfires, they are met by a party led by Ser
Flement Brax
, who is surprised to see Tyrion. He tells Tyrion that his father has taken the 
inn at the crossroads
 as his
headquarters, which Tyrion finds a fitting full-circle to his 
unpleasant abduction
.
As they pass the many banners, Tyrion guesses that Chella’s count cannnot be far wrong. He also notes that his
clansmen are awed, which pleases him; the more impressed they are by the power of 
House Lannister
 the easier they
will be to control. When they arrive at the inn, Tyrion is pleased to see the body of the innkeepter 
Masha Heddle
rotting in a gibbet. When the stableboys emerge hesitantly to take their horses, Shagga is suspicious but Tyrion is
able to convince him. House guards at the door direct Tyrion to his father in the common room.
Lord Tywin Lannister is sharing ale with his brother, Ser 
Kevan Lannister
. Kevan sees Tyrion first and expresses
surprise, but Tywin only remarks that the rumors of his demise were unfounded. Tyrion tells his father that he is
sorry to disappoint him, feeling uncomfortable with his deformities under his father’s gaze. He quickly covers his
discomfort with a quip that he is thankful they started a war for his sake. His father takes the opportunity to chastise
Tyrion for going meekly with 
a woman
; his brother 
Jaime
 would not have gone without a fight. Tyrion replies that
Jaime is also taller.
Lord Tywin then explains that Lannister honor demanded they go to war after Tyrion was captured. Tyrion asks
them how that 
war
 is going. His father explains that Jaime has been covering himself in glory, 
smashing
 the forces
of Lords 
Piper
 and 
Vance
 at the 
Golden Tooth
 and pushing on to 
defeat
 the main 
Tully
 forces outside 
Riverrun
 and
capture 
Edmure Tully
. Lord 
Blackwood
 has fallen back to hold Riverrun against Jaime, but the other 
river lords
have dispersed to their own lands. Many of these lords have now fallen one by one to Lord Tywin’s army, leaving
only the 
Freys
 and 
Mallisters
 to oppose them. Lord Tywin in not concerned; he knows that 
Walder Frey
 will not

bestir himself until the winner is clear and 
Jason Mallister
 lacks the strength to stand alone. The only real threat is
that the 
Starks
 or 
Arryns
 will interfere.
Tyrion tells them they need not worry about the Arryns, but the Starks are another matter. He is informed of 
Eddard
Stark
’s arrest and that 
Robb Stark
 has called the Stark banners. Tywin remains unperturbed, declaring that Robb is
only a child. When Tyrion questions how 
Cersei
 has convinced King 
Robert
 to imprison his dear friend Ned, he
learns that the king is dead and 
Joffrey
 now reigns. Tyrion immediately understands that his sister is the true ruler
and knows that things will be very different.
Tyrion is then offered a command in the army: he is to handle 
Marq Piper
 and 
Karyl Vance
, who have been raiding
Jaime’s supply trains across the 
Red Fork
, and 
Beric Dondarrion
, who has been harassing Tywin’s forging parties.
Tyrion is not impressed with this command of perhaps 20 men, so he reveals to his father he has a promise to keep:
weapons and armor for 3,000 clansmen and wagons to carry them.
Then the door opens with a crash as the Captain of the Guard flies across the room. Shagga stamps in, followed by
the other clansmen. Lord Tywin coolly asks who they are and Tyrion explains that they followed him and he wants
to keep them. The clansmen insist that free men have the right to sit on war councils. Once Tyrion has introduced
the clansmen, he introduces his father, complete with all his titles. Lord Tywin claims that even in the 
westerlands
they have heard of the prowess of the mountain clans, and asks what brings them here. The reply is horses, silk, and
steel.
It is then that news arrives that Robb Stark’s host is coming down the 
kingsroad
. Lord Tywin is pleased that he will
be given such an easy chance to defeat House Stark so he can turn his attention towards 
Stannis Baratheon
. He gives
orders that Ser 
Addam Marbrand
 fall back to draw the northerners further south, harassing them along the way.
After ordering the army assembled, Tywin compliments the clansmen’s fearless reputation and promises that if they
fight for him he will provide them with all that Tyrion promised them and more. The clansmen insist that they are
being promised what is already owed. Tywin quickly covers by claiming that his words were a courtesy and that his
boldest knights fear to face the northerners. 
Timett
 takes the bait and declares that the 
Burned Men
 fear nothing.
With the Burned Men agreeing, all the other clans agree, but only if Tyrion accompanies them into battle until the
promises he made them are honored.

Sansa
 attends 
Joffrey
’s first court session as king. After an official call for all the noble houses to pledge their fealty,
the 
small council
 announces a number of new appointments. When he is dismissed from the 
Kingsguard
, Ser
Barristan Selmy
 storms out. In his place, 
the Hound
 is appointed to the Kingsguard. Finally, Sansa comes forward to
ask for leniency for 
her father
, and it is agree that mercy will be granted if he confesses and names Joffrey the true
king.
Synopsis
Sansa
 attends King 
Joffrey
’s first court session. As a reward for being good and promising not to leave the 
Red
Keep
, Sansa has been granted freedom of the castle by Queen 
Cersei
. However, even Sansa realizes that it is an
empty honor since she cannot get past the guards in any case, and has nowhere to go if she did. In addition, the
queen has attached an “honor guard” to accompany Sansa everywhere.
The throne room has been stripped of all the hunting tapestries that King 
Robert
 loved so well. Sansa also notes that
there are no smallfolk and only perhaps twenty of the hundred lords accustomed to wait on King Robert. Sansa
wonders where the others have all gone. As she passes among them, many of the men pretend not to know her and
none will meet her eyes.
Joffrey and Cersei are announced by a herald and enter escorted by members of the 
Kingsguard
. Once he is seated
on the 
Iron Throne
, Joffrey declares that it is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and reward the faithful and asks
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 to read his royal decrees. The list of those that must present themselves to swear fealty goes
on for a long time. Finally, near the end, the names of Sansa’s own 
family
 are called, even down to 
Arya
 and
Rickon
. The naming of Arya suggests to Sansa that her sister must have escaped and be safe in 
Winterfell
.
It is then announced that the king’s grandfather, Lord 
Tywin Lannister
 is to take up the office of 
Hand of the King
 in
place of the traitor 
Eddard Stark
. It is also decreed that Cersei Lannister, as Queen Regent, be seated on the 
small
council
 in place of 
Stannis Baratheon
 and that 
Janos Slynt
, Commander of the 
City Watch of King's Landing
, be
raised to the rank of Lord and granted the ancient seat of 
Harrenhal
 as well as a seat on the small council. Janos
Slynt then enters the hall, displaying his new 
lordly sigil
, to take his seat at the council table. The elevation of Slynt,
a butcher’s son, to the lordship of Harrenhal visibly angers many of the knights and lords present. Finally, Pycelle
reads a decree that, in these times of turmoil, the council considers the safety of King Joffrey to be of paramount
importance.
Queen Cersei stands and calls forth Ser 
Barristan Selmy
. She proceeds to thank the old knight for his many years of
service in the Kingsguard, but declares that the time has come for him to set aside his burden. Ser Barristan is
confused until the new-made Lord Slynt explains bluntly that he is being relieved as 
Lord Commander of the
Kingsguard
. Ser Barristan is plainly stunned and protests that only death may relieve a Kingsguard of his sacred
trust. Cersei asks whose death: his or his king’s. Joffrey goes even further, accusing Ser Barristan of letting his
father die and declaring him too old to protect anyone.
Ser Barristan reminds them that he has long ago forsaken his 
ancestral lands
 and 
keep
 and a wife-to-be in order to
serve in the Kingsguard. He goes on to recount his history as a member of the Kingsguard, protecting and serving

three kings. 
Littlefinger
 notes that all three of these kings are dead. Then Cersei reiterates that Ser Barristan’s time is
done because Joffrey needs young and strong men around him, and that Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 will succeed him as
Lord Commander. Ser Barristan is outraged that a man who killed the king he swore to protect should be made the
Lord Commander.
Varys
 attempts to calm the situation, insisting that they are not ungrateful to Ser Barristan and that Lord Tywin
Lannister has agreed to grant Ser Barristan a tract of land in the 
Westerlands
 with men and gold sufficient to build a
stout keep and servants to see to his every need. Ser Barristan venomously describes such a gift as a hall to die in
and men to bury him. He removes his white cloak and armor and drops them on the floor, declaring that he will die a
knight. Littlefinger quips “A naked knight, it would seem,” which raises laughs from the entire hall, even the
remaining members of the Kingsguard.
The laughter ends abruptly when Ser Barristan draws his sword, but the old knight insists they should have no fear,
even though he could still cut down the remaining five Kingsguard with ease. He adds in disgust that any man who
would serve under the Kingslayer does not deserve the white cloak. Then he throws his sword at the foot of the Iron
Throne, declaring to Joffrey, “Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others.” Before he leaves, the old knight
suggests that perhaps 
Stannis
 will depose Joffrey and sit upon the throne. The knight’s footsteps echo through the
hall as he takes the long way out.
Joffrey is incensed at Ser Barristan’s talk of Stannis and at being called a boy. He orders Ser Barristan seized and
questioned. Finally, Janos Slynt announces that his gold cloaks will see to it. It is then announced that 
Sandor
Clegane
 will fill the vacancy created by the departure of Ser Barristan. Joffrey asks the Hound what he thinks, and
Clegane declares that he has no lands or wife to forsake, but that he will not take a knight’s vows. Ser 
Boros Blount
of the Kingsguard protests that the members of the Kingsguard have always been anointed knights, but is quickly
rebuffed.
The time has finally come for Sansa when she hears the herald ask for any further business. She nervously comes
forward, thinking that she must be as strong as her 
lady mother
. She calls out and Joffrey, seeing her, tells her to
come forward, which emboldens her. She begs mercy for her father. Queen Cersei expresses displeasure, but Varys
only claims that she is a child who does not understand what she says. Joffrey tells the others to let her speak.
The small council questions her about her father’s treason, and Sansa knows better than to deny it. Instead she tells
them that others must have lied to her father, and that he only claimed Joffrey was not the king because of the pain
from his broken leg and the effects of the 
milk of the poppy
. Joffrey calls for his mother, who states that if Lord
Eddard confesses his crime, then they will know he has repented. Sansa prays that her Joffrey be as kind and noble
as she believes he is. Joffrey agrees that if Eddard admits his guilt and swears fealty he will be granted mercy. Sansa
assures them that he will.

Catelyn IX
Ned
 is visited in the 
black cells
 by 
Varys
, who brings him news. He urges Ned to admit to treason, command 
Robb
to lay down his sword, and denounce 
Stannis
 and 
Renly
. When Eddard states that his life is not worth forsaking his
honor, Varys tells him that Cersei has 
Sansa
, whose life is also at stake.
Synopsis
Ned
’s cell contains nothing but straw that stinks of urine. There are no windows, so the darkness is absolute. Ned
thinks back to 
Robert
’s words, “The king eats and the 
Hand
 takes the shit,” and thinks, “The king dies, and the Hand
is buried.” The cell is deeper under the 
Red Keep
 than Ned dares imagine. He remembers the story of 
Maegor the
Cruel
 murdering the masons to keep the castle’s secrets. He also remembers 
Cersei
’s words, “When you play the
game of thrones, you win or you die,” and he knows that he has played and lost. He wants to weep, but he is still a
Stark
 of 
Winterfell
 and his grief and rage freeze inside him.
As his injured leg throbs, Ned damns them all, but can only blame himself; he was a fool. To keep himself sane, he
thinks and plans aloud. 
Stannis
 and 
Renly
 
Baratheon
 are likely gathering armies at 
Dragonstone
 and 
Storm's End
.
Catelyn
 will raise 
the North
 and the armies of 
River
 and 
Vale
 will join her.
As time drags on, Ned finds himself thinking more and more of Robert Baratheon as he was in the flower of his
youth. In the darkness of his cell he can hear Robert ask him, “Gods, how are we come to this? You here, and me
killed by a pig.” Ned broods on how he failed Robert by hiding the truth and letting them kill him. When Ned is half
asleep, a jailer arrives with water, which he drinks eagerly. He asks the jailer for news but is ignored.
As his solitude grows, Ned vividly remembers when he was eighteen at the 
Tourney at Harrenhal
. He remembers
Brandon
’s laughter, Robert’s valor in the melee, 
Jaime Lannister
 joining the 
Kingsguard
, and 
Rhaegar Targaryen
defeating Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 in the final joust. Then Ned remembers the moment when all the smiles died, as
Rhaegar rode past 
his own wife
 to lay the queen of beauty’s laurel in 
Lyanna
’s lap. It was a crown of winter roses,
which Lyanna loved the scent of. In his delirium, Eddard grasps the laurel, but there are thorns underneath and blood
trickles down his fingers. Then he remembers his promise to Lyanna again, and weeps that he is going mad.
The jailer continues to come with a jug of water each day, but no food, and eventually Ned no longer asks questions.
He is sure that Cersei will not kill him as long as Catelyn holds 
the Imp
.
A new jailer arrives with wine instead of water. The voice that tells him to drink is familiar; it is 
Varys
 in a very
effective 
disguise
. Varys tells him that 
Arya
 escaped (which is for the best since Joffrey has no love for her), and
that 
Sansa
 is still betrothed to Joffrey and kept close by the queen. Sansa 
pleaded
 for his life in court a few days
previous. Ned reminds Varys that Cersei will not kill him because Catelyn holds her brother. Varys replies that
Tyrion is the wrong brother. Besides, Catelyn has let Tyrion escape and he is probably now dead in the 
Mountains
of the Moon
.
Ned accuses Varys of standing by while his guards were slaughtered; Varys makes no apologies since he was
unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister soldiers. Varys continues by telling Ned that he plays his part: a
courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight. Ned asks if Varys will free him, but Varys points out
that he would be the prime suspect. When asked if he will deliver a message, Varys admits that he will read it and
then decide if it serves his purpose first. When asked his purpose, Varys states that it is peace.

Varys tells Ned that he struggled to keep Robert alive and protected him from his enemies for fifteen years, but
could not protect him from his friends. Then Varys asks what madness led Ned to tell the queen he knew the truth of
Joffrey’s birth. Ned says it was the madness of mercy; he had hoped to save the children’s lives. Varys remarks that
he often forgets that Ned is one of the few honest men in the world, but when he sees the reward Ned has earned he
understands why.
Ned then asks if Varys questioned 
Lancel Lannister
 about the wine. Varys explains that Cersei gave Lancel the
wineskins and told him it was the king’s favorite vintage. In any case, if it had not been the boar, it would have been
some other form of accident because Cersei needed to be rid of Robert to deal with his brothers: Stannis the iron
gauntlet and Renly the silk glove. Varys then points out that Ned should have taken 
Littlefinger’s
 advice and
supported Joffrey. Ned is shocked that Varys knows about the offer.
Varys then informs Ned that the queen will visit him the next day. She is frightened of him, but fears other enemies
more: 
Jaime Lannister
 fights the 
river lords
, 
Lysa Arryn
 is no friend, 
the Martells
 lust for vengeance for the
murdered 
Elia
 and her babes, and 
Robb Stark
 marches down 
the Neck
. Robb may only be a boy, but he is a boy with
an army. Then there is Stannis who has a true claim to the throne, is a skilled military tactician, and is utterly
without mercy. Most of all, Cersei fears that while 
her father
 battles the Starks and their allies, Stannis will descend
on King's Landing, kill her and her children, and proclaim himself king.
However, Varys explains, Cersei knows “a tame wolf is more use than a dead one,” but telling her Stannis is the true
heir will only lose Ned his head. Ned asks if he is expected to serve the woman who killed his king and crippled his
son. Varys replies that he expects Ned to serve the realm: admit his treason, command Robb to lay down his sword,
denounce Stannis and Renly, and carry Cersei’s secret to the grave. Cersei knows Ned is a man of honor and will let
him join his 
brother
 and his 
bastard son
 in the 
Night's Watch
. The thought of Jon brings shame and deep sorrow to
Ned.
Ned accuses Varys of being Littlefinger’s man, but Varys denies it, saying Littlefinger is the second most devious
man in the kingdom. Varys only feeds him choice whispers so that Littlefinger thinks he is his, just like the queen.
Ned agrees that sounds just like Varys and asks whom the eunuch truly serves. Varys replies that he serves the
realm, and the realm needs peace.
When Varys asks what his answer will be, Ned says his life is not as precious as his honor. Varys points out that
neither he nor the queen has forgotten about Sansa. Caught off-guard by this, Ned begs Varys to leave Sansa out of
his schemes, insisting his daughter is just a child. Varys notes that 
Rhaenys Targaryen
 was also a child when the
Lannisters broke down her door. As he leaves he tells Ned that the next visitor can bring him either food and 
milk of
the poppy
 or Sansa’s head. The choice, Varys says, is up to Ned.

Catelyn X
Robb
’s host arrives at 
the Twins
, where 
Catelyn
 negotiates their crossing of the 
Green Fork
 with Lord 
Walder Frey
.
Synopsis
Catelyn’s
 apprehensions grow as 
Robb
’s host moves south towards 
the Twins
. She fears for 
her father
, 
her brother
,
her husband
, her daughters, and her sons in 
Winterfell
. However, there is nothing she can do for any of them, so she
must save her strength for Robb and for that she must be as fierce and hard as the north.
As she watches her son’s actions, Catelyn realizes that he has learned so much from Ned, but worries about what he
has not learned. Ser 
Brynden
 leads a hundred outriders to scout and screen their movements. His reports state that
Lord 
Walder Frey
 has gathered 4,000 men at 
the Twins
 and that Lord 
Tywin’s
 host is days to the south. Lord Frey
should have gone south to join the host at 
Riverrun
. When Catelyn rides forward, Robb is telling his companion of
the day that Lord Frey must be waiting to join his power to theirs. Catelyn reminds her son that if he expects nothing
from Lord Frey he will never be surprised and that Lord Frey was always too friendly with the 
Lannisters
 for a
bannerman to 
House Tully
.
After they make camp, 
Theon Greyjoy
 brings another report from Ser Brynden. A dozen Lannister scouts have been
killed, and the Lannister force under Ser 
Addam Marbrand
 is retreating south, burning as they go. Theon declares
there is no way the Lannisters will know they have split their forces, but Catelyn cautions that Walder Frey may tell
them. She encourages them to place archers to kill any ravens leaving the Twins, but Theon says it has already been
done.
As she wonders what the Freys have been doing, Catelyn is told that there has been some fighting between the Freys
and Marbrand’s men, but most of the Frey strength is at the Twins. This gives hope to Robb that Lord Frey will
honor his vows, but Catelyn points out that it is one thing to protect one’s land and another to engage in open battle.
The only way across the 
Green Fork
 north of the 
Ruby Ford
 is the bridge at the Twins, especially with the river
running high and no wood for rafts. Theon suggests that they can storm the Twin if they must (they have five times
Lord Frey’s numbers), but Catelyn responds that it would not be easy. There is also no time; while they laid siege to
the Twins, Lord Tywin would bring up his host and attack from the rear. Catelyn can see that Robb is unsure as he
asks her what his father would do. Catelyn insists that he would find a way across no matter what it takes.
Ser Brynden arrives with the dire news that Edmure’s host has been 
defeated
 under the walls of Riverrun and
scattered. Edmure himself has been wounded and captured, but some survivors have taken refuge inside Riverrun.
Other news is that Lord Frey has withdrawn his strength inside his twin castles. Robb is frustrated, and states that he
will pull the walls down around Lord Frey. Catelyn rebukes him, saying he sounds like a sulky boy and that
sometimes words are needed. She explains that the Freys have never failed to extract their toll in the 600 years that
they have controlled the crossing. What this toll will be, they have yet to learn but if Robb is unwilling to pay the
toll, the only option Catelyn can see is to retreat to 
Moat Cailin
 to meet Lord Tywin in battle. She rides away, not
wanting to make it seem that she was usurping Robb’s authority and asks herself if her husband has taught their son
wisdom, or how to kneel.

It is near midday when they arrive at the Twins, two ugly stout castles on either side of the Green Fork with a wide
bridge between them. The Freys have gotten rich off the tolls from this bridge. Upon seeing the castles, the northern
lords can see it would be very nearly impossible to take by storm. A dozen knights led by Ser 
Stevron Frey
, heir to
Lord Walder, come forward from the sally port. Ser Stevron asks who leads and Robb rides forward to be told that
Lord Walder invites him to share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain his purpose. None of Robb’s
lords like this, fearing that Robb could easily be captured and sold to the Lannisters. Catelyn can tell that Stevron is
not pleased by the accusations, and attempts to save the negotiations by volunteering to go herself. There are
objections, but she tells them that Lord Walder is her father’s bannerman and will not harm her, hoping it is true. It
is agreed and Stevron’s brother, Ser 
Perwyn Frey
, remains as a hostage to her fair treatment.
The frail 90-year-old Lord Walder Frey meets Catelyn in the great hall with all but one (the hostage, Perwyn) of his
21 sons, 36 grandsons, and countless other descendants. Walder is impolite and direct; even some of his sons point
out his impoliteness, but he does not respond well to their criticism. Catelyn knows that she has to be careful with
her words and explains that she is there to ask him to open his gates so they can proceed to Riverrun where she
would have expected to find him. Lord Walder insists that he was still gathering his strength when her brother lost
the battle. Catelyn doubts Lord Walder’s version of events, but does not press the issue. She asks that they talk
privately, and Lord Walder commands all the others to leave.
Once they are alone, Lord Walder declares that his descendants are all waiting for him to die, then he asks why he
should let Robb’s host cross. When Catelyn makes a very subtle threat about the size of Robb’s army, Lord Walder
retorts that her son’s army will be 20,000 fresh corpses when the Lannisters arrive. When Catelyn reminds Lord
Walder of his vows to 
House Tully
, the old man counters that he also swore allegiance to the king, making her and
her son nothing but rebels. Lord Walder then takes his turn at threatening: if he had the sense the gods gave a fish he
would deny them the crossing and let the Lannisters have them. However, the old man quickly reveals that he does
not care for the Lannisters either, with their gold, their lions, and their arrogant pride. Lord Walder goes on to say
that if the Lannisters want his help they must 
ask
. Catelyn humbly stresses that 
she
 is asking, as are her father, her
brother, her sons, and her husband with her voice.
Walder complains about her father insulting him by not being present for his last few weddings; an insult despite
Lord Hoster’s failing health. The old man complains about Lord Hoster not marrying Edmure to one of his
daughters, then he complains about how his heirs were defeated in a tourney he attended. He also complains that 
Jon
Arryn
 would not foster two of his grandsons, or let him foster 
Robert Arryn
. When Lord Arryn announced that his
son was going to be fostered with Lord 
Stannis
, 
Lysa
 stormed off and all the Jon could do was apologize. Catelyn
asks if it was not Lord Tywin that Robert Arryn was to be fostered with, but Lord Walder insists that he knows the
difference between Stannis and Tywin. Then Lord Walder asks again why he should allow them to cross and the
haggling begins.
Catelyn returns to Robb followed by Ser 
Jared Frey
, Ser 
Hosteen Frey
, Ser 
Danwell Frey
, Walder’s bastard 
Ronel
Rivers
, and a long column of pikemen. She tells Robb that he has been granted the crossing and that all but 400 of
Lord Frey’s forces will join his army. In exchange, two of Lord Walder’s grandsons will be fostered by the Starks at
Winterfell
, 
Olyvar Frey
 will become Robb’s squire, Arya will marry Walder’s youngest son 
Elmar
, and Robb
himself will marry his choice of Lord Walder’s daughters when the fighting is done. Robb, realizing he has no
choice if he wants to cross, consents. Catelyn suggests that he should leave 400 archers and swordsmen at the Twins
to ensure Lord Walder keeps faith under a reliable man. Robb suggests Ser 
Helman Tallhart
 and Catelyn agrees.
Robb and his cavalry cross that evening as Lord Walder Frey watches from a litter while 
Roose Bolton
 and the
infantry stay on the east bank to march south and confront Lord Tywin.

Jon
 is presented with the 
Valyrian steel
 sword 
Longclaw
 by 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
. Jon attempts to refuse, but
the commander insists. Later, Jon gets a message that Maester 
Aemon
 wants to see him. The maester knows that Jon
is divided between his duty and his family loyalties and explains that he sympathizes. When Jon rejects his empathy,
the old man reveals that he is Aemon Targaryen, son of King 
Maekar I
.
Synopsis
Jon
 lies that he is well when asked by 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
. His right hand is swathed in bandages halfway to
the elbow and pains him constantly. When he threw the burning curtains onto the 
wight
 of 
Othor
, Jon burned his
hand more seriously than he realized, but Maester 
Aemon
 has assured him that there will be no permanent damage
aside from the scars. Jon is glad, however, that only 
Ghost
 can see him writhe and weep from the pain at night. Yet,
when he does manage to sleep, Jon has nightmares of battling a wight with 
his father
’s face that are far worse.
Jon notices that the Lord Commander looks old and grumpy without his beard, which has been shaved after it was
badly singed in the fire. Mormont explains to Jon that the rangers’ search has found no sign of 
his uncle
 or more
wights; two of those were bad enough. Still both Mormont and Maester Aemon are sure there will be more because
the cold winds are rising.
Jon states there was a bird last night, saying he hoped for news of his father. Mormont assures Jon that he would
have told him if there was. This message brought word that Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 has been cast out of the 
Kingsguard
and is now wanted for treason, having killed two 
gold cloaks
 sent to arrest him. Mormont’s distaste is plain for men
who would send gold cloaks to arrest a knight as renowned of Ser Barristan the Bold. The Lord Commander goes on
to lament that they have 
white shadows
 in the woods, 
undead
 stalking the halls, and a 
boy
 on the 
Iron Throne
.
Mormont notes that Grand Maester 
Pycelle
 did not include any news about Jon’s sisters; they only tell the Night's
Watch what they want them to know. Jon thinks that 
he
 is only told what Mormont want 
him
 to know; he has heard
nothing of his brother 
Robb Stark
 in the south.
Mormont asks when Maester Aemon believes Jon will be able to resume using his hand. Jon says soon and the Lord
Commander brings out a sword, declaring that Jon is ready for it. Jon is puzzled but is told to take the sword. He
recognizes it as a 
bastard sword
 of 
Valyrian steel
. Mormont explains that the sword is named 
Longclaw
 and has
belonged to 
House Mormont
 for five centuries. After it was burned in the fire in his tower, Mormont has had the
pommel remade into the likeness of a white wolf's head with red garnets for eyes.
When he was young, Jon dreamed of doing great deeds and being granted 
Ice
 in reward for saving his father’s life,
but he knew it was a folly. Now the memory that he might wish to steal his brother’s birthright shames him. Jon
does not feel that he deserves Longclaw either and attempts to decline, but Mormont insists he has earned it with his
quick thinking to use fire to destroy the wight. Jon accepts, but reminds himself that Mormont is not his father and
he still dreams of Ice.
Mormont tells Jon that he will now have to practice his two-handed strokes as well, suggesting that Ser 
Endrew
Tarth
 from the 
Shadow Tower
, who will assume the duties of master-at-arms, can help him. Ser 
Alliser Thorne
 has

been sent to 
King's Landing
 with the hand of 
Jafer Flowers
 to attempt to get the boy king’s attention. Mormont
explains that a message from an anointed high-born knight should get more attention than from an old crow. It also
puts a thousand leagues between Jon and Ser Alliser.
Mormont insists, however, that none of this means that he approves of Jon’s actions: it takes a man to wield
Longclaw and he expects Jon to act the part. Jon agrees, thinking again that it is not the blade he would have chosen,
but a fine one. He is also glad to be free from Ser Alliser. Then Mormont sends Jon to fetch his supper. As he leaves,
Jon sees the guards smiling; one man comments on the sword’s quality and another tells Jon he earned it. Jon is
angry but cannot say why.
Outside, Jon’s friends are waiting for him, wanting to see the sword. Pyp jokes that Jon is probably the only man in
the entire history of the Night’s Watch to be rewarded for burning down the Lord Commander's Tower. Even Jon
has to smile; no one blames him for setting the fire that destroyed the wight, even if it did gut the top two floors of
the tower. The other wight was hacked to pieces, but not before killing Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
 and four other men. The
thought of the wights sours Jon’s mood and he quickly leaves his friends to get the Lord Commander’s supper. Jon
is deeply affected by facing the wight, but does not blame his friends for not understanding. They cannot
understand; they did not see the pale glow of the blue eyes or feel the cold black hands. They also do not know of
the fighting in the 
riverlands
.
Ghost is lying beside the door to his room. Jon thinks back to when he found the 
direwolf
 hidden in the snow. He
shows Ghost the pommel of the swords, stating it is him. Then 
Sam
 arrives. He does not want to see the blade,
stating he has seen his father’s Valyrian steel 
blade
 and it was so sharp he feared he might hurt one of his sisters.
Sam then announces that Maester Aemon wants to see Jon. Jon is puzzled since it is not time for his bandages to be
changed, but then accuses Sam of telling the maester that he knows about the riverlands. Sam insists that he thinks
the maester knew anyway. Jon tells Sam that he will find the maester himself.
Clydas
 is helping Maester Aemon in the rookery when Jon arrives. The maester dismisses Clydas and asks Jon to
assist him with feeding the ravens. As they work, Aemon explains that although other birds can be trained to fly
messages the 
Night's Watch
 has always preferred ravens. The old man goes on to explain that the sworn brothers do
not wed because love is the bane of honor and duty, which the Night’s Watch cannot afford; they must be totally
committed to defending the realm from the darkness to the north.
When Jon fails to understand, the maester explains that in every man’s life there comes a day when he must choose
between his duty and his family, and only one man in ten thousand is strong enough to choose duty. Jon questions if
the maester believes this is his day. Maester Aemon only replies that he knows the choice is always hard. Jon insists
that the old man does not know what it feels like to be in his situation.
Maester Aemon sighs and sadly tells Jon that his vows have been tested three times: once as a boy, once in his
prime, and once as an old man. The old maester elaborates that the last test was just as hard as the others, regardless
that he was blind, frail, and helpless. He recalls how it grieved him to sit forgotten as his ravens brought news from
the south of the ruin of his House and the death of his 
brother’s grandson
, and 
his
 son
, and even the 
little
 
children
.
Jon asks who Maester Aemon is, almost in dread. The old man insists that he is only a maester of the 
Citadel
 bound
to 
Castle Black
 and the Night’s Watch, but that his father was 
Maekar
, the First of His Name, and that his brother
Aegon
 ruled after their father in his stead. Jon is astounded. Aemon declares that he 
does
 know how Jon feels, and
so he will not tell Jon to stay or go. Jon must make his own choice, and live with it for the rest of his days as Aemon
has.

Daenerys VIII
Khal
 
Drogo
 has defeated another 
khalasar
, capturing a town and many captives. 
Daenerys
 intervenes when she sees
Dothraki
 warriors raping the women. When she finds Drogo, Daenerys is concerned about her husband’s wounds
and calls for the healers. 
Mirri Maz Duur
, one of the women she has rescued, speaks up that she is a healer, and
Drogo agrees to let her tend to his wounds in her temple.
Synopsis
Daenerys
 moves through the trampled fields filled with the dead and wounded around the burning town of the Lamb
Men, or 
Lhazareen
. 
Khal
 
Ogo
’s 
khalasar
 was attacking the town when Khal 
Drogo
 arrived. Daenerys remembers
that Khal Ogo was among those who shared the high bench at the 
feast
 when 
Viserys
 was crowned. However, this is
not 
Vaes Dothrak
. Daenerys suspects some of the villagers probably mistook them for deliverance, but once Khal
Ogo was defeated Drogo’s 
khalasar
 plundered the town just as badly.
Now the captives from both the village and Ogo’s 
khalasar
 are being collected for slaves. To an outsider the
Lhazareen look similar to the Dothraki, but now Daenerys can plainly see the differences. In addition, the Dothraki
captives do not seem to fear slavery, while the villagers stumble about in fear and sorrow.
Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 meets Daenerys at the entrance to the village. The knight brings news that Drogo has killed Khal
Ogo and 
his son
, taking only minor wounds. He also informs her that most of the rival 
khalasar
 has fled, but there
could still be as many as 10,000 captives. Ser Jorah says he has suggested they drive the slaves south to 
Meereen
where they will fetch a better price; more than enough gold to hire the ships they need to reach the 
Seven Kingdoms
.
As she watches the carnage around her, Daenerys can only think about the price of the 
Iron Throne
.
The scenes of rape disturb Daenerys the most. She orders Ser Jorah and her 
bodyguards
 
Jhogo
 and 
Quaro
 to stop the
rape of a 
wailing girl
. Ser Jorah tries to explain that this is not wise since she is depriving the riders of their reward
for shedding blood for their 
khal
. Jhogo and Quaro point out that the Dothraki believe the girl should feel honored
and even Daenerys’ handmaid 
Irri
 agrees. Daenerys is not dissuaded and commands Ser Jorah and the others to stop
the rape. Ser Jorah declares that she truly is 
Rhaegar Targaryen
’s sister and obeys.
Stopping the rape requires the death of two of the rapers. When asked what to do with the raped girl, Daenerys
commands 
Doreah
 to tend to her hurts, mainly because the blonde-haired 
Lysene
 girl does not look Dothraki.
Daenerys then rides on into the settlement and begins to rescue all of the other rape victims she sees. Ser Jorah tries
to explain that she cannot save them all, but Daenerys refuses to believe him.
Daenerys finds Drogo with an arrow through his arm and an 
arakh
 cut that has taken off one of his nipples. Drogo
insists that they are only scratches and boasts that he personally slew not only Khal Ogo, but also his son 
Fogo
, who
was 
khal
 after Ogo. Daenerys praises her husband.
Then a warrior named 
Mago
, who rides with the 
khas
 of 
Ko
 
Jhaqo
, rides up with angry words about Daenerys’
actions. After listening to both sides, Drogo explains to Daenerys that rape is part of the Dothraki way of war.
Daenerys insists that the Lhazareen women should be made wives and given a place in the 
khalasar
. A 
bloodrider
named 
Qotho
 asks haughtily if a horse breeds with sheep, but Daenerys replies that a dragon feeds on both horse and

sheep. Drogo laughs at this and proclaims that his son inside her has made Daenerys fierce. The 
khal
 goes on to tell
Mago to find another lamb to mount, as these belong to the 
khaleesi
.
When Drogo reaches out to Daenerys, he winces and Daenerys cries for the healers. She is told that Drogo sent the
healers away to tend the more grievously wounded. 
Mirri Maz Duur
, a Lhazareen woman Daenerys rescued, speaks
up, saying she can help. 
Aggo
 is about to cut her throat when Daenerys demands that the woman, who wears the
remains of fine clothing, be allowed to speak. Mirri Maz Duur explains that she is a healer and 
godswife
. Drogo’s
bloodriders
 mistrust her, naming her a healer of sheep and a 
maegi
.
Daenerys asks Mirri Maz Duur how she learned to become a healer, and the godswife states that she has learned
from many including a 
maester
 named 
Marwyn
. Talk of a maester immediately interests Ser Jorah, and he asks for
details. Ser Jorah then tells Daenerys that maesters know much of healing. Mirri Maz Duur explains that the 
Great
Shepherd
 sent her to earth to heal all his lambs. Drogo finally speaks up and permits the godswife to heal him. Mirri
Maz Duur suggests that the healing magic will be stronger inside her temple. Drogo rises to walk and falters, but he
refuses 
Haggo
’s offer to help. Seeing that her husband is weak, Daenerys moves up to help him, telling him that
since she is not a man she can help him.
Mirri Maz Duur brings Drogo into the remains of her temple and says it is best if the rest leave, but Daenerys and
the bloodriders refuse. Daenerys assures everyone that Mirri Maz Duur will do no harm, feeling she can trust a
woman she saved from rape. The godswife says if they insist on remaining they can help hold Drogo down. She
pulls out the arrow, pours boiling wine on the wound, then sews the skin back in place. Next, she applies a plaster of
leaves to the chest wound and instructs Drogo not to drink wine or 
milk of the poppy
 or to remove the poultice for
ten days. When told he will have a great scar, Drogo declares, “I sing of my scars.”
Daenerys asks the godswife about an earlier comment about birthing songs and learns she is also a midwife.
Therefore, she asks Mirri Maz Duur to attend her when she gives birth. Drogo tells her, “You do not ask a slave, you
tell her.” Then Drogo commands that the 
khalasar
 must ride and leaves. Qotho lingers long enough to remind the
godswife, “As the 
khal
 fares, so shall you.”

Tyrion IX
Tyrion
 and his 
clansmen
 are assigned to the vanguard under the command of Ser 
Gregor Clegane
. Returning to his
tent, Tyrion is greeted by a whore named 
Shae
, whom 
Bronn
 has found for him. Before dawn, Tyrion is roused by
the call to arms. In the ensuing 
battle on the Green Fork
, Tyrion and his clansmen do well and the enemy is routed.
Afterward Lord 
Tywin Lannister
 learns that Robb Stark has tricked him.
Synopsis
A long table draped with a golden cloth has been set up on a hill overlooking the 
kingsroad
 for Lord 
Tywin
Lannister
 and his chief knights and lords bannermen to take their evening meal. 
Tyrion
, arriving late, is embarrassed
as he waddles up to the table. Lord Tywin mocks that he will charge Tyrion with burying the dead if he arrives as
late to battle as he does to table. Tyrion replies sourly that surely a peasant or two could be found for him to kill.
The news from Ser 
Addam Marbrand
 is that 
Robb Stark
 has moved south from the 
Twins
 with 
House Frey
’s levies
in tow and is now no more than a day away. Tyrion mockingly protests that he is about to eat and Tywin asks if the
thought of coming to grips with Robb unmans him. Tyrion jests that he would prefer to come to grips with the roast
pig, which is far more tender and better smelling than Robb.
The army’s quartermaster, Lord 
Leo Lefford
, who has had to supply Tyrion’s 300 
clansmen
, uses this opportunity to
quip that he hopes the clansmen are braver than Tyrion or else they have wasted good steel. Tyrion assures him that
the arms and armor will be put to good use. Ser 
Kevan
, who Tyrion knows is giving voice to Lord Tywin’s thoughts,
takes the opportunity to inform Tyrion that he and his clansmen will fight in the vanguard since they seem so
ferocious. Tyrion stresses the ferocity of the clansmen by recounting their recent lethal fight over a sausage.
Lord Tywin uses this as evidence of a poor commander who cannot maintain discipline. Tyrion knows that 
his
brother
 could always make men follow him eagerly, but Tyrion lacks such charisma and must use gold and his
family name to get men to follow him. Tywin then tells Kevan that because the clansmen have no discipline, maybe
they should not be in the vanguard. When Lord Tywin suggests that he should guard the baggage instead, Tyrion
angrily agrees to command the vanguard, only to learn that he will not command, but be under Ser 
Gregor Clegane
.
Disgusted, Tyrion excuses himself after only eating one bite of the delicious pork.
Tyrion gets lost in the camp but finds his way by following the sounds of 
Shagga
’s laughter in the dark. 
Conn
 calls
for him to share their meat and Tyrion agrees to join them when it is cooked, doubting that will be before the battle.
When he reaches his tent, he finds Bronn sharing wine with his new servants—a groom, a body servant, a squire
named 
Podrick Payne
, and a slim young dark-haired whore named 
Shae
. Tyrion told Bronn to find him a young one
with a pretty face and to be sure to tell her who and what he is, so as to avoid the displeasing look of revulsion that
sometimes greets him. He likes the girl Bronn has found.
Tyrion invites Shae into his tent. When he asks if she is a maiden, Shae tells him that finding out will cost him
double and Tyrion decides they will get along fine. Tyrion explains that her duties besides sleeping with him include
serving him and monogamy. When they have sex, Shae expresses pleasure, which pleases Tyrion, who decides he
does not care if it is feigned. Tyrion also finds it good to be with a woman after nearly a year of enforced abstinence.

Afterward, he sneaks out of the tent without waking Shae. Outside, he asks Bronn where he found her and is told
that she was stolen from a knight because all the pretty ones were taken. Tyrion comments that he did not ask Bronn
to make him an enemy, but agrees to keep Shae. When Tyrion asks for the name of the knight so he can avoid him
in battle, Bronn insists that Tyrion will have him for protection. Tyrion then tells Bronn that if they both survive the
battle, he can name his reward. Bronn asks who would want to kill Tyrion and Tyrion explains who has put them in
the vanguard. Bronn only laughs and jests that a small man with a big shield will give the enemy archers fits.
Tyrion returns to the tent to find Shae. When Tyrion asks whom Bronn has taken her from, she tells him that the
knight was a minor figure and a small man. Tyrion mockingly asks if she takes him for a giant, but Shae insists she
does, calling him ‘’my giant of Lannister.’’
Tyrion wakes before dawn to battle horns and Shae’s cries. Outside, Bronn informs him that the 
Stark
 host has come
down the kingsroad at night and they are forming up for battle a mile north. Tyrion’s well-fitting suit of armor is at
Casterly Rock
, so Podrick Payne and Shae help him into the ill-fitting oddments that have replaced it. Tyrion asks
Shae to weep for him if he dies, but she only asks how he will know. He is helped onto his heavily-armored horse
and given his battle-axe. Shae tells him he looks fearsome, but Tyrion disagrees. He instructs his squire Podrick to
take her safely home if they lose. As the sun rises and he rides north, the clansmen fall in behind him.
On the 
battlefield
, Lord Tywin commands the reserve in his magnificent armor that puts Jaime’s to shame. Ser
Kevan commands the center and Ser Addam Marbrand the right, where Lord Tywin has massed his armored
knights. The northmen will be tired after their long sleepless march; Tyrion wonders what Robb Stark was thinking.
Tyrion spies the massive Ser Gregor Clegane with the vanguard massing on the left. Bronn, looking at Ser Gregor,
states that it is best to follow a big man into battle since he attracts all the archers, which Tyrion finds amusing. They
hear Ser Gregor tell his men that if anyone runs he will cut them down himself. Tyrion receives his orders to hold
the left of the left next to the river. When Tyrion’s clansmen reach the 
Green Fork
, Tyrion commands them to keep
themselves between the enemy and the river. Then the clansmen raise their battle cry of “Halfman!”
Although the van is all mounted, it is comprised of misfits and sweepings, including half-trained boys. Tyrion notes
that the force is unfit to hold the left, and wonders what his father was thinking. When the enemy appears, their
numbers seem great, but Tyrion knows that his father has more. He also notes that the Freys are among the enemy.
The northerners charge and are answered first by the Lannister bowmen. Ser Gregor orders the charge, and the
clansmen quickly leave Tyrion in their dust. The charge nearly breaks against the 
Karstark
 spearmen opposing them,
but Ser Gregor’s horse crashes through the shield wall as it dies. The monstrous knight rises from his fallen mount
and begins slaying men all around. Before the gap in the enemy line can close, Shagga rides through right behind
Ser Gregor, followed by the other clansmen.
The northmen’s line begins to crumble under the assault. Then Tyrion and Bronn are in the fight and Tyrion
successfully defeats a number of enemies, including a close fight with a tall northerner whom Tyrion only
overcomes because his horse bites the man’s cheek, giving Tyrion the opening to kill him. Then a knight with a
morning star comes at Tyrion, wounding and unhorsing him. The knight calls for Tyrion to yield, but Tyion uses the
spike on his helmet to eviscerate the horse, which falls on the knight, disabling and trapping him. The knight yields
to Tyrion. Tyrion can now see that the battle has moved past him. The northerners are being pushed against the hills
and pelted by arrows. Finally, Bronn rides up and Tyrion sees his father ride by with the reserves to break the
northerners. Tyrion finds the remnants of his clansmen, of whom perhaps half, including 
Conn
 and 
Ulf son of Umar
,
are dead.
Tyrion searches for his father and finds him sipping wine as his armor is removed. Lord Tywin tells him that his
clansmen fought well. Tyrion asks if that surprised him and if they were supposed to be butchered. Lord Tywin
admits that he expected the left to collapse, hoping that Robb Stark would press into the breach where they might
capture him. Tyrion demands to know why he was not informed. His father declares that a feigned rout is always
less convincing and that he is not in the habit of trusting men who consort with 
savages
 and 
sellswords
. Lord Tywin
continues that the Stark boy proved more cautious than expected, but it is a victory. Then Tywin notes that Tyrion is
wounded and Tyrion asks that he call for his 
maesters
.
At that moment, Ser Addam Marbrand rides up with the news that Lord 
Cerwyn
, Ser 
Wylis Manderly
, 
Harrion

Karstark
, and four 
Freys
 were captured and Lord 
Halys Hornwood
 killed. The bad news follows: Lord 
Roose Bolton
has escaped, and Robb has crossed with most of his horse at the Twins and is riding hard for 
Riverrun
. Tyrion
remembers his father’s words that the Stark boy would be more brave than wise and thinks that he would laugh if it
didn't hurt so much.

Robb Stark
 has managed to lead his host to 
Riverrun
 without detection. Now 
Catelyn
 waits with her guards as her
son leads his host to 
ambush
 Ser 
Jaime Lannister
. Once the battle is over, Robb returns with Jaime as a captive.
However, the death of several of Robb's party mars the sweetness of the victory.
Synopsis
Catelyn
 is protected by thirty men under the command of 
Hallis Mollen
, 
Winterfell
's captain of the 
guard
, as 
Robb
’s
host waits to descend upon Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 in the 
Whispering Wood
. Robb had wanted to leave her fifty guards
and Catelyn had only wanted ten, so neither of them left happy.
Robb’s army rode hard from the 
Twins
 to catch Jaime by surprise. Along the way, they were joined by the
Mallisters
 and some of the forces scattered after 
Edmure’s
 
defeat
, but Ser Jaime Lannister still outnumbers them
three to one. However, in order to besiege 
Riverrun
 the 
Lannisters
 were forced to separate their twelve thousand foot
and two or three thousand horse into three camps separated by rivers, which leaves them vulnerable. In addition,
Catelyn’s uncle, Ser 
Brynden
, led a screening force of three hundred picked men to kill the few outriders that Jaime
bothered to post, allowing their advance to remain secret.
Before they face the siege, however, Robb and his men have concocted an elaborate trap. Unable to endure the
boredom of a siege, Jaime has personally ridden out three times to chase raiders. To exploit this, Robb sent a few
hundred men with 
Tully
 banners to lure Jaime and his men into an ambush in the narrow valley of the Whispering
Wood.
As she waits, Catelyn realizes that she is again waiting for a man who has promised to return from war, as she has
done all her life. First, she waited for 
her father
 when she was young. Then it was for 
Brandon Stark
, who never
came back. Then she waited for 
Ned Stark
, who left a fortnight after he married her to fight in 
Robert's Rebellion
. At
least Ned left her pregnant with Robb, whom she must wait for now.
Robb shows no fear as the battle approaches, but Catelyn still fears for the life of her son, remembering him as a
babe at her breast. As Robb’s squire 
Olyvar Frey
 helps with his shield and helm, Catelyn sees a tall young knight
appear where her son had stood. Robb leaves her to let his men see him before the battle, as his father had once
recommended, with his 
direwolf
 
Grey Wind
 shadowing him.
While she waits, Catelyn hears 
snow shrikes
, which remind her of Winterfell. Suddenly, horns blow and arrows fly
as the trap closes. Catelyn can initially see the moonlight on the lances, but soon she can only hear the sounds of the
battle in the Whispering Wood
. Eventually the sounds fade, and then Robb returns on a different horse with the
blood of one of his bodyguards on his arm. They drag Jaime before Catelyn, and the captive declares that he would
offer up his sword, but he seems to have mislaid it. Catelyn asks Jaime to return her husband and daughters, but he
replies that he seems to have mislaid them as well.
Theon Greyjoy
 calls for Jaime's head but Robb considers the Kingslayer more valuable alive and, like his father
Ned, refuses to condone the murder of prisoners. Robb orders Jaime taken away with a strong guard in part to
protect him from Lord 
Rickard Karstark
, who will want vengeance for his sons 
Torrhen
 and 
Eddard
 along with

Daryn Hornwood
. Catelyn then learns that when Jaime saw he was lost, he charged Robb’s party, hoping to cut
down Robb. Robb states that he would be dead if not for Lord Karstark’s sons and the others.
Despite these losses, the battle is a resounding victory for Robb. They have taken close to a hundred knights and a
dozen lords bannermen captive. Catelyn points out that they have only won one battle, not the war. Although they
took the leader, most of the Lannister host is still besieging Riverrun, and they still have to deal with Lord 
Tywin
Lannister
. Robb agrees that Catelyn is right, and declares that they still have the siege of Riverrun to defeat.

Khal
 
Drogo
 falls off his horse. 
Daenerys
 orders the 
khalasar
 to halt and calls for 
Mirri Maz Duur
. The godswife
declares that only blood magic can save Drogo. As the rite is being performed, Drogo’s 
bloodriders
 attempt to
intervene. A fight ensues in which Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 is injured and all of Drogo’s bloodriders are killed. Daenerys
starts to hemorrhage and Ser Jorah carries her into Drogo's tent.
Synopsis
Khal
 
Drogo
 is looking drawn and swaying in his saddle. He makes no reaction as the large 
bloodflies
 circle and bite
him. This concerns 
Daenerys
 who is used to seeing her husband catch the hated insects with his hands, quick as a
snake, when they come too near. Drogo tore off the poultice 
Mirri Maz Duur
 had prepared for him six days ago,
complaining that it itched. Instead, he used the soothing mud plaster of the herb women. He has also been drinking
poppy wine, fermented mare’s milk, and pepper beer heavily but not eating much. At night, he thrashes violently
and even the kicking of their unborn child not longer seems to interest him.
As Daenerys reaches for him, Drogo reels from the saddle and falls heavily to the ground. Daenerys rushes to him.
Only half conscious and struggling in her arms, Drogo insists that he must ride, for the 
khal
 who cannot ride is no
khal
. Now Drogo has fallen from his horse and it has been seen. When Drogo’s 
bloodriders
 come up, Daenerys
commands that they will halt for the day and that the slaves be called to erect Drogo’s tent. The bloodriders are not
happy with either command; the region is not a camping ground and a woman cannot command. Daenerys insists
that Drogo will punish them if they do not obey her and commands 
Qotho
 to find Mirri Maz Duur.
Once the tent is erected, Daenerys and her handmaidens bring the feverish Drogo inside and bathe him. Finally, Ser
Jorah Mormont
 arrives with word that Drogo’s fall is known all over the camp. He asks Daenerys to send her maids
away and breaks the plaster from Drogo’s wound. The wound has festered and is rank with corruption. Ser Jorah
declares that Drogo is beyond saving and that they must flee before he dies.
Daenerys asks why she should run, since her son will be 
khal
 after Drogo. Ser Jorah explains that the 
Dothraki
follow only the strong; the 
khalasar
 will not follow a baby. Instead, the 
ko
s will fight for the leadership and her baby
will be killed as a challenge to their authority. Daenerys insists that her 
khas
 and Drogo’s bloodriders will keep her
child safe, but Jorah reminds her that the bloodriders' last duty is only to return her to the 
dosh khaleen
 in 
Vaes
Dothrak
 and then follow their 
khal
. Daenerys does not want to return to join the 
dosh khaleen
, but she also refuses to
leave Drogo.
Mirri Maz Duur arrives with Qotho, looking exhausted. Both Qotho and 
Haggo
, taking one look at Drogo, blame the
godwife and start beating her. When Daenerys demands that they stop, Qotho threatens to take Daenerys out to be
raped along with the 
maegi
. Ser Jorah intervenes and eventually the bloodriders leave.
After they leave, Ser Jorah explains that the bloodriders die with their 
khal
 and are now beyond fear because they
see their death approaching. Daenerys tells Ser Jorah to don his armor. Once the knight has left, Daenerys tells Mirri
Maz Duur to heal Drogo. The godswife states that he is beyond help and will be gone by morning. Daenerys pleads
with her, insisting that there must be a way, a magical way. Mirri Maz Duur admits she does know some dark magic
learned at great cost from a bloodmage from the 
Shadow Lands
; it will cost a life. Daenerys asks if it means her life,

but Mirri Maz Duur assures her it does not.
They lower Drogo into a bath and bring his stallion into the tent. 
Jhogo
 pleads with Daenerys not to use forbidden
bloodmagic and to allow him to kill the 
maegi
. It takes 
Rakharo
, 
Quaro
, and 
Aggo
 to force the frightened stallion to
the tub while Mirri Maz Duur chants. The godswife uses a red bronze knife covered in glyphs to cut the horse’s
throat and fill the tub with blood. The godswife then orders Daenerys, who is now filled with fear, to leave the tent;
no one must look upon the old and dark powers the godswife’s spell will wake. Outside, the gathered crowd stares at
her. When Ser Jorah, now in his armor, sees the bloody footprints Daenerys leaves he asks what foolish thing she
has done.
Daenerys can hear the 
maegi’s
 voice and see the shadows moving inside the tent. The Dothraki start to mutter and
draw back. Drogo’s bloodriders return with the healing eunuchs. When Qotho sees what is happening he moves
toward the tent, intending to kill Mirri Maz Duur and then Daenerys. He pushes Daenerys aside as she tries to
interfere and she screams for her 
khas
 to stop him. Quaro is quickly cut down, but Ser Jorah steps forward to
confront Qotho. Without his helmet, the knight is hard pressed by Qotho’s rapid strikes. Then Qotho’s 
arakh
 cuts
into Ser Jorah’s hip and catches on the bone, giving Ser Jorah the opportunity to kill him.
Meanwhile, the other bloodriders and members of Daenerys’ 
khas
 have also come to battle. Jhogo’s whip catches
Haggo
 around the neck, giving Rakharo the chance to kill him. Daenerys is hemorrhaging from the birth of her child
and crawling toward the tent, screaming that the price is too high. The bloodrider 
Cohollo
 catches her and is about to
kill her when 
Aggo
’s arrow takes him in the chest.
When Daenerys raises her head again, the crowd is dispersing. Some are saddling horses and riding off as the sun
sets. She cannot rise and the shadows are whirling inside the tent. Ser Jorah comes to assist her and calls for her
handmaids to get the birthing women. 
Doreah
 informs him that they believe Daenerys is cursed and are gone. Then
she hears someone (possibly Aggo) telling them to take her to the 
maegi
. Daenerys knows she does not want to go
into the tent, but cannot speak. 
Irri
 and Doreah both agree that they heard Mirri Maz Duur say she knows about
birthing.
Ser Jorah carries Daenerys into the tent.

Arya I
Arya
 is surviving on the streets of 
King's Landing
 by hunting pigeons. When she hears the summoning bells, she
joins the crowd to watch 
her father
 confess his treason. Once the confession is done, King 
Joffrey
 demands his head.
Arya attempts to get to him, but 
Yoren
 of the 
Night's Watch
 stops her. Afterward, he declares that she is coming
with him.
Synopsis
Arya
 is catching pigeons on the Street of Flour. Compared with catching cats, pigeons are easy. She uses her
wooden practice sword to knock one from the air and snaps its neck.
After taking the pigeon, Arya walks by a cart filled with tarts. When she asks for one, she is charged three coppers
she doesn’t have. The man also declines to trade for her pigeon. Arya uses the seeing taught by 
Syrio Forel
 and
decides she could steal one and get away, but the seller guesses her intention and points out the two 
gold cloaks
close by. Even though they are paying her no attention, the sight of the gold cloaks ties Arya's stomach in knots and
she lets the man pass.
At the 
Red Keep
, which she avoids, Arya can see the heads rotting on spikes. There are all sorts of stories among the
smallfolk: Lord 
Renly
 killed King 
Robert
 and fled, or the king died hunting a boar, or the king died 
eating
 a boar, or
the king was poisoned by 
Varys
 or by the 
queen
. The stories only agree that the king is dead.
Arya wants to leave 
King's Landing
, but the seven city gates are either closed completely, open only to entering, or
closely guarded by 
Lannister
 guardsmen and gold cloaks, who search everything and ask questions. Once she
considered swimming the river, but the current is treacherous and she cannot afford a ferry or a ship. Arya imagines
that if she can escape to the countryside, she can dig for roots, find orchards, pick berries, and travel north.
There are pot shops in 
Flea Bottom
 where she can get her birds cooked or exchanged for some bread or stew, but the
people in them seem dangerous. Arya has even been chased a couple of times when leaving, probably for her boots
or cloak, but she outran them. She often goes hungry rather than endure the stares of the people in the pot shops. The
first night she spent on the street, her silver bracelet and her bundle of good clothes were stolen while she slept. All
the thieves left her were the clothes and cloak she was wearing, her practice sword, and her real sword “
Needle
,”
which she was sleeping on.
She misses her brothers. She tried to talk to the other children, but must have talked wrong (likely with a 
northern
accent) because the young ones all ran away and the older ones asked questions, called her names, or tried to steal
from her. One girl, twice her age, even knocked her down to try to steal her boots and was rewarded with a smack
from Arya's practice sword.
On her daily circuit to check the city gates, Arya decides to go to the riverfront on her way to the 
Mud Gate
 to see if
she might be able to stow away on a ship. The wharfs are too quiet. On a pier she sees men in the livery of
Winterfell
 guarding a ship. She learns from a passing longshoreman that the ship is called the 
Wind Witch
 out of
Myr
, which is the same ship that her father contracted to take her and 
Sansa
 home. As she approaches the ship, Arya

suddenly remembers to use the seeing that Syrio taught her again and realizes she does not know the guards. They
call to her and she plays the part of a boy trying to sell them the pigeon, knowing they will recognize her if she runs.
The ploy works and they send her away dismissively.
Somehow, Arya finds her way back to Flea Bottom and discovers her pigeon is gone, either stolen or dropped. Then
she hears the bells of 
Baelor's Sept
 and wonders what it means this time. From one of the passersby she hears that it
is a summoning and from another she hears that the gold cloaks are carrying the 
Hand of the King
 to the sept.
Arya follows the masses. All around her the townsfolk are discussing 
her father
 and the rumors of his treason. She
pushes through the crowd and finds herself next to the statue of 
Baelor the Blessed
, the 
Septon
 King, and climbs up
so she can see. From this vantage point she can see her father supported by two gold cloaks in a rich velvet doublet
and a grey cloak, his face drawn with pain and thinner than Arya has ever seen. With him on the pulpit are the 
High
Septon
, King 
Joffrey
, Queen 
Cersei
, 
the Hound
, four other members of the 
Kingsguard
, 
Varys
, 
Littlefinger
, and
Sansa
; Arya wonders why Sansa is there and why she looks so happy.
Then her father makes a speech in which he confesses that he betrayed the trust of King Robert. A stone from the
crowd strikes him, causing a gash on his face and more stones follow. The High Septon intones that Blessed Baelor
taught mercy along with justice and asks Joffrey for his verdict. Joffrey declares that his mother and his betrothed
have requested that Lord Eddard be allowed to 
take the black
. Then he declares that while he is king treason shall
never go unpunished, and calls for Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 to bring him Eddard’s head. This causes an uproar around Joffrey
as the High Septon, Cersei, and even Varys protest the decree.
Arya jumps to the ground, drawing Needle, but the crowd quickly engulfs her. She sees Ser Ilyn raise 
Ice
—he has
Ice!—and hears Sansa screaming. She continues to fight toward them, using Needle to cut a path. A hand shoots out
to grab her and hold her tight, forcing her to drop her sword. The smelly old man who has grabbed her tells her not
to look and calls her a boy. Then she hears a soft sighing noise.
Arya looks at the smelly man and recognizes him as 
Yoren
 of the Night’s Watch, who talked with her father. He
tells her to keep her mouth shut and that she is coming with him. Yoren shakes her hard when she tries to speak.
Once the crowd starts to disperse, he hands her back Needle, saying that he hopes she can use it. He keeps calling
her a boy and does not give her the opportunity to deny it, insisting that she is trying to say she is not a smart boy.
Yoren shoves her inside a doorway and a blade flashes at Arya’s face; she wrenches back her head but cannot
escape because Yoren has a strong grip on her hair.

Bran I
Bran
 and 
Rickon
 have the same dream about seeing 
their father
 in the 
crypt of Winterfell
. 
Maester
 
Luwin
 takes Bran
down to the crypts to show him his father is not there. They find Rickon already there. They go back to the
maester’s turret where Luwin tells them about the coming of the 
First Men
, the treaty with the 
children of the forest
and the coming of the 
Andals
. A raven arrives with news of Lord Eddard’s death.
Synopsis
Bran
 is watching Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
 train the new young recruits in the yard of 
Winterfell
. 
Maester
 
Luwin
 is taking
measurements of the comet through his lens tube. Bran comments that the recruits do not fight very well, and is told
that Lord 
Eddard
 took the cream of the guard with him to 
King's Landing
 and then 
Robb
 took the rest along with all
the likely men for leagues around; men are needed to walk the walls of 
Winterfell
. Bran stares resentfully at the boys
below, remembering how he knocked Prince 
Tommen
 down many times. Then Bran suggests that he could fight
from 
Hodor
’s back, but Luwin dismisses the idea as impractical. Bran talks about the blind knight 
Symeon Star-
Eyes
, but Luwin insists that that is only a story and that Bran must put his dreams aside.
The mention of dreams reminds Bran of his new dream of the 
three-eyed crow
, a dream that was very sad. He tells
Luwin how the crow brought him down to the crypts and his father was there. His father was sad because of 
Jon
.
When he woke up, Bran wanted to go down to the crypts to see if his father was there, but 
Hodor
 would not take
him. Luwin tells Bran that Eddard will be down there someday, but not be for many years. Bran insists the dream
was real and that his father was there. In order to dispel the boy’s delusion, Maester Luwin calls for 
Osha
, who tells
them that she has lived 
beyond the Wall
, so a hole in the ground will not scare her. Because of Osha’s good
behavior, her chains have been removed, but the shackles remain to show she is not totally trusted. She carries Bran
in her arms, but he does not mind.
The vault seems very dark and gloomy. Summer and Osha seem uncomfortable. When Bran states that the men
represented by the granite statues were the 
Kings of Winter
, Osha tells him that winter has no king; if he had seen a
winter he would know. They proceed down the long corridor, past the statues, but Summer refuses to leave the steps.
Bran tells the accomplishments of the different lords and kings: 
Jon Stark
, 
Rickard Stark
, 
Theon Stark
, 
Brandon the
Shipwright
, 
Brandon the Burner
, 
Rodrik Stark
, 
Torrhen Stark
, and 
Cregan Stark
. When they get to the end with the
statues of 
Brandon Stark
, 
Lyanna Stark
 and Lord 
Rickard Stark
, Luwin sticks his arm into the future tomb of
Eddard, and 
Shaggydog
 springs out and savages Maester Luwin's arm.
Bran calls for Summer, who slams into Shaggydog, knocking the wolf off Luwin. Osha goes to assist Luwin. As the
wolves fight, Rickon appears at the mouth of Eddard’s tomb, telling Luwin to leave his father be. When Bran tells
Rickon father is not there, Rickon states that he saw him last night, and that he is coming home. Luwin, now looking
unsure, tells Rickon that Shaggydog was supposed to be chained. Rickon replies that he does not like to be chained,
and Luwin states that he is now the third man Shaggydog has savaged and it will only be a matter of time before he
kills someone. Bran calmly states they will wait in Maester Luwin's tower, which Luwin states is quite impossible.
Osha replies that Bran is the lord. Rickon agrees to come if Shaggy comes too. Maester Luwin reluctantly follows.
They enter Maester Luwin's cluttered turret, where Osha bandaged the maester's wound, following his instructions.

Luwin tries to explain to the boys about the logic of them both dreaming the same dream. He says that Rickon is too
young to understand, to which Rickon states that he is four. Then he tells Bran that he is old enough to know that
dreams are just dreams. Osha adds in that some dreams are just dreams and some are not; the 
children of the forest
could teach him something about dreams.
Bran starts to go into the stories that 
Old Nan
 told about the children of the forest: they knew the songs of the trees,
flew like birds, swam like fish, talked to animals, and made beautiful music. The maester says that a man who trusts
in spells duels with a glass sword. Luwin takes out several arrowheads made of 
dragonglass
, or 
obsidian
, which the
children of the forest forged. He tells them that the children used shirts of woven leaves and greaves of bark in place
of armor and carried blades of obsidian; Osha comments that they still do. Bran and Rickon each take some
arrowheads.
'The children lived during the 
Dawn Age
, before the coming of men in the land now called the 
Seven Kingdoms
.
They lived in the depths of the woods, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Their wise men were called
greenseers
 and carved the faces in the 
weirwoods
 to watch over the forest. No one knows how long they reigned or
where they came from.' Twelve thousand years ago, the 
First Men
 crossed the 
Broken Arm
 of 
Dorne
 before it was
broken. The First Men were mounted, tall of stature, and wielded bronze weapons.
The First Men chopped down the weirwood trees to build holdfasts, and the enraged children of the forest started a
war. The 
greenseers
 supposedly used dark magic to make the sea rise and break the landmass that is now the broken
arm of 
Dorne
. Finally, a truce was called and the leaders of both races met on the 
Isle of Faces
 in the 
Gods Eye
.
After the 
Pact
 was forged, the greenmen formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces and the First Men eventually
adopted the 
old gods
 worshiped by the children. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age and began the 
Age of
Heroes
. The Pact started 4000 years of friendship between the children and the First Men. While the kingdoms of
the First Men endured, so did the Pact, all through the Age of Heroes, the 
Long Night
, and the birth of the Seven
Kingdoms.
Eventually the 
Andal
 invaders came with steel, fire, and the seven-pointed star of the 
new gods
. The war lasted for
hundreds of years, and the Andals burned most of the weirwoods remaining in the south, slaughtering the children
where they found them. The children fled north. During the story, Osha adds that there are still children north of the
Wall
, and also giants, and other old races; Maester Luwin is not happy with Osha filling the two boys with folly.
Luwin’s tale is cut off when the two 
direwolves
 start howling. Now Bran is sure that he knew it. The direwolves
quiet and a bloodied messenger raven appears. Even Maester Luwin is not sure he wants to know what is in the
message. Bran, hugging Rickon hard, asks about the message and Osha tells him he knows, while putting a hand
gently on his head. Maester Luwin reads the message and tears up as he tells them that they will need to find a stone
carver that knew their father’s likeness well.

A Clash of Kings
Sansa I
Sansa
 is in a depression after the execution of 
her father
. 
Joffrey
 arrives to browbeat her into attending him in court.
After court, Joffrey takes her to the ramparts to see the heads of her father and household. For a fleeting moment,
Sansa has the opportunity to push Joffrey off the wall, but it disappears too soon.
Synopsis
Sansa
 stays in her room in 
Maegor’s Holdfast
, sleeping, sobbing, and sleeping again. She does not eat the food the
servants bring. When she dreams, she relives 
her father’s
 beheading. She remembers wanting to look away, but not
being able to. She remembers that all the people were screaming and she remembers 
Joffrey
 smiling and feeling safe
until he said those words.
Sansa believes she will be executed and the thought does not bother her; she knows songs will be sung about her.
She even considers throwing herself from her window, but cannot summon the courage and runs back to her bed
sobbing. She dreams of footsteps that belong to Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 coming for her with 
Ice
. In the dreams, when Ser
Ilyn is at her door she realizes she is naked, and covers herself and screams out that she will be good.
Finally, Joffrey arrives with 
the Hound
 and two others of the 
Kingsguard
. Joffrey throws the curtains of the bed
open and tells her that she will attend him in court that afternoon. Sansa begs him to leave her be, but Joffrey
threatens to have his Hound force her. When she does not move, he orders the Hound to get her out of bed. She
struggles as her blankets fall away to show that she only wears a thin bed gown. The Hound then tells her “Do as
you are bid, child; dress.” He pushes her to the wardrobe almost gently.
She tells Joffrey that she did as she was asked and now only wants to go 
home
. Joffrey tells her that he is still to
marry her, so she will stay here. She responds that she does not want to marry him because he killed her father
despite promising mercy. Joffrey insists he was merciful: he gave her father a clean death. Sansa now truly sees
Joffrey for the first time, and cannot believe she ever found him handsome. Sansa whispers that she hates him.
Joffrey tells her that his mother has said he should not strike his wife, so he orders Ser 
Meryn Trant
 to strike her
with the back of his gloved fist. Sansa sprawls to the floor, her ear bloody. She agrees to attend court and everyone
but the Hound leaves. The Hound tells her that she should save herself some pain and give Joffrey what he wants:
she is to smile, smell sweet, and be his lady love.
Two maids creep timidly into the chamber. Sansa instructs them to prepare a bath and to get powder to hide the
bruise on her face. She is amazed at how dirty her bathwater becomes, not having washed since her father’s
execution. She chooses the green silk gown she wore at the 
Tourney of the Hand
 when Joffery was sweet to her—
maybe he will remember and be gentle.
Ser Meryn escorts her to the throne room. From her observation of Ser Meryn, Sansa realizes that he feels nothing
towards her; she is only an object. Sansa tells Ser Meryn that he is no true knight, which she thinks the Hound would
find amusing, but she gets no reaction.
She is alone on the balcony as Joffrey dispenses what he considers justice. Mostly he lets his 
small council
 make the

decisions, but when he intervenes he will not be dissuaded. She sees the ugly face of 
Janos Slynt
 at the council table
and remembers how he threw down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead. She also notices how he nods approvingly at
each of Joffrey’s brutal judgements. She wishes some hero would cut off his head but knows there are no heroes,
remembering 
Petyr Baelish
 telling her that life is not a song. Sansa thinks “In life, the monsters win.” The last case
is a singer accused of singing a song ridiculing King 
Robert Baratheon
. He is made to sing the song before the court
and Sansa thinks it is funny; in some verses it seems like he is singing about the queen. Joffrey gives the man the
option of keeping his fingers or his tongue.
When the court is dismissed, Sansa flees the balcony only to be met by Joffrey, Ser Meryn, and the Hound. Joffrey
examines her and tells her she looks much better. Sansa thanks him with hollow words. Joffrey then tells her to walk
with him—the touch of his hand now makes her skin crawl. He asks her what she will get him for his coming name
day, but Sansa admits that she was unaware it was near. Joffrey tells her that she is truly a stupid girl, and that his
mother has said so and is worried their children will be stupid as well. Despite her expectations, the words still hurt
Sansa and she realizes that the Hound was right: she is “only a little bird, repeating the words they taught her.”
Joffrey then tells her that he will get her with child as soon as possible, and if the child is stupid, she will lose her
head and he will find a smarter wife. He asks when she can have children and she tells him, not being able to look at
him, that Septa 
Mordane
 told her twelve or thirteen.
Sansa now realizes they are going up onto the battlements and begs not to go there. Joffrey insists that he wants to
show her how traitors are punished. He also threatens to have Ser Meryn drag her if she refuses. The Hound
encourages her to go and Sansa realizes that one way or the other she must go up, so she goes willingly. It seems
like she climbs a thousand steps to the top. Sansa looks out across the city to the countryside beyond and lets her
imagination cross the hundreds of leagues north to her home in Winterfell. Joffrey demands to know what she is
looking at and instructs her to look at the heads of her father, her septa, and a dozen more. Her father’s head does
not look recognizable or even real. Sansa decides that they can make her look, but they cannot make her see. Joffrey
is disappointed by Sansa’s hollow and stoic reaction.
Sansa cannot understand why they would kill Septa Mordane, but Joffrey insists she was a traitor as well. He asks
again what Sansa will give him for his name day as a preamble to declaring that instead he will bring Sansa the head
of her traitor brother 
Robb
. Joffrey explains that Robb used treachery and deceit to defeat his 
Uncle Jaime
. Sansa
suggests that Robb may give her Joffrey’s head. This mistake results in two harder blows by Ser Meryn. Joffrey
commands her to clean off the blood.
For a fleeting moment, Sansa realizes that it would only take a shove to send Joffrey over the parapet to splatter far
below. Just as suddenly, the moment is gone when the Hound comes between her and Joffrey to dab the blood from
her broken lip with surprising gentleness. She thanks the Hound; she is a good girl and remembers her courtesies.

Daenerys
 has terrible nightmares during her long recovery. She wakes to learn that 
her child
 was born dead, a
twisted monstrosity. When she visits with Drogo he is comatose, but 
Mirri Maz Duur
 insist that he is alive.
Daenerys is horrified by the cost of the bloodmagic. That night, she attempts to revive Drogo, but by morning knows
he is gone forever and smothers him with a pillow.
Synopsis
In her dreams, 
Daenerys
 keeps hearing, 
“You do not want to wake the dragon, do you?”
 She is walking down a hall,
her bare feet leaving bloody footprints. Suddenly she is with 
Drogo
 under the open sky of the 
Dothraki Sea
. Drogo
is stroking her, waking her passion, and when he enters her the stars are gone, great wings fill the sky, and the world
takes flame. Then she sees Ser 
Jorah’s
 drawn and sorrowful face telling her that the last dragon was 
Rhaegar
Targaryen
 while standing over a hot brazier containing red-hot stone eggs. In turn, he is replaced by 
Viserys
 with his
molten gold crown screaming 
“The dragon does not beg, slut,”
 and 
“I will be crowned.”
 Then he painfully pinches
her nipples and suddenly Daenerys is frantically running to a distant 
red door
 that is her salvation. She knows that
the darkness is there, but she does not dare look back or she will be lost. She sees 
her son
 as a grown warrior, proud
and tall, before flames consume him. Then the 
ghosts of kings
 are lining the hallway urging her to go faster. Then
she is flying over the 
Dothraki Sea
, and all are fleeing before her. She finally throws open the red door to see her
brother Rhaegar, the last dragon, in his armor, but when she opens his visor she sees her own face.
Daenerys wakes to the taste of ashes, with 
Jhiqui
 standing over her. Her body hurts very much. She calls for
something, but does not know what. Jhiqui says “Yes,” and bolts from the tent shouting. When they return,
Daenerys is crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah carries her back to bed and tells her to sleep and then 
Mirri
Maz Duur
 gives her something in a cup. A dreamless sleep takes her.
It is dark when Daenerys wakes again. She calls for her handmaidens and they attend to her. They tell her that she
has been sick for a long time. Then Mirri Maz Duur gives her wine and as she falls asleep, asking for a dragon’s
egg. The next time she wakes, Daenerys has the pale dragon’s egg in her arms and it is warm. There is fine sheen of
perspiration on her that she names “dragon’s dew.” There is no fever and she feels strong. She calls for her
handmaidens and asks for a bath, Mirri Maz Duur, Ser Jorah, Drogo, and her child. Her handmaids avoid answering
about Drogo and her child, and Daenerys knows that her child is dead.
Mirri Maz Duur and Ser Jorah enter to find Daenerys standing over the other eggs, which are all warm. However,
when asked, Ser Jorah does not feel the heat from the eggs. Ser Jorah looks gaunt and limps from his wounds. He
tells Daenerys that her son never lived, but Mirri Maz Duur tells her that the child was monstrous: lizard-like, with
scales; his skin fell off, revealing a body filled with grave worms and the stink of corruption, as if he had been dead
for years. She states that her son was strong when Ser Jorah brought her into the tent. Mirri Maz Duur explains that
death was in the tent and that the shadows touched her.
Daenerys realizes that Ser Jorah killed her child by taking her into the tent, for love and loyalty to her. Daenerys
states that she thought the life of the horse would be payment enough and is told that was a lie she told herself.
Daenerys is not sure if she knew. Daenerys realizes that the life of the horse, her son, 
Quaro
, 
Qotho
, 
Haggo
, and
Cohollo
 paid for the life of Drogo. She asks to see what the price bought. Ser Jorah cannot dissuade her and has to

help her stand since she is weaker than she thought.
Outside, in the glaring sun, Daenerys can see there is little left: a scattering of tents, a few score of horses, and
perhaps a hundred people. They are the old, the frightened, and the sick. 
Jhogo
 reminds her that a 
khal
 who cannot
ride is no 
khal
. She learns that 
Ko
 
Pono
 declared himself 
khal
 first, and 
Jhaqo
 after him. They took most of the
riders, the herds, and the slaves because Daenerys’ own 
khas
 was too weak to stop them; it is the right of the strong
to take from the weak. Most of the rest left during the following nights. 
Mago
, now a 
bloodrider
 to Khal Jhaqo,
seized 
Eroeh
 (whom Daenerys had denied him) and raped and murdered her. Daenerys repeats her mantra, “If I look
back I am lost,” and swears that Mago and Jhaqo will die screaming. Irri warns her that Jhaqo now has 20,000
riders, but Daenerys insists that she is 
the blood of the dragon
. Then she asks to see Drogo.
Drogo lies unmoving, unseeing, and covered in 
bloodflies
. Daenerys asks why he is outside alone and Ser Jorah
explains that he seems to like the warmth and staring at the sun with eyes that cannot see. He will follow where led
and eat if food is put in his mouth, but otherwise does nothing. Daenerys faces Mirri Maz Duur, who insists that
Drogo 
is
 alive. Daenerys responds that such is not life for a man that was as alive as Drogo. Then Daenerys asks
Mirri Maz Duur when Drogo will be as he was. The 
maegi
 replies,
“When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like
leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.”
Daenerys sends the others away and then accuses Mirri Maz Duur of knowing, of cheating her and murdering her
child. Mirri Maz Duur replies that it was wrong of the 
khalasar
 to burn her temple, and now the 
Stallion Who
Mounts the World
 will burn no cities and trample no nations. Daenerys reminds the 
maegi
 that she saved her, but
Mirri Maz Duur asks what Daenerys saved when three warriors had already raped her, burned her home and her
temple, and cut off the heads of her neighbors and friends. Daenerys insists that she saved her life, but the 
maegi
tells her to look at her 
khal
 and see what life is worth when all else is gone. Daenerys orders her men to bind Mirri
Maz Duur and take her away; the woman only smiles at her.
Daenerys orders Drogo brought into her tent. She bathes him herself and washes his hair until darkness falls. She
thinks of their first ride beneath the open sky and of when they made 
Rhaego
. She is too raw from the miscarriage
for intercourse, but uses other means in an attempt to use the magic of love to bring Drogo back. It does not work
and her husband remains comatose. When dawn breaks, Daenerys kisses Drogo for the last time, and then smothers
him with a soft silk pillow.

 bemoans Jaime’s decision to split his army into three camps, but Ser 
Kevan Lannister
 explains
calmly that Riverrun’s position at the fork of the 
Tumblestone
 and the 
Red Fork
 forces any besieger to do just that,
placing one army north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and one between the two rivers to the west.
Jaime’s army had no warning. Few of their outriders returned and those who did had seen nothing. The blame for
their disappearance fell on a small raiding force commanded by 
Marq Piper
 and Jaime rode out personally to deal
with them in the Whispering Wood and did not return. Robb’s force attacked the north camp first during the night.
The Blackfish
 led the attack, cutting down the sentries. When Lord 
Andros Brax
 saw that the northern camp was
under attack, he led the men of the western camp across the Tumblestone in rafts to join the battle. However, the
current pushed them downstream into range of the catapults of Riverrun. Many of the rafts were sunk or overturned
and Lord Brax was drowned by his heavy plate armor. Those few who reached the far bank found the enemy waiting
for them. Ser 
Flement Brax
, Lord Brax’s son, is disquieted to hear of the death of his father.
The camp between the rivers was overwhelmed as well. While Lord Brax was attempting to cross, two columns of
armored horse swept in from the west led by Robb Stark himself with his 
direwolf
 at his side. A few 
Lannister
pikemen managed to hold against the first charge, but Lord 
Tytos Blackwood
 led a sortie from Riverrun to take
them from the rear. 
Greatjon Umber
 fired the siege towers and Lord Blackwood liberated the prisoners, including
Ser 
Edmure Tully
.
The south camp, under the command of Ser 
Forley Prester
, was able to retreat in good order back toward the 
Golden
Tooth
 with 2,000 spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi 
sellswords
 in his camp struck their banners and went
over to the enemy. Kevan curses Jaime for not heeding his warning about mercenaries.
Ser Harys exclaims that all is lost. Jaime’s host is all destroyed or put to flight and the Starks and 
Tullys
 now stand
astride their supply lines, cutting Lord Tywin’s host off from their supplies and their 
homeland
. Robb Stark can even
march on 
Casterly Rock
 if he wishes. Ser Harys insists that they must sue for peace. At that, Tyrion shatters his wine
cup against a wall, declaring that Ser Harys will have better luck drinking from his broken cup than making peace

with Robb Stark now that 
Joffrey
 has beheaded 
Eddard Stark
.
Ser 
Addam Marbrand
 insists that two battles do not make a war, while Lord 
Leo Lefford
 suggests a truce and an
exchange of prisoners. Tyrion only scoffs that the Starks hold far more prisoners than they do and that Eddard
Stark’s head will not get his brother Jaime back; Robb is winning. When Lefford mentions that they hold Robb’s
sisters, Marbrand states that only an utter fool would exchange two girls for Jaime. Tyrion also shoots down
Lefford’s suggestion of a monetary ransom, declaring that the Starks can melt Jaime’s armor if they need gold. Ser
Harys then suggests that they get their friends in the court to join them and to raise a new host at Casterly Rock.
Lord Tywin has been even quieter than usual. After reiterating that they have his son, Tywin orders everyone but
Tyrion and Kevan out.
Tyrion is going to ask for wine but his father gives him his, untouched. Lord Tywin tells Tyrion that he was right
about Eddard Stark: alive, Eddard could have been used to bargain a peace and buy time to deal with 
Robert’s
brothers. Tywin states the execution was madness and rebuffs Tyrion’s attempt to excuse Joffrey for his youth,
though at least Joffrey did not marry a 
whore
.
Lord Tywin explains that 
Varys
 has heard reports that 
Renly Baratheon
 has wed 
Margaery Tyrell
 and declared
himself king, with all the might of 
Highgarden
 and 
Storm's End
 behind him. Lord Tywin also informs them that
Cersei
 has commanded him to march to defend 
King's Landing
. Tyrion can tell that Tywin is not happy about being
commanded. Cersei has not told Joffrey of Renly’s claim, fearing her son will insist on leading the 
City Watch
against Renly and leave the city undefended against 
Stannis Baratheon
. Lord Tywin admits that, from the beginning,
he has considered Stannis the most dangerous, and yet the Lord of 
Dragonstone
 has done nothing; Varys has only
heard whisperings that Stannis is building a fleet, hiring sellswords, and seeking the counsel of a 
shadowbinder
 from
Asshai
.
Tywin then details their position on a map. With Jaime’s defeat, they are in a bad situation: 
Roose Bolton
’s
remnants are to the north, enemies hold the 
Twins
 and 
Moat Cailin
, and Robb Stark is to the west so they cannot
retreat to 
Lannisport
 without giving battle, while Jaime’s army has ceased to exist and 
Beric Dondarrion
 and 
Thoros
of Myr
 plague their foraging parties. Then there are Dragonstone, Storm’s End, and Highgarden to the south calling
their banners. Tyrion’s jest that at least 
Rhaegar Targaryen
 is still dead goes unappreciated. If they remain where
they are they might get caught between three armies. Tywin explains that he plans to go to 
Harrenhal
 to confront
Robb Stark. Ser 
Addam Marbrand
 will screen their movements, while 
Gregor Clegane
, 
Vargo Hoat
, and Ser 
Amory
Lorch
 with 300 men each will set fire to the 
riverlands
 south of the Red Fork.
Once Ser Kevan leaves to issue the orders, Lord Tywin offers to let Tyrion’s 
clansmen
 ride with Vargo Hoat, but
Tyrion wishes to keep them close. Lord Tywin insists that Tyrion must learn to control them then, because he will
not have King’s Landing pillaged. Tyrion does not understand until his father explains that he is sending him to
court to act as 
Hand of the King
 and clean up the mess Cersei and the 
small council
 have created. Lord Tywin goes
on to rant about the raising of 
Janos Slynt
, the dishonoring of Ser 
Barristan Selmy
--who lent honor to any man he
served--and the appointment of 
the Hound
 to the 
Kingsguard
. He also tasks Tyrion with bringing Joffrey under
control if Cersei continues to fail and gives instructions to execute any councilors who play Tyrion false. When
Tyrion asks why ‘‘he’’ is being sent, Tywin states it is because Tyrion is his son; Tyrion, however, thinks it is
because Tywin has given up Jaime for lost. As he leaves, Tywin commands that Tyrion is not to take 
his whore
 to
court.
Tyrion sits for a long while in the common room before going to his bed with Shae and whispering that he is of a
mind to take her to King’s Landing.

Jon I
Jon
 deserts in the middle of the night, determined to join his brother 
Robb
 in the quest for vengeance. South of
Mole's Town
, his friends catch up and bring him back. In the morning, 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
 reveals he knows
about the night’s events and convinces Jon to stay and join him on a 
great ranging
 
beyond the Wall
.
Synopsis
Late at night, 
Jon
 saddles a mare in the stables of 
Castle Black
. As he mounts up, 
Sam
 appears in the doorway,
insisting that Jon cannot do this. Jon warns Sam to get out of his way since he does not want to hurt him. When the
fat boy refuses, Jon spurs his horse and forces Sam to leap out of the way, stumbling and falling. The mare leaps
over Sam. As he heads south down the 
kingsroad
, Jon hopes that Sam has not hurt himself getting out of the way.
The whole castle is silent and there is no one to see him leave; all the sentries are atop 
the Wall
, looking north. Jon
trusts that Sam loves him enough to give him a head start. In truth, he does not believe the timid boy can summon
the courage to disturb the guards to wake the 
Lord Commander
 in the night. As he rides, Jon flexes his burnt hand,
appreciating having the bandages off.
Jon stays on the kingsroad in the moonlight, knowing that he must get as far from Castle Black as he can before
dawn, planning to then go overland to confuse the pursuit. When he fails to bring the Lord Commander’s breakfast
at dawn they will search his cell, discover 
Longclaw
, and know he has deserted. It was hard to leave the sword, but
in the end Jon followed 
Jorah Mormont
’s example. The thought of betraying old 
Jeor Mormont
’s trust bothers Jon,
but it cannot be helped. Jon is still not sure he is doing the honorable thing. Jon thinks that the southerners have it
easier; they can talk to their 
septons
 to help sort out right from wrong whereas the 
heart trees
 do not talk.
Once out of sight of Castle Black, Jon slows his pace to spare the horse. He hopes to trade her for a new one and
cannot do that if she is injured or blown. He will also require an entire set of new clothes; his black wool, leather,
and steel will draw the suspicions of everyone north of 
the Neck
. Once Maester 
Aemon
's ravens take flight, not even
Winterfell
 will offer refuge to him.
Yet fond memories of Winterfell are not why Jon has forsaken his vows. He is 
his father
’s son and 
Robb
's brother.
Maester 
Aemon
 was right about the pain of choosing, but 
Tyrion Lannister
 was also right about denying a hard
truth. Jon is done with denying the truth. For the rest of his life, he will be accursed and outcast but it will be worth
it so long as he lives long enough to join Robb in avenging their father. Jon even envisions the moment he will
reveal himself to Robb. Yet those visions stall at Robb’s reaction, when Jon cannot picture his brother smiling. Jon’s
mind flashes to the deserter that their father beheaded and to what his father told the deserter about vows. He
wonders what his father’s reaction might have been if that deserter had been his brother 
Benjen
; he thinks it must be
different. The thought of being rejected and executed does not bear thinking about, so Jon begins riding harder
again, as if to outrun his doubts. He does not fear death, but he does not want to die like that. He is not a true Stark
but he can die like one; let them say there were four sons.
As Jon approaches the lights of 
Mole's Town
, 
Ghost
 disappears, apparently to go hunting. Jon does not concern
himself, knowing the 
direwolf
 will follow at his own pace. Once he is well beyond the village, Jon stops to drink

runoff from the snow and finds his fingers ache worse than they have in days and he has a pounding headache. Since
his horse is lathered, he walks. Jon still has not seen his wolf and it concerns him. He decides to eat a sparse meal to
give Ghost a chance to catch up. As he is finishing, Jon hears horses coming from the north. Knowing they are too
close to outrun, Jon quickly takes cover with the horse in a grove of 
sentinel
 trees off the road.
As the riders ride up, Jon quickly recognizes the voices of the boys of his former training syndicate: 
Grenn
, 
Pyp
,
Toad
, 
Halder
, and 
Matthar
. Jon’s mare snorts, and Halder hears it as the others argue about where Jon might be, and
asks the others to be quiet. Jon realizes that Sam did not go to the Lord Commander but he did not go to sleep,
either. Jon is concerned that the other boys will be named deserters if they are not in their beds by dawn. Just as the
boys are about to pass him by, Ghost comes loping through the woods and spooks Jon’s horse, giving away his
position.
Jon first tries to flee but the boys are on him before he can. He draws his sword and attempts to frighten them into
backing down, but the boys are unafraid. Jon demands to know what they want and they explain they are here to
take him back where he belongs. Jon insists that he belongs with his brother Robb, but the others remind him that
they
 are his brothers now. Jon wonders why they cannot leave him in peace. They start reciting their vows, Jon
cursing them. Pyp moves his horse closer, and the others surround him. Pyp grabs the reins and tells Jon that he
must either come back with them or kill them. Jon knows can easily kill them all, but agrees to go back, cursing
them all. Ghost comes out of the trees and Jon glares at him, but Ghost’s eyes seem to have a knowing look. Pyp
notes that they have to hurry because they must be back before first light, otherwise the Lord Commander will have
all their heads. They make it back an hour before dawn. To Jon it no longer seems like home and he decides he will
bide his time before his next attempt and avoid the kingsroad next time.
The next morning as Jon is serving his breakfast, the Lord Commander reminds Jon of his comment that the things
men love destroy them and that the hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Then he comments that Jon looks weary
and asks if his moonlight ride was exhausting. When Jon expresses his surprise, Mormont explains that Maester
Aemon told him that Jon would leave, and that he told Aemon that Jon would come back. He adds that he knew
honor would bring Jon back. Jon points out that his friends brought him back, but Mormont replies that he did not
say it was Jon’s honor. He then tells Jon that he had a watch put over him, and that if his friends had not brought him
back, he would have been taken anyway.
Jon thinks his life is forfeit and declares he is not afraid to die. Mormont says he hopes Jon is not afraid to live
either, pointing out that if they beheaded every man who rode to Mole’s Town for the night only ghosts would guard
the Wall. Mormont also notes that Jon is plotting to desert again. When Jon keeps silent, Mormont asks if he thinks
he can actually bring his father back to life or make any difference to Robb’s war; each of Robb’s bannermen
command more swords than the entire Night’s Watch.
Mormont goes so far as to point out that his own sister, 
Maege
, and her daughters rode south with Robb, but that his
place is the Wall. Mormont asks where Jon believes his place is. Jon thinks that he has no place, no mother, and now
no father, but only says he does not know. Mormont says that he knows Jon’s place. The cold winds are rising:
Cotter Pyke
’s men have reported 
mammoths
 and 
huge misshapen tracks
 near 
Eastwatch
. 
Denys Mallister
 has
reported that the 
wildlings
 are abandoning their villages near the 
Shadow Tower
 and 
Qhorin Halfhand
 has taken a
captive who revealed that 
Mance Rayder
, the 
King-Beyond-the-Wall
, is massing his people in some secret
stronghold for an unknown purpose. Then the Lord Commander asks if Jon thinks his brother’s war is more
important than theirs is. He also asks Jon if he thinks it matters who sits the 
Iron Throne
 when 
dead men
 come
hunting in the night. Jon has to agree; he has never thought of it that way before.
Mormont goes on to say that he believes Jon and Ghost were meant to be here, because the blood of the 
First Men
,
who built the Wall, is strong in the 
Starks
 of Winterfell; they remember things other men have forgotten. In addition,
Ghost led them to the two wights. Some men, like Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
, might call that happenstance, but Mormont
stresses that Ser Jaremy is dead and he is alive. He wants Jon and Ghost with him when they go 
beyond the Wall
; he
wants to find 
Benjen Stark
, alive or dead.
When Jon asks what he means, Mormont declares that he will not sit meekly and wait for the snows to come. The
Night’s Watch will 
ride in force
 against the wildlings, 
the Others
, and whatever else is out there. Mormont plans to
command them himself. He continues that the Lord Commander’s steward also serves as his squire, but he does not
want to be looking over his shoulder. Therefore, he asks Jon:

Are you a brother of the Night’s Watch or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
Jon pauses to apologize mentally to all his family before declaring that he is Mormont’s man and that he will not run
again. Mormont expresses his approval and orders Jon to go put on 
his sword
 again.

Catelyn
 returns to 
Riverrun
 for the first time in many years. After meeting with her ailing 
father
, she seeks out 
Robb
in the 
godswood
. After praying with his bannermen, Robb calls a council to determine their next move. The council
argues for hours about which way to march and which king to support until 
Greatjon Umber
 gives a rousing speech
and the bannermen proclaim Robb the 
King in the North
.
Synopsis
To 
Catelyn
, it seems a thousand years since she left 
Riverrun
 by boat with an infant 
Robb
 to head north to 
Winterfell
for the first time. Now she is returning by boat across the 
same river
 with a son who wears plate and mail instead of
swaddling clothes. With them in the boat is 
Theon Greyjoy
, and in the boat following are 
Brynden Tully
, 
Greatjon
Umber
, and 
Rickard Karstark
.
As they draw near, the men on the walls cheer them as the banners of 
House Tully
 fly from every rampart, but
Catelyn cannot feel anything but sadness since she received news of 
her husband
’s death, and she wonders if her
heart will ever lift again. After passing under the wall through the wide Water Gate, they are greeted on the water
stair by Catelyn’s brother Ser 
Edmure Tully
 and Lord 
Tytos Blackwood
. A worn-looking Edmure embraces Catelyn,
expresses his condolences, and promises vengeance against the 
Lannisters
. Catelyn only says that it will not bring
Ned back, then states she has to see 
her father
.
She is escorted to her father’s solar in the keep, which is three-sided like Riverrun itself. Along the way, Catelyn
asks about her father, and--as expected--Edmure explains that he is dying. When Catelyn demands to know why she
was not notified, Edmure explains that with the 
Seven Kingdoms
 so volatile their father forbid it; if word had gotten
out that he was ailing, the Lannisters might have attacked. Catelyn immediately blames herself, remembering it was
she who sparked the war by 
arresting
 
Tyrion Lannister
.
The solar is also triangular with a balcony to the east from which the walls, battlements, and river fork can be seen.
Lord Hoster’s bed has been moved onto the balcony so he can sit in the sun and watch the rivers. He is shrunken,
looking much older and frailer than Catelyn remembers. Lord Hoster calls her “Little Cat” and tells how he wanted
to be awake when she arrived; he was afraid he would not wake again. He speaks weakly and is wracked by spasms
of pain. He defends his decision to keep news of his illness a secret, but admits that he was afraid he would die
before seeing her again, especially once the siege began. She tells him that Robb is here, they have 
Jaime Lannister
in irons, and Riverrun is free again. This leads Lord Hoster to tell her of the joy he had as he watched the 
battle
 from
the battlements.
Her father asks if it was Robb who won the battle and Catelyn tells him that it was. Then she mentions that Ser
Brynden was also an important figure. Lord Hoster seems surprised by the mention of the Blackfish and asks if 
Lysa
has come down from the 
Vale
 as well. Catelyn cannot lie and explains that Lysa is frightened and believes she and
her son are only safe in the 
Eyrie
. Hoster is very disappointed that he will not see her.
Lord Hoster agrees to see Robb, who he remembers has his Tully eyes. When Catelyn presses on to ask if he will

see his brother, her father asks if Ser Brynden has married anyone yet. Catelyn is saddened that her father cannot
allow the old feud to rest. She tells him that his brother has not wed, nor will he ever. Lord Hoster launches into a
weak rant, criticizing Brynden’s choice to defy him and never marry, saying that 
Bethany Redwyne
 is still waiting
for Brynden. Catelyn has to remind her father that Bethany Redwyne has long ago married Lord 
Mathis Rowan
 and
has three children. Her father states there were also offers from others, including Lord 
Jonos Bracken
’s daughter or
any of three by 
Walder Frey
. Catelyn tells how she would not have made it to Riverrun without Brynden, and her
father agrees that he was always a warrior. Lord Hoster agrees to see his brother later but he is too tired to fight now.
Hoster is asleep before Catelyn leaves the solar.
Brynden is talking with the Riverrun guards when Catelyn returns, but he anxiously asks about his brother, and
Catelyn confirms that he is dying. When Brynden asks if Hoster will see him, Catelyn conveys that he will but he is
too tired to fight. Ser Brynden only laughs that his brother will be chiding him about the Redwyne girl as they light
his funeral pyre. Catelyn smiles and asks where she can find Robb.
In the halls Catelyn finds Theon regaling the garrison an account of the battle and of how 
Grey Wind
 tore off a
man’s arm and drove the Lannister horses mad. When asked, Theon tells her that he believes Robb went to the
godswood
. She realizes that this is just what Eddard would do after a battle.
Catelyn finds Robb praying with those of his lords bannermen who hold to the 
old gods
, including the Greatjon,
Rickard Karstark, 
Maege Mormont
, 
Galbart Glover
, and Lord Tytos Blackwood (one of a very few followers of the
old gods south of 
the Neck
). She feels she should not disturb their prayers. As she walks through the godswood,
memories of her childhood beset Catelyn. Here her father taught her to ride, there Edmure fell and broke his arm,
and under that bower she and Lysa played at kissing with 
Petyr Baelish
 and he tried to tongue them with mint from
the godswood on his breath. As Robb rises from his prayers, Catelyn wonders if Robb--who has ridden into battle
and killed men with a sword--has ever been kissed in the godswood.
When he sees her, Robb declares that they must call a council. Catelyn tries to get him to see his very sick
grandfather, but Robb insists that first they must meet to discuss the news that 
Renly Baratheon
 has proclaimed
himself king. Catelyn says she had expected it to be Lord 
Stannis
 and Galbart Glover says they all did.
The meeting is held in the great hall at four long tables. Lord Hoster is too weak to attend, but the attendance
includes Edmure and the Blackfish with the Tully bannermen arrayed around them: Lord 
Jonos Bracken
, Lord 
Tytos
Blackwood
, Lord 
Jason Mallister
, Ser 
Marq Piper
, Ser 
Stevron Frey
, 
Karyl Vance
 (a lord now, following his father’s
death), and Lord 
Lyman Darry
, son of Ser 
Raymun Darry
. The smaller number of northern lords sits opposite: Robb,
Theon, Rickard Karstark (grief-stricken over the death of his two sons), Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and
Greatjon Umber.
The lords argue late into the night with every lord taking full advantage of his right to speak. 
Roose Bolton
 has
reformed their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Lord 
Tywin Lannister
 has crossed the 
Trident
 and is making
for 
Harrenhal
. Some lords favor marching east to meet Lord Tywin at Harrenhal. Marq Piper favors marching west
to 
Casterly Rock
. Jason Mallister suggests they simply stay athwart Lord Tywin’s supply lines and rest their troops.
Jonos Bracken proposes they pledge fealty to Renly and move south to join him.
Robb, speaking for the first time, insists that Renly is not the king. The lords protest that Robb cannot mean to hold
to 
Joffrey
, who executed his father. Robb insists that that makes Joffrey evil, but does not make Renly king; as the
youngest brother, Renly cannot be king before Stannis. That splits the room again, with some favoring Stannis and
some still favoring Renly who is crowned and has 
Highgarden
 and 
Storm's End
 to support him. Robb states he does
not know what to do since Joffrey is the true heir, but he executed 
his father
 based on a lie. Ser 
Stevron Frey
, old
Walder Frey
’s heir, suggests that they make peace and allow Renly and Joffrey to fight and oppose or submit to the
winner as they choose; Lord Tywin would welcome the truce and the return of his son. This is met with shouts of
outrage.
Catelyn suggests a peace. Robb reminds her that the Lannisters murdered her husband and that he will have no
peace with them, laying his sword on the table to emphasize his point. Catelyn points out that the war was started to
free Eddard and to protect the Riverlands. The Riverlands are now safe and no amount of vengeance will bring her
husband back. She wants her daughters safe, for Robb to be safe and ruling from 
Winterfell
, and to go home. Ser
Brynden questions what the terms of peace could be that would prevent another war in the near future. Rickard

Karstark and Jonos Bracken question what their sacrifices have been worth if peace is made now. Tytos Blackwood
notes that if they make peace with King Joffrey, are they not traitors to King Renly? Catelyn’s hopes of peace
shatter before her eyes.
The meeting breaks down into another argument of which king to support, until 
the Greatjon
 rises to his feet and
silences them all. He spits upon all the kings and declares that Renly and Stannis are nothing to him. He asks why
they should rule over him and his from some flowery seat in the south when they know nothing about 
the North
.
Even their 
gods
 are wrong. The Greatjon asks why they should not rule themselves again. It was the 
dragons
 they
submitted to and the dragons are all dead. Then the immense man points his two-handed greatsword at Robb and
proclaims:
There
 sits the only king I mean to bend 
my
 knee to, m’lords. The 
King in the North
!
The other bannermen all take up the call, even the river lords who have never been ruled from Winterfell. And for
the first time in 300 years, there is a King in the North.

Daenerys
 builds a funeral pyre for 
Drogo
 and places her dragon eggs among his treasures. When she attempts to
take control of the few remaining 
Dothraki
 as a 
khal
 would, she is refused. As night falls, Daenerys lights the pyre
and is drawn by instinct deep into the inferno. When the pyre dies, the others find her unburnt and nursing the first
three baby 
dragons
 in hundreds of years.
Synopsis
Daenerys
 and her 
khas
 build a funeral pyre for 
Khal
 
Drogo
, as is 
Dothraki
 custom. There is little wood in the land so
much of what they find is gnarled. They lay the logs in a square and fill the center with brush, grass, and bark
shavings. 
Aggo
 and 
Rakharo
 kill a stallion from their now meager herd so that Drogo might have a mount in the
afterlife; it is nowhere near as fine as Drogo’s 
red
, but there are few in the world that are. 
Mirri Maz Duur
 believes
that Daenerys is attempting to use bloodmagic to resurrect her 
khal
 and insists that without the proper spells the
blood is nothing. The 
maegi
 even goes so far as to offer assistance in exchange for being released from her bonds,
but Daenerys orders her silenced. On the platform they pile Drogo's treasures, but Daenerys does not let the weapons
she received as bride gifts be added, insisting they are hers.
Ser 
Jorah
 is wary of her intentions, and pleads with her to let Drogo go and come with him to see the wonders of the
east. Daenerys assures him that she does not plan to sacrifice herself on her husband’s pyre. When Ser Jorah calls
her “princess”, Daenerys insists that he call her “queen”; her brother, the king, is dead and everything that was his is
now hers.
Once the pyre is completed, Daenerys gathers her people together, now fewer than a hundred, and declares that they
will be her 
khalasar
. Among the crowd, she sees slaves and declares them free. She announces that any among them
are free to go, but that if they stay they shall always have an honored place among her 
khalasar
.
Daenerys turns to the three young warriors of her 
khas
 and gives each of them one of her bride gifts, naming them
ko
 and asking for their oaths as her 
bloodriders
: to 
Jhogo
 she gives the silver-handled whip, to Aggo the double-
curved black dragonbone bow, and to Rakharo the gold-chased 
arakh
. However, none of them are willing to take the
oath: Jhogo replies that this is not done and it would shame him to be a woman's bloodrider, Aggo states that only a
man can lead a 
khalasar
 and name a 
ko
, and Rakharo only promises to take her to 
Vaes Dothrak
 to join the 
dosh
khaleen
. Daenerys ignores the refusals. Finally, Daenerys turns to Ser Jorah and promises him a fine 
Valyrian steel
blade when she comes into her 
birthright
. Ser Jorah swears his fealty and heart to her and Daenerys proclaims him
the first of her 
Queensguard
.
Daenerys returns to her tent, knowing the Dothraki think her mad and not sure that they are wrong. After a
pleasingly steaming hot bath, she is dried and perfumed. Daenerys sends her handmaids away so that she might
prepare Drogo for his final journey. She thinks about how few Dothraki men die with their hair uncut as she washes
him, braids his hair with bells, and dresses him in fine clothes and the worn vest he liked most. She finally asks him
to forgive her, and declares that she paid the price, but it was too high. She then dresses in fine clothes with a vest
like Drogo’s. The sun is setting when she calls them back to bear Drogo to the pyre.

Daenerys orders oil poured over the pyre, and then orders her handmaidens to fetch her dragon eggs. Something in
her voice makes them run. Ser Jorah protests that Drogo will have no need of dragon eggs, urging Daenerys to sell
them and live as a wealthy woman for the rest of her days. Daenerys insists that the eggs were not given to her to
sell. Daenerys climbs the pyre to place the black egg under Drogo's arm, near his heart, the green beside his head,
and the cream-and-gold between his legs. Once the eggs are in place, Daenerys gives her love one last kiss.
Climbing down, Daenerys notices Mirri Maz Duur watching her and hears the 
maegi
 call her mad. Daenerys only
asks how far madness is from wisdom and commands that Mirri Maz Duur be bound to the funeral pyre by Rakharo
and Ser Jorah, who hesitates and protests. The woman does not scream or plead as she is bound. As she pours the oil
over the 
maegi
’s head, Daenerys thanks her for all she has taught her. Mirri Maz Duur promises that Daenerys will
not hear her scream. Daenerys insists that she will, but that she only wants the 
maegi
’s life, echoing the woman’s
own words: “Only death can pay for life.” This brings a flicker of what might be fear to 
maegi
’s face for the first
time.
They wait for night to fall. It is Jhogo that first notices the 
red comet
, the first star of the evening. Daenerys sees this
as a sign to light the pyre. Mirri Maz Duur sings in a high, ululating voice at first, but her voice becomes a wail as
the flames engulf her and she soon falls silent. The Dothraki and Ser Jorah back away as the smoke grows thicker
and the heat stronger, but Daenerys stands her ground; she is the blood of the dragon and undeterred by the fire. She
knew the truth long ago, but the brazier was not hot enough. Then Daenerys begins to slowly walk towards the fire
as sweat covers her body. She sees many images as she walks: trees, animals, and a great grey stallion. Seeing the
horse she tells Drogo to mount, and for a second she sees him mounted. He smiles at her and cracks a whip made of
flame down upon the pyre and Daenerys hears the crack of breaking stone as the pyre collapses, showering her with
ash, cinders, and broken egg shell. Behind her, she can hear the Dothraki and Ser Jorah shouting. As the pyre begins
to collapse completely, Daenerys hears two more cracks like the first and walks into the heart of the fire.
When the fire dies, Ser Jorah finds Daenerys, naked but alive and unburnt except for her hair, nursing two baby
dragons
, with a third draped across her shoulders. The dragons match the colors of their eggs: 
cream-and-gold
,
green-and-bronze
, and 
black-and-scarlet
. Ser Jorah drops to his knees wordlessly. He is followed by Jhogo, Aggo,
and Rakharo who declare her blood of their blood, and then her handmaidens and the rest of the Dothraki do the
same. Daenerys knows that they are now hers as they never were Drogo’s.
Daenerys rises and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night comes alive with the music of dragons.

Arya I
Maester 
Cressen
 broods on the omens all around him on 
Dragonstone
. When news arrives that the 
storm lords
 will
not support 
Stannis Baratheon
’s quest for the 
Iron Throne
, Cressen comes into conflict with Queen 
Selyse
 and the
red priestess 
Melisandre
 over what course to take. In a desperate attempt to kill Melisandre, Cressen shares poison
wine with her, but dies while she remains unaffected.
Synopsis
Maester 
Cressen
 watches from his balcony as the 
red comet
 spreads across the dawn over 
Dragonstone
 like a wound
in the sky. The feeble 80-year-old chides himself for considering it an omen, yet he has never seen a comet so bright
nor of that color. It is even visible during the day now. At the same time, hot steam has begun to issue from vents
beneath the Dragonmont volcano, and a 
white raven
 has arrived from the 
Citadel
, declaring the end of the longest
summer in living memory (10 years, two turns and 16 days); too many omens to deny. It is enough to make any man
believe in omens, but the old 
maester
 cannot decide what they might mean.
Cressen’s eventual successor Maester 
Pylos
 interrupts his thoughts with word that Princess 
Shireen
 wishes to see the
white raven. The title “princess” is a new appellation for the young girl, now that her father, 
Stannis Baratheon
, is a
king. Cressen bids Pylos to show her in. The shy princess enters, followed by her shuffling fool 
Patchface
, who
wears a mock helm made from a bucket with antlers and cowbells. Perhaps once Patchface was a good fool, but now
he has lost his wits and is incoherent as often as not. Only Shireen laughs at his antics or cares about him at all.
Shireen’s face is unattractive even discounting the disfigurement from a bout of 
greyscale
 that nearly claimed her
life as an infant. Shireen asks to see the white raven, and the maester will not deny her since she has been denied too
much during her life of almost ten years. She is the saddest child the maester has ever known and he considers her
another mark of his failures.
While Pylos goes to fetch the white raven, Cressen thinks how the solemn 25-year-old Pylos is not a good match for
Dragonstone because grim places need lightening. However, a maester does not choose his post, and Cressen recalls
coming to Dragonstone himself 12 years ago with his lord, though he never liked it here and never considered it
home. Of late, when he wakes from restless nightmares of the 
red woman
, Cressen often does not know where he is.
Cressen asks Shireen why she is up so early. The girl explains that she had nightmares of dragons coming to eat her.
The maester remembers that she has always had nightmares. Thinking of the many dragon-inspired statues and
buildings of Dragonstone, Cressen attempts to comfort her by explaining that Dragonstone was once the
westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of 
Valyria
. The dragon towers were created to make the fortress seem
more formidable. He explains that the Valryians had long-forgotten ways of shaping stone and used them to make
the thousands of stone dragons on the island. Shireen is unconvinced, telling him that the red woman says the thing
in the sky is dragon’s breath. Cressen explains that it is only a comet and will be gone soon.
Shireen states that her mother says the white raven means it is not summer any more, and the maester confirms that
it is true. He then goes on to tell her about the white ravens, and how the Citadel has determined that summer is
over. Cressen says that it is hoped that there will be a warm autumn with bountiful harvests. He knows that a long
summer is said to bring a long winter, but does not want to frighten the child. When she asks if it will snow, the
maester says it will, but he prays it will not be for years yet. Then, Pylos returns with the white raven, and the
maester introduces the raven to Shireen. Shireen is delighted to learn that it can speak.
Patchface begins to sing, “The shadows came to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,” hopping from one
foot to the other, “The shadows came to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.” He jerks his head with each
word, and his bells make a clangor. Shireen declares that Patchface has been singing that song often lately and it

scares her. She asks the maester to make him stop. Cressen thinks back to how the old Lord 
Steffon Baratheon
 found
the fool in 
Volantis
 while seeking a wife for 
Rhaegar Targaryen
. Upon their return journey, within sight of 
home
,
their ship sank, killing everyone aboard. Patchface was washed up on the shore three days later, naked, cold, and
clammy. They took him for dead, but then he coughed up water and survived, albeit broken in mind and body,
hardly capable of speech let alone wit. Many suggested that it would be kindest for Cressen to let the mad boy die,
but he refused, and now he wonders at that decision. Cressen assures Shireen that Patchface is just rambling and
does not comprehend any of what he says.
Pylos, who went to fetch Cressen’s breakfast, returns to inform him that Ser 
Davos Seaworth
 returned during the
night and has been with Stannis most of the night. Cressen complains that he should have been notified, as it is his
duty to advise the king. Asking pardons of Shireen, the old man has Pylos help him hobble with his bad hips to the
Stone Drum, the main keep of Dragonstone. He passes windows from which he can see 3,000 men in the camp
outside the wall, and the anchorage filled with ships since no ship that has come within sight of Dragonstone has
been allowed to leave.
Once inside the Stone Drum, Cressen leaves Pylos, stating he wants to see Stannis alone. As he ascends the stairs he
regrets leaving Pylos. He meets Ser Davos coming down the stairs. Davos reveals that his mission as envoy to the
Stormlands
 has been a failure. It is as Cressen warned: the lords sworn to 
Storm's End
 have no love for Stannis and
will not support his claim. Instead, they have joined with the lords of the 
Reach
 in supporting Stannis’ younger
brother, 
Renly
.
News of Renly claiming the crown leads Cressen to worry for the youngest 
Baratheon
. When Ser Davos mentions
that Renly has instituted a 
new Kingsguard
, Cressen recalls that Renly was always fond of games and rich bright
fabrics as a child. “Look at me, I’m a dragon,” and “Look at me, I’m a wizard,” the boy was always shouting.
Cressen sees Renly’s bid to be king as no more than another game: “Look at me, I’m a king!”
Cressen asks Davos if he could bring Stannis any hope, but Davos insists that the only hope he could bring would
have been the false sort. This leads Cressen to recall that Ser Davos was once a notorious smuggler who sailed a
black ship past a 
Redwyne
 blockade in the dead of night to deliver onions and salt fish to Stannis’ starving garrison
during the 
Siege of Storm's End
. It allowed them to survive until Lord 
Eddard Stark
 could lift the siege. Stannis
knighted Davos for his deed. However, as punishment for his past misdeeds, Stannis himself cut short all the fingers
on Davos’ left hand save the thumb; Davos had insisted that Stannis do the cutting. Cressen realizes that a man like
that would give no false hope to Stannis. Ser Davos declares that if Stannis marches on 
King's Landing
 now, as is
his intent, with so small an army it will only be to die. Cressen responds that Davos has done all he can and that it is
now his turn.
Cressen finds Stannis in the top room of the keep, looking down at the 
Painted Table
, which is shaped as a detailed
map of the continent of 
Westeros
. Stannis greets him with the statement that he knew Cressen would come even
without a summons. He says that Cressen is now old and needs his sleep, and that he would have learned what
Davos knew on his own anyway. Talk between the maester and the king quickly turns into a rant by Stannis about
how the 
Baratheon
 birthright of Storm’s End, the Stormlands, and its income should have passed to him rather than
Renly when their brother 
Robert
 assumed the 
Iron Throne
. Stannis did not want Dragonstone, but when his brother
commanded it, he occupied it and built his brother’s fleets. It is an old grievance made new by the fact that
Dragonstone, ancient and strong though it is, commands the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords whose stony
island holdings are too thinly occupied to supply the men that Stannis needs to seize his rightful throne.
Cressen explains that Robert did him an injustice, but gave him lordship of Dragonstone because a man’s strength
was needed to hold it and Renly was just a boy. Stannis declares that Renly is 
still
 a boy, a thieving child who has
never done anything to deserve the throne. Stannis wonders aloud why the gods inflicted him with brothers. Then he
asks about the advice Renly gets from his maester, but Cressen doubts that Renly would seek council; Renly is bold
and heedless, much like Robert.
When Stannis asks what he is to tell the few anxious bannermen he does command, Maester Cressen reminds him
that 
House Lannister
 is his true enemy and suggests that he join with Renly to defeat them. Stannis flatly refuses.
Cressen yields immediately and suggests a partnership with the new 
King in the North
, 
Robb Stark
, who commands
all the power of 
Winterfell
 and 
Riverrun
. Stannis again refuses, claiming that Robb is a green boy and another false
king that seeks to steal half of his kingdom. Cressen suggests that half a realm is better than none and that Robb may

even submit in exchange for help in avenging his father, but Stannis remains adamant and launches into another rant
about the slights he received at the hands of his brother Robert:
“Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, 
Robert
 loved him, to be sure. Loved
him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known
by the way he treated me. I held 
Storm's End
 for him, watching good men starve while 
Mace Tyrell
 and 
Paxter
Redwyne
 feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked 
Stark
, for lifting the siege
when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name.
Did he ever take my hand and say, 
Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you?
 No, he blamed
me for letting 
Willem Darry
 steal away 
Viserys
 and 
the babe
, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council
for fifteen years, helping 
Jon Arryn
 rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my
brother name me his 
Hand
? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor.
And small good it did either of them.”
Cressen then proposes a marriage pact between Shireen and young 
Robert Arryn
. Stannis dismisses the possibility of
bringing the weak and sickly Robert to Dragonstone, as planned before Lord Arryn’s death, because 
Lysa Arryn
 is
paranoid and hides him in the 
Eyrie
. Cressen urges him to send Shireen and her fool to the Eyrie instead—
Dragonstone is a grim home for a child. Stannis now agrees that it is worth a try.
Then Stannis’ wife, Queen 
Selyse
, arrives to argue that Stannis should not have to beg or bargain for help; they all
owe their allegiance to him as the true king. Queen Selyse has been entirely converted to the worship of the foreign
god 
R'hllor
 by the red priestess 
Melisandre
 of 
Asshai
. Stannis tells her he needs swords, and asks whether she has an
army. She replies that 
House Florent
 can provide an army, but Stannis retorts that they can only provide 2,000 men,
and are too close to 
Highgarden
. The queen proclaims that the 
comet
 is an omen from the Lord of Light that He will
aid Stannis in his conquest. Stannis, who does not share his wife’s newfound faith, questions how many men the
Red God will deliver him. Selyse insists that R’hllor will provide all the power of 
Highgarden
 and 
Storm's End
.
Stannis reminds her that those men now support Renly. Selyse agrees, but suggests that if Renly should die, his
army would join Stannis. She then notes that Melisandre has looked into the flames and seen Renly dead. Cressen is
horrified by the notion and pleads that fratricide is evil. Stannis declares that he has heard Cressen’s advice and will
now hear hers, and sends the aged maester away.
By the time Cressen joins Pylos at the bottom of the steps, he can hardly stand erect, and needs to be helped back to
his rooms. There, Cressen contemplates his options. He raised Robert, Stannis, and Renly after their father died, and
cannot watch one kill the other. He knows that everything Queen Selyse said has been preached to her by
Melisandre, the red priestess. It is she who must be silenced before she can convert King Stannis to her evil schemes
and spread her mad religion beyond Dragonstone.
Therefore, Cressen goes to a small workroom under the rookery stair and retrieves a small vial of purple crystals, a
poison known in Westeros only as 
the Strangler
. Dissolved in wine, one of the small crystals is enough to cause the
victim's throat muscles to constrict more tightly than any fist, making it impossible for the victim to breathe. Cressen
plans to put one in Lady Melisandre’s drink at the feast Stannis is holding for his bannermen tonight. He knows it is
a dreadful thing he is planning, but surely the gods will forgive him. As he lays down for a nap, Cressen wonders if
the comet is his, foreboding murder.
Hours later, Cressen wakes to discover he has overslept and is late for the feast. He calls for Pylos, who should have
awoken him, but Pylos does not come, so he has to shout for the servants. As he crosses the long gallery, the comet
outside the windows looks malevolent to him, but he thinks he should not fear. When he enters the great hall, he
finds Stannis and his bannermen have begun without him. As Cressen crosses the room, Patchface the fool lurches
into him while singing the same song from the morning and they both fall to the floor. Face-to-face with Cressen,
the fool says “Under the sea you fall up, I know, I know.”
Cressen is too feeble to rise on his own, but fortunately strong hands lift him to his feet. When he turns to thank the
knight he believes helped him, he comes face-to-face with Lady Melisandre herself, clothed in red silk with red
eyes. The red priestess mockingly advises him to mind his steps, intoning her religion's prayer, “For the night is dark
and full of terrors.” Cressen insists that only children fear the dark. Melisandre gives him a riddle, “A clever fool
and a foolish wise man”, and places Patchface’s ridiculous antlered helm upon Cressen’s head, telling him “A crown
to match your chain, Lord Maester.” All around him, Cressen hears laughter. He removes the crown, fighting his

rage. He tells her he needs no crown but truth, to which Melisandre replies that some truths are not taught in Old
Town.
When he reaches the high table, Cressen sees that Stannis has given his accustomed seat to Pylos. When questioned
why he did not wake him, Pylos blushes and states he was told to let Cressen rest and that Cressen was not needed
here. Cressen looks at the gaudy knights and captains: aged and sour Lord 
Ardrian Celtigar
, handsome Lord
Monford Velaryon
, plump 14-year-old Lord 
Duram Bar Emmon
, homely Ser 
Axell Florent
, pious Lord 
Guncer
Sunglass
, and the Lysene captain 
Salladhor Saan
. Only Ser Davos Seaworth is simply dressed. Melisandre sits to
Stannis’ right, in the place of high honor. Of all the lords, only Davos will meet his gaze, with pity in his eyes.
Stannis declares that Pylos will now assume all of Cressen's duties, insisting that Cressen is too ill and confused to
be of use to him any longer. Cressen cannot believe it is Stannis’s voice that states this. Cressen is heartbroken by
the rejection, remembering how he was the one that loved Stannis as a boy, perhaps because Stannis was the one
who was unloved. Cressen accepts and meekly pleads for some place at the table, though he still feels he belongs at
Stannis’ side. Of all the assembled lords, only Ser Davos offers him a seat.
As Patchface continues to caper about, Ser Davos comments that they should wear motley, since they are about
fool’s business: Melisandre has seen victory in her flames and so Stannis plans to press his claim, no matter the
numbers. Cressen urges Stannis a final time to ally himself with Robb Stark or Lysa Arryn, but Queen Selyse insists
that R’hllor is the only ally Stannis needs. Cressen replies that gods make uncertain allies, and here R'hllor has no
power. Melisandre tells him that if he believes that he should put Patchface’s crown back on, and Queen Selyse
commands thus. Stannis grudgingly orders the fool to give the crown to Cressen. After the fool places the crown on
Cressen’s head, Selyse suggests that Cressen sing. Stannis refuses and declares that Cressen has served him well.
Suddenly, Cressen sees the opportunity to poison Melisandre. He is close to Davos’ cup, which he takes and slips a
crystal into. He is sure only Davos notices. Cressen proposes to Melisandre that they share a cup of wine to toast to
her god’s power. She agrees. Davos tries to stop him, but Cressen insists he is doing what he must for the sake of the
realm and his lord’s soul. Before they drink, Melisandre gives him the opportunity to back out, but Cressen refuses.
Melisandre drinks most of the cup, leaving only a small amount for Cressen. Cressen pushes away his fear and
drinks as well. The ruby at Melisandre’s throat glows as she insists that her god R’hllor does have power. Cressen
tries to reply, but his throat has already begun to constrict. Unaffected by the poison, Melisandre looks on with pity
as Cressen collapses and dies.

Arya II
Arya Stark
 is travelling north with 
Yoren
 of the 
Night's Watch
, disguised as a boy. When the orphan boy known as
Hot Pie
 tries to steal her sword “
Needle
,” Arya beats him bloody. Yoren takes her aside for punishment and reveals
that 
her father
 was supposed to be allowed to take the black, rather than be executed.
Synopsis
Arya used to think her nickname of “Arya Horseface” was bad, until the orphan boy 
Lommy Greenhands
 named her
“Lumpyhead” because of her lumpy, uneven haircut. Her head actually feels lumpy when she touches it.
When 
Yoren
 dragged her into an alley after 
her father
’s 
execution
, Arya was sure he meant to kill her. Instead, the
smelly old 
black brother
 had only cut her hair and promised to deliver her to her home at 
Winterfell
 when he and his
new recruits pass by. However, Yoren insisted that she pretend to be an orphan boy named Arry because half of the
new recruits would turn her over to Queen 
Cersei
 quick as spit for a pardon and a few silvers, and the other half
would do the same but rape her first. Yoren claimed it should not be too hard to pass as a boy; the hardest part would
be passing her water in the woods alone.
There are 30 of them; some of the recruits are orphan boys recruited with promises of food and clothing, but others
are criminals from the dungeons under the 
Red Keep
. The most frightening are the three from the 
black cells
, whom
Yoren keeps chained in the back of a wagon. The five wagons contain supplies for the Wall: hides, bars of pig iron,
a cage of ravens, cloth, books, paper, ink, 
sourleaf
, oil, medicine, and spices.
The gates of 
King's Landing
 were easy to pass, just as Yoren claimed. The 
Lannister
 guards were searching for the
highborn daughter of the 
Hand of the King
, not a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Yoren called one of them by
name and they were waved through. As they were leaving, Arya wished that 
Blackwater Rush
 would rise and wash
away the city until she remembered 
her sister
 would be washed away, too. Instead, she decided to wish for
Winterfell.
Yoren was wrong about passing water being the hardest part. The men ignore her, but the orphan boys Lommy
Greenhands and 
Hot Pie
 take her silence to mean she is frightened, stupid, or deaf. Arya is two years younger and
quite a bit smaller than them. One morning, Lommy and Hot Pie begin questioning Arya about her sword, “
Needle
,”
wondering where she got it. Hot Pie sarcastically suggests that maybe she was a squire, but Lommy disagrees and
argues that Needle is probably not even a real sword. Arya angrily shouts back that it is castle-forged steel, but this
only gives rise to claims that she stole it. This angers Arya even more because Needle was a gift from her bastard
brother 
Jon Snow
, and she will not let them call him a thief.
Then Hot Pie gets the idea that he can steal Needle from her and Lommy encourages him. Hot Pie’s declaration that
she doesn’t even know how to use a sword takes Arya back to the stable boy she stabbed during her 
escape
 from the
Red Keep
, but she doesn't mention the incident. The boys continue to mock her, saying that she is going to cry and
wet her pants.
The Bull
—an older boy with shaggy black hair and a bull-motif helmet—tells them to let her be, but Hot Pie

continues. Arya attempts to diffuse the situation by offering to surrender her wooden practice sword, but Hot Pie
threatens to beat her up like he did another boy and reaches for Needle. Arya uses her practice sword to whack Hot
Pie’s donkey. The animal bucks and throws Hot Pie to the ground. Arya dismounts and breaks his nose with her
practice sword before turning on Lommy, who cowers away in fear. The Bull shouts a warning and Arya turns to
face Hot Pie. The injured boy throws a rock at her, but Arya ducks and closes the distance to strike him again on the
hand, cheek, knee, and back of the head. Dazed and wounded, Hot Pie attempts to charge her, but Arya slips into a
Water Dancer
 pose and stabs the boy in the groin.
By the time Yoren pulls her off, Arya has hit Hot Pie a dozen more times and the boy’s pants are brown and smelly.
Yoren drags her off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering. There he orders her to drop her breeches
and scream loudly, then whacks her several times with her own stick sword. Arya does not want to scream, but
cannot help it, and her thighs and cheeks are ablaze with pain.
When he is finished, Yoren tells her that if she ever uses her stick sword on one of her companions again she will
get twice what she gives. Yoren also explains that however much her punishment hurt, Hot Pie is feeling much
worse. He points out that Hot Pie and Lommy had no part in her father’s death and hitting them won’t bring him
back. Arya says she knows that. Yoren goes on to explain that he was set to leave when he received a message to
wait for Lord Eddard, who was supposed to be allowed to take the black, only something went queer. Arya blames
King 
Joffrey
 and declares someone should kill him. Yoren replies that someone will, but not him and not her.
Afterward, Arya is unable to sit a donkey for several days, but Hot Pie is unable to do anything but lie in the back of
a wagon for even longer and Lommy stays as far away from her as possible. The Bull points out that Lommy
twitches whenever she looks at him now. Arya does not answer since it seems safer not to talk. That night, while
looking up at the sky, the Bull calls the 
red comet
 the “Red Sword,” saying that it looks like a sword fresh from the
forge. Arya can see it as a sword as well, but to her it is her father’s greatsword 
Ice
, covered with her father’s blood
as it was after his head was cut off.
When she finally falls asleep, Arya dreams of Winterfell. She longs to see 
her mother
, 
Robb
, 
Bran
, and 
Rickon
, but
more than anyone she misses her brother 
Jon
 on the Wall. She wishes that somehow they could come to the Wall
before Winterfell, just so she could see Jon again.

Synopsis
Sansa
 is watching the long tail of the 
red comet
 from her tower window when Ser 
Arys Oakheart
 arrives to escort
her to the 
tourney on King Joffrey's name day
. She asks him what it means. Ser Arys declares that it means glory to
her betrothed, King 
Joffrey
; the gods have raised it as a banner in his honor, and the smallfolk have named it “King
Joffrey’s Comet”. Sansa is not so sure and replies that she has heard the servants call it the “Dragon’s Tail.” Ser
Arys replies that Joffrey sits on 
Aegon the Dragon
’s 
throne
 and crimson is the color of 
House Lannister
, so it must
mean he will triumph over his enemies. Sansa wonders apprehensively if this is true, since her 
mother
 and 
brother
are among Joffrey’s enemies. Yet Joffrey is a 
Baratheon
 as much as a Lannister, so his comet should be gold.
Ser Arys compliments Sansa on her gown, whose long sleeves hide the bruises given to her by Ser 
Boros Blount
 at
Joffrey’s command when he learned that her brother 
Robb
 had been proclaimed 
King in the North
. Of all the
Kingsguard
, Ser Arys is always courteous to Sansa, and is her preferred escort since he is the only one who objects
to hitting her and never hits hard. The others all obey without question, except 
Sandor Clegane
, but Joffrey never
commands the 
Hound
 to hit her.
As they walk, Sansa asks who will win the tourney. Ser Arys states he will, though there will be only 40 contestants,
and there is small honor in unhorsing green boys. Sansa muses that this will be very different from the magnificent
Hand's tourney
. With King 
Robert
 dead and three kings vying for power it is not surprising that Joffrey’s tourney
must be held within the 
Red Keep
. Sansa asks if Queen 
Cersei
 will attend, but learns that the queen has urgent
business with the 
small council
. Ser Arys also mentions that Cersei is furious that 
Tywin Lannister
 will not bring his
army to the city as commanded.
The pitiful crowd in the small outer bailey fills only half the seats. Most of the spectators are 
gold cloaks
 or wear the
crimson of House Lannister. Only a few are nobility: grey-faced Lord 
Gyles Rosby
, Lady 
Tanda Stokeworth
 with
her daughters 
Falyse
 and 
Lollys
, the exiled prince 
Jalabhar Xho
, and Lady 
Ermesande Hayford
, who is only a baby.
The Hound announces Sansa’s arrival at the royal box. Princess 
Myrcella
 gives a shy nod, but Prince 
Tommen
excitedly tells her that he is to ride in the tourney. Joffrey quickly interjects that Tommen will be riding against a
straw quintain. After Ser Arys excuses himself, Joffrey studies Sansa and declares he is pleased she wore the stones
he gave her. Sansa is relieved that Joffrey has chosen to play the gallant today.
Once Sansa is seated, Joffrey informs her that the Beggar King 
Viserys Targaryen
 is dead. Joffrey is amused by the
irony of a 
dragon king
 being 
killed
 with a molten gold crown. He suggests that perhaps he will feed Sansa’s brother
Robb to wolves and boasts that he intends to challenge Robb to single combat. Sansa states that she would like to
see that. Joffrey is suspicious of her meaning, so Sansa distracts him by asking if he will compete today. Joffrey

responds that his mother claims it would not be fitting for him to compete in his own tourney, otherwise he would be
champion. When asked to concur, the Hound says, “Against this lot? Why not?” When Sansa asks the Hound if he
will joust, the scarred man replies that it would not be worth the bother, since this is a tourney of gnats. Joffrey
suggests he should make the Hound fight the champion to the death, but the Hound replies that Joffrey would only
be one knight the poorer (and the Hound is not a knight).
When the trumpets sound, Joffrey takes Sansa’s hand, which repulses her, but she forces herself to be still.
In the first joust, Ser 
Meryn Trant
 of the Kingsguard defeats Ser 
Hobber Redwyne
 on the second pass. The 
Redwyne
twins are hostages like Sansa, and she doubts they entered the tourney voluntarily. Joffrey is disappointed by the
poor show. Next, Ser 
Balon Swann
 faces the new-made squire 
Morros Slynt
, who is having difficulty with his lance.
The sight of 
Janos Slynt
’s heir takes Sansa back to the day her father was beheaded; it was Janos Slynt who threw
her father down and held him while Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 swung the sword. Her prayer for Morros to embarrass himself is
answered when the former commoner is violently unhorsed. Joffrey hoots in derision, telling Tommen that they
picked the wrong foe for him, Morros jousts worse than a quintain. Then it is Ser 
Horas Redwyne
’s turn. He fares
better than his twin, unhorsing an old knight bedecked with silver griffins who makes a poor contest. Disgusted,
Joffrey declares this a feeble show. He is getting bored and his mood is darkening, which worries Sansa.
Next, Ser 
Dontos Hollard
 is called to face the freerider 
Lothor Brune
. Brune takes his place, but Ser Dontos arrives
drunk and half naked, struggling to catch and mount his horse. The audience all laugh at the drunken knight’s antics
except for Joffrey. Eventually, Dontos gives up trying to mount, sits down in the dirt, forfeits the match, and asks for
more wine. Joffrey stands and shouts, “A cask from the cellars! I’ll see him drowned in it.”
Without thinking, Sansa protests and is immediately shocked that she dared, given Joffrey’s mood. He turns on her,
furious at being gainsaid, and Sansa struggles to make up a story that it is a curse to kill a man on one’s name day.
Joffrey does not believe her, but the Hound comes to her rescue by agree that, “What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps throughout the year.” Joffrey reluctantly agree to have the fool killed on the morrow. Sansa seizes the
opportunity to suggest that Joffrey make Dontos wear motley and clown for him as a fool instead of executing him;
he does not deserve the mercy of a quick death. Joffrey likes this idea and agrees. Ser Dontos thanks both Joffrey
and Sansa.
Once Ser Dontos has been led away, the master of revels inquires whether he should summon a new opponent for
Lothor Brune or proceed with the next tilt. Instead, Joffrey calls off the tourney in disgust, saying he would have
them all put to death if it weren't his name day. Tommen vehemently protests that he was supposed to ride against
the quintain. An argument among the royal siblings ensues. When Myrcella finally points out that their mother
agreed, Joffrey mocks her for being childish, but Myrcella points out that they ’’are’’ children. The Hound,
laughing, tells Joffrey that she has a point. Joffrey sullenly agrees.
Tommen’s opponent is a child-sized quintain wearing a helmet with antlers. Tommen hits it solidly, but it spins
around to strike Tommen on the back of the head, unhorsing him. This incites a gale of laughter from the crowd,
most of all from King Joffrey. Princess Myrcella rushes out to help her brother to his feet. Sansa, with queer
courage, suggests that Joffrey should accompany her to help and tell Tommen he rode well. Joffrey angrily refuses,
stating that getting unhorsed is not riding well. However, Tommen shows courage when he prepares to try again.
Sansa finds herself wishing that Tommen was the eldest child; she wouldn’t mind marrying him.
Just then, the portcullis rises and the gates of the Red Keep open. A column of dusty horsemen enter under the
golden lion banner of House Lannister. Some of the horsemen wear the armor of Lannister men-at-arms but the
majority are freeriders, sellswords, and 
monstrous savages
. In their midst rides 
Tyrion Lannister
, the ugliest man
Sansa has ever set eyes upon. Tommen and Myrcella rush to greet their uncle and Sansa is stunned to see that
Tommen and Tyrion are the same height.
After greeting his niece and nephew, the dwarf waddles over to Joffrey, shadowed by a 
black-haired sellsword
 and a
one-eyed savage
. When Tyrion greets him, Joffrey expresses surprise at Tyrion’s arrival and the Hound comments
that they heard Tyrion was dead. Myrcella expresses happiness that he is alive. Tyrion thanks her and then gives his
condolences to Joffrey and Sansa for the loss of their fathers. Sansa is speechless, wondering if Tyrion is mocking
her. Joffrey is momentarily confused until Tyrion reminds him that his own father, King Robert, has also recently
died. Joffrey responds “Oh, him. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.” Tyrion asks him if that is what ‘they’ say.

Sansa, armoring herself in courtesy, apologizes to Tyrion for his 
abduction
 by her mother. Tyrion thanks Sansa for
the sentiment, telling her that many people are sorry, and some will be even sorrier.
Then, Tyrion asks Joffrey where he might find Queen Cersei. Joffrey answers that she is with the small council;
Jaime Lannister
 keeps losing battles and was captured, 
Riverrun
 was lost, and Robb is calling himself king. Tyrion
comments that all sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days. Suspicious of the comment, Joffrey tells
Tyrion stiffly that he is happy he is alive, and asks about a gift for his name day. Tyrion responds that he has brought
his wits, and Joffrey replies he would prefer Robb’s head. Before Joffrey departs with Myrcella and Tommen, the
Hound tells Tyrion to guard his tongue. Sansa is left alone with Tyrion and his monsters.
Unable to think of anything else to say, Sansa comments on Tyrion's injured arm. Tyrion tells her that a northman
hit him with a morning star, but he escaped by falling off his horse. Tyrion asks if it is mourning for her father that
makes Sansa so sad. Sansa reflexively insists that her father, mother, and brother are traitors and that she is loyal to
her beloved Joffrey. Tyrion is unconvinced and responds by comparing her to a deer surrounded by wolves. Sansa,
without thinking, whispers “Lions.” The dwarf gently takes her hand and assures her that he is only a little lion and
means her no harm, then departs.
Sansa notes that Tyrion speaks to her more gently than Joffrey, but then she remembers that Queen Cersei once
spoke gently as well. She reminds herself that Tyrion is still a Lannister and that she must never trust a Lannister
again.

Tyrion II
Tyrion Lannister
 meets with the 
small council
 and assumes his position as acting 
Hand of the King
. After dismissing
the council, he and Cersei discuss all that has happened in King’s Landing, and Cersei grudgingly accepts him as
Hand. Later, Tyrion travels to the 
Broken Anvil
, where he has finds 
Varys
 has already discovered his mistress 
Shae
.
Synopsis
Outside the 
small council
 chamber, Ser 
Mandon Moore
 insists that Queen 
Cersei
 has left orders not to be disturbed.
Tyrion
 quips that he will only be a small disturbance and produces his letter from Lord 
Tywin Lannister
. Ser
Mandon remains unimpressed and expressionless, a trait which makes 
Jaime Lannister
 consider him the most
dangerous of the 
Kingsguard
 (besides himself), since his face never hints at his next action. Refusing to back down
on his first day, Tyrion introduces 
Bronn
 and 
Timett
. After Ser Mandon learns that Bronn 
killed
 Ser 
Vardis Egen
, he
allows Tyrion to enter. Tyrion relishes that he has passed his first test.
When Cersei sees him, she exclaims “You!” with equal parts disbelief and distaste. Taking care to act confident in
front of her, Tyrion remarks that he can see where 
Joffrey
 learned his courtesies. When Cersei asks why he is there,
Tyrion saunters over to deliver their lord father’s letter. 
Varys
 inspects the seal and proclaims it genuine before
Cersei snatches it. Cersei has taken the king’s seat, so Tyrion takes the Hand’s chair, which seems only appropriate.
Cersei declares the letter absurd and explains that her father has authorized Tyrion to act as 
Hand of the King
 in his
absence.
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 offers greetings, and Lord 
Janos Slynt
 declares that there is need of Tyrion with rioting in the
streets and a 
grim omen
 in the sky. Cersei lashes out that Slynt is the one in charge of keeping order and that Tyrion
would serve them better on the battlefield. Tyrion replies that he is done with fighting, preferring the finer things in
life. 
Littlefinger
 declares Tyrion a man after his own heart, which reminds Tyrion that he must have a talk with
Littlefinger about a certain dagger used in an 
attempt
 on 
Bran Stark
’s life.
Cersei is not happy to learn that Tyrion has brought only a few hundred men; she is worried that 
Stannis
 or 
Renly
Baratheon
 will attack the city. Then she declares that only the king can name a Hand, and Joffrey has named Lord
Tywin. Tyrion points out that Lord Tywin named him and recommends that Cersei take it up with him at 
Harrenhal
.
Tyrion requests a private moment with Cersei, and the other councillors excuse themselves. As he leaves,
Littlefinger asks about living arrangements. Tyrion says he plans to take up residence in the 
Tower of the Hand
.
Littlefinger declares Tyrion a braver man than him, considering the fate of the last two Hands. Tyrion corrects this to
four, explaining that 
Aerys
's 
last Hand
 died in the 
Sack of King's Landing
, and 
the one before him
 was burned to
death. The two before them were luckier in that they merely died penniless in exile. Littlefinger japes that in that
case he would sooner bed down in the dungeon than the Tower of the Hand, and Tyrion privately thinks that
Littlefinger might get that wish.
Once they are alone, Cersei asks why their father would ignore her royal command and inflict Tyrion on her. Tyrion
points out that Lord Tywin has a large army and can do that, nor is he the first to do so. Cersei threatens to call the
letter a forgery and throw Tyrion in a dungeon. Tyrion agrees that no one—not even their father—would protest, but

asks why Cersei would want to do such a thing when he has come to help. Cersei insists that it was their father’s
help she wanted, but Tyrion can tell that it is Jaime she really wants, so he promises that if she supports him he will
find a way to free Jaime. Cersei asks how, given that 
Robb
 and 
Catelyn
 
Stark
 are not likely to forget the beheading
of Lord 
Eddard
. Tyrion notes that Cersei still holds the Stark daughters, forcing Cersei to reveal that she only has
Sansa
; she sent Ser 
Meryn Trant
 to apprehend 
Arya
, but her 
dancing master
 interfered and the girl escaped and is
likely dead.
Tyrion asks Cersei if she trusts the small council, since their father does not; Joffrey’s short reign has been full of
follies and disasters, which suggests the king is getting some very bad counsel. Cersei concedes that Joffrey, always
willful, now believes that as king he is free to do as he pleases, not as he is bid. She explains that Joffrey was
instructed to allow Eddard Stark to 
take the black
 but took it upon himself to order Eddard killed, and Janos Slynt
and Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 were quick to take the command. Cersei also mentions that as a result, the 
High Septon
 is
accusing them of lying to him and profaning the 
Great Sept of Baelor
.
Tyrion then questions Cersei about Slynt, asking whose idea it was to make him Lord of Harrenhal and a member of
the small council. Cersei replies that Littlefinger made the arrangements; they needed the 
gold cloaks
 on their side to
stop Eddard Stark before he handed the throne over to Stannis Baratheon. Cersei adds that it was close even so; all
might have been lost if Sansa had not come to Cersei with her father’s plans. Tyrion expresses surprise that Sansa
would betray her own father's plans, but Cersei explains that the girl was in love with Joffrey and would have done
anything for him right up until he cut her father's head off and called it "mercy".
Tyrion also learns it was Varys who suggested Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 be removed as 
Lord Commander of the
Kingsguard
 when Joffrey wanted to blame someone for 
Robert
’s death. It freed the Lord Commander's post and
council seat for Jaime, and allowed Joffrey to throw a bone to 
the Hound
. A generous severance was provided, but
Selmy would have none of it and fled the city. Tyrion notes that he heard Selmy slew the two gold cloaks sent to
apprehend him, which Cersei blames on Slynt’s incompetence. Tyrion points out that Barristan the Bold is a living
legend who lends credibility to any man he serves. Cersei admits she did not think of that. Tyrion points out that
their father did, and that is why he sent Tyrion to bring Joffrey to heel.
Cersei argues that Joffrey will be no more tractable for Tyrion, but Tyrion points out that Joffrey might be more
inclined to listen if he feels threatened, something he doesn’t feel with her. Cersei insists that she will never let
Tyrion harm her son, but Tyrion assures her that he only means to threaten. Cersei admits it is worth a try, but
remains adamant that Tyrion do nothing without her consent. Tyrion agrees, then asks for an honest answer to who
killed 
Jon Arryn
. Cersei tells him she does not know, and goes on to say that Eddard Stark asked her the same
question and hinted that Jon Arryn suspected her of something she hesitates to mention. Tyrion earns a slap in the
face when he reveals that he knew about her incest with Jaime all along. Tyrion insist that he is not as blind as their
father and makes several rude comments that earn him more slaps until he finally warns her that he is getting angry.
Tyrion asks how King 
Robert
 was killed, and Cersei explains that 
Lancel Lannister
 gave him strongwine of three
times the normal potency before he faced the boar, which Cersei claims tasted like triumph when it was served at
Robert’s funeral feast. Tyrion, who rather liked King Robert, comments that Cersei was born to be a widow as he
rises to leave. Cersei objects that she has not excused him and presses for details about how he will free Jaime.
Tyrion tells her he does not know yet, but reminds her to make sure no harm comes to Sansa.
Outside, Timett has disappeared to explore the city, so Tyrion commands Bronn to find him and make arrangements
for the 
clansmen
 in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion commands 
Vylarr
, the captain of Cersei’s
household guard, to provide an escort for him to the 
Broken Anvil Inn
, hoping to remind the captain that his oath is
to 
Casterly Rock
 and not to Cersei alone. As he leaves the 
Red Keep
, Tyrion orders the spiked heads of Eddard
Stark and his household taken down and given to the 
silent sisters
. When Vylarr hesitates because King Joffrey
ordered them to remain, Tyrion warns him that if they are not removed one of the spikes will have his head.
As they ride through the city, Tyrion notices the effect 
the war
 is having on the common people. The markets are
full of ragged men selling their household goods, but bare of farmers selling food. There are guards at every shop,
and Tyrion notes that in lean times even bakers find sellswords cheaper than bread. Vylarr confirms that very little
food is coming into the city with the roads closed to south and west. Tyrion asks what Cersei has done, and is told
she has tripled the City Watch and has thousands of craftsmen working on the defenses, including the 
Alchemists'
Guild
 which has pledged ten thousand jars of 
wildfire
. The thought of so much wildfire makes Tyrion

uncomfortable, and he asks where the money is coming from, given that Robert beggared the realm. Vylarr explains
that Littlefinger has introduced a tax on entering the city. Tyrion considers this clever and cruel, since tens of
thousands are fleeing the war for the supposed safety of the capital. When they arrive at the inn, he dismisses Vylarr
and says he plans to stay the night.
Inside, Tyrion finds 
Shae
 sitting with several 
Black Ears
 and Varys. Tyrion is irritated that Varys found Shae so
quickly and wonders who might have betrayed him. Varys says that he had a sudden urge to meet Tyrion’s young
lady and Tyrion realizes that the eunuch is indirectly threatening him. The two exchange some veiled threats before
Varys asks if Tyrion has seen the red comet. Tyrion replies that he is short, not blind; on the 
kingsroad
 it seemed to
cover half the sky and outshone the moon. Varys tells Tyrion that on the streets it is called the Red Messenger, "a
herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.” Before Varys leaves, he poses a riddle to Tyrion:
In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a
little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it’ says
the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do
it’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me-who lives and who dies?”
Once Varys is gone, Shae asks if it is the rich man who lives. Tyrion is not so sure, saying it depends on the
sellsword. As they climb the stairs to their room, Shae has to wait for Tyrion. Tyrion notes that he still has to look
up to her even though she is only five feet tall, but he does not mind since she is so sweet. Shae quickly strips and
then teases Tyrion that without her he will never be able to sleep in the Tower of the Hand without masturbating,
and asks if that is why they call it the Tower of the Hand. She drags him to the bed, and they make fierce love.
Afterwards, Tyrion calls himself a fool; Shae is a whore and only after his coin. When Shae asks what Tyrion will
do as Hand of the King, he tells her, “Something Cersei will never expect. I’ll do... justice.”

Bran II
Prince 
Bran Stark
 contemplates the 
red comet
 and listens to the 
direwolves
 howling in 
Winterfell
, wondering about
the reasons behind it all. He resents his broken body and the arrival of 
Big Walder
 and 
Little Walder Frey
, whom he
blames for 
Summer
 and 
Shaggydog
 being locked up. When he tells 
Maester
 
Luwin
 about his wolf dreams, Luwin
gives him a sleeping draught to stop the dreams, but that night he dreams he is Summer trapped in the 
godswood
.
Synopsis
Bran
 prefers the stone window seat to his featherbed. Abed, the walls seem to press close about him. Although he
cannot walk, climb, hunt, or fight as he once did, Bran likes to watch the lights begin to glow all over 
Winterfell
 in
the evening and to hear the 
direwolves
 sing to the stars.
Of late, Bran often dreams of wolves. When they howl, Bran feels the direwolves are talking to him, brother to
brother. He can almost understand them, as if they are singing in a language he once knew but has forgotten. His
mother
’s new wards Big Walder and Little Walder Frey might be afraid of them, but 
Old Nan
 told him the 
Starks
have wolf blood, though it is stronger in some than in others. 
Summer
’s howls are full of grief and longing while
Shaggydog
’s are savage. Their voices echo around the castle and it sounds as if a whole pack haunts Winterfell,
instead of only two where once there were six. Bran wonders if the wolves miss their siblings, too.
When Bran asked why the wolves howl, everyone gave him a different answer. Ser 
Rodrik
 the 
castellan
 had no time
for such idle questions, 
Farlen
 the kennelmaster believed it was for freedom, 
Gage
 the cook said they wanted to
hunt, and 
Maester
 
Luwin
 thought they were howling at the 
red comet
 because they thought it was the moon. When
Bran repeated Luwin’s words to 
Osha
 the wildling, she declared that his wolves have more wit than his maester and
know truths Luwin has forgotten. When Bran asked her what the comet meant, Osha replied, “Blood and fire, boy,
and nothing sweet.” 
Septon
 
Chayle
 thought the comet was the sword that slays the season, which makes sense to
Bran since soon after the 
white raven
 came from the 
Citadel
 to announce autumn. Old Nan could not see the comet,
but claimed she could smell it and said it foretold 
dragons
. 
Hodor
 only said, “Hodor.”
Still, the direwolves howl. The guards curse, the hounds bark, the horses kick, the Walders shiver by their fire, and
even Maester Luwin complains of sleepless nights. Only Bran does not seem to mind. Ser Rodrik has confined the
wolves to the 
godswood
 after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell play tricks with sound;
sometimes wolves sound like they are right below Bran’s window and other times they sound like they are up on the
curtain walls. Bran wishes he could see them.
Bran can see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall, the Bell Tower, and the First Keep. Once Bran knew every
stone of those buildings inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys run
down stairs. Their rooftops were his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower were his special friends.
Then he 
fell
 and almost died. Bran does not remember falling, yet he supposes it must be true. When his eyes fall on
the weathered gargoyles atop the First Keep where it happened, Bran gets a tight feeling in his belly. Now he cannot
climb, walk, run, or swordfight, and his dreams of 
knighthood
 have soured.
Summer howled when he fell, and for long after he lay broken, and Shaggydog and 
Grey Wind
 joined in his grief;

Robb
 told him so before he went away to war. The night the bloody raven brought word of his 
father
’s death, the
wolves knew that, too. Bran wonders who the wolves are mourning now. Has some enemy slain the 
King in the
North
 who used to be his brother Robb? Or has his bastard brother 
Jon Snow
 fallen from the Wall? Has his mother
or one of 
his
 
sisters
 died? Or is this something else, as Luwin and Chayle and Old Nan think?
Bran thinks wistfully that if he were a direwolf he would understand. In his wolf dreams he can race up mountains
taller than any tower and stand beneath the moon with the entire world below him, as it used to be. Bran cups his
hands and begins howling like a wolf, hesitantly at first, but Summer gives answer and so he tries again. The noise
brings the guard called 
Hayhead
 to his door, but Bran only howls at him until he leaves.
Hayhead returns with Maester Luwin, who suggests Bran should be asleep. Bran insists that he is talking to the
wolves. When Luwin offers Bran assistance getting to bed, Bran insists he can do it himself with the iron bars
Mikken
 installed, but he does not want to sleep. Luwin insists that even princes must sleep, but Bran explains that
when he sleeps he turns into a 
wolf
. He asks if wolves dream. Luwin thinks so, but not as men dream. Thinking of
his father, Bran asks if dead men dream. Maester Luwin says some think so, but the dead are silent on the matter.
Then Bran asks if trees dream. Confused, Luwin says no, but Bran insists that they do and says he dreams of a
weirwood
 tree calling to him sometimes. Bran says the wolf dreams are better; he can smell, and sometimes taste the
blood.
This makes Maester Luwin uncomfortable, and he wishes Bran would spend more time with the other children. Bran
insists that he hates the other children, meaning the Walders. He reminds Luwin that he commanded them sent
away. Luwin grows stern as he explains that it is not for Bran to send his mother’s wards away, and asks where they
would go if they were turned out. Bran says they can go 
home
, since it is their fault he cannot be with Summer.
Luwin argues that Little Walder did not ask to be attacked, nor did Luwin himself. Bran reminds the maester that
Shaggydog was the attacker; Summer never bit anyone.
Luwin reminds Bran that Summer tore out a man’s throat in that very room, and claims the sweet pups have grown
into dangerous beasts. Bran suggests they should put the Walders in the godswood; the boys can play 
lord of the
crossing
 all they want, and Summer can sleep with Bran again. Bran complains that no one listens to him, even
though he is the prince. He is not even allowed to ride 
Dancer
 past the gate. Luwin insists that the 
wolfswood
 is full
of dangers, recalling Bran’s 
last outing
. Bran insists stubbornly that Summer would protect him and that princes
should be free to sail and hunt and joust. Luwin asks why Bran torments himself with these dreams and reminds him
that he is a boy of eight. Bran loses his temper and replies:
“I’d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa.
I’d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I’d fight beside him like Grey
Wind. I’d tear out the 
Kingslayer
’s throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over and everyone
would come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf...Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.
Maester Luwin attempts to reply, but Bran only howls louder until the maester concedes and departs. Howling loses
its savor once Bran is alone and he quiets. Resentfully, Bran recalls that he did welcome the Walders when they
arrived from 
the Twins
. Rickon was the one who threw the tantrum then, screaming that he wanted Mother and
Father and Robb, not these strangers. It was Bran who soothed him and welcomed the Freys. Even Maester Luwin
said he did well. Then they played the 
lord of the crossing
 game in a pool in the godswood.
The game was played with a log, a stick, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The lord of the crossing
stood in the middle of the water and was the only one who got to use a stick. The other players had to make up
speeches about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and
answer questions. They didn’t have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said “Mayhaps,” so the
trick was to say “Mayhaps” so the lord of the crossing didn’t notice, then knock the lord into the water and become
the new lord of the crossing. In practice, the game came down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into the water,
along with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone said “Mayhaps.”
Little Walder was lord of the crossing as often as not. He is Little Walder even though he is tall and stout with a big
belly. His cousin, Big Walder, is sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. The names came about because Big
Walder is fifty-two days older, so he was bigger at first. Big Walder explained that there were bunches of Walders at
the Twins, as well as a number of girls named Walda, all named after the boys’ grandfather, Lord 
Walder Frey
.

Bran watched wistfully while the Walders played the lord of the crossing game with 
Turnip
 the cook’s boy and
Joseth
’s girls 
Bandy
 and 
Shyra
. The Walders had decreed that Bran should judge whether people said “Mayhaps,”
but as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him. The shouts and splashes soon drew others: 
Palla
 the
kennel girl, 
Cayn
’s boy 
Calon
, and 
Fat Tom
’s son 
TomToo
. Before long everyone was soaked, muddy, and
laughing. Bran had not heard so much laughter since the bloody raven arrived. Bitterly, Bran told himself that no
one would be lord of the crossing but him if he could use his legs. Then Rickon came running into the godswood
with Shaggydog and wanted to play. Shaggydog obeyed the command to stay until the first time Little Walder hit
Rickon with the stick. Then, before Bran could blink, the black wolf attacked Little Walder.
Oddly, after that Rickon decided he liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again, but they play
monsters and maidens, rats and cats, and come-into-my-castle. They plunder the kitchens, race around the walls, toss
bones to the pups, and train with wooden swords. But when Rickon showed them the crypts under the castle, Bran
had screamed that Rickon had no right to show them a Stark place.
The door to the bedchamber opens and Maester Luwin returns with Osha, Hayhead, and a sleeping draught. Osha
scoops Bran up and carries him effortlessly to bed. Luwin assures Bran that the draught will give him a dreamless
sleep. Bran wants to believe him. After he has taken the draught, Osha lingers behind to ask if it is the wolf dreams
again. When Bran nods, Osha says he should not fight so hard, since maybe the 
old gods
 are trying to answer all his
talk to the 
heart tree
. Bran fades off to sleep before he can really reply, but when the darkness closes over him, he
finds himself moving silently through the godswood. Part of him knows it is only a dream, but even the dream of
walking is better than the truth of his bedchamber.
In his dream it is dark amongst the trees but the comet lights his way as he moves, swift and strong on four good
legs. He can feel the ground underfoot and the smells fill his head. The scent of squirrel reminds him of the taste of
hot blood and bones cracking between his teeth. Slaver runs from his jaws, and he can hear the squirrel chittering
and rustling safe above him. He can smell his brother, too, loping around and around, tirelessly searching but never
finding: for prey, for a way out, for his mother, for his littermates, for his pack.
Behind the trees the walls rise higher than any wolf can leap. Cold iron and splintery wood close off the only exits,
but his brother still stops at each one to fruitless bare his fangs in rage. He did the same the first night, but learned it
was no good; circling the walls will not push them back and marking the trees will keep no men away. The world
has tightened around them, but beyond the wall still stands Winterfell, and beyond that the true world calls him, and
he knows he must answer or die.

Arya
 and the others encounter more refugees every day as they journey north. One evening they halt at an inn,
where they hear news of the war in the 
riverlands
. Outside the inn, Arya talks with the prisoner 
Jaqen H'ghar
. Soon
after, six 
gold cloaks
 arrive with an arrest warrant for the 
Bull
, but 
Yoren
 refuses and after a tense standoff the gold
cloaks retreat.
Synopsis
Each day, 
Arya
 and the others travel from dawn to dusk, and at night they eat by the light of the 
Red Sword
. The
men take turns standing watch, since they can see the firelight of other travellers. Every night there are more camps
and every day there is more traffic on the 
kingsroad
. They meet every kind of person and every mode of
transportation, but most come by foot, with their goods on their shoulders and wary looks on their faces. They are all
headed south toward 
King's Landing
, and Arya wonders why no one else is going north like them.
One morning, a passing merchant offers to buy 
Yoren
’s wagons for a quarter of their worth. He explains there is war
to the north and claims Yoren will do better selling to him than being robbed by soldiers, but Yoren refuses. That
same day, Arya notices the first grave (dug for a child) and a few leagues on 
Praed
 points out a whole row of them.
After that hardly a day passes without seeing one.
One night, Arya wakes to find the night oddly quiet. When Praed does not wake the next morning, Arya realizes it
was his coughing that was missing. They bury the sellsword where he slept and split his valuables amongst them.
Yoren gives the longsword to the Bull, claiming he has the arm to learn to wield it.
That evening they stop in a village at an ivy-covered inn. They cannot afford rooms, but Yoren arranges a hot meal
and use of the bathhouse if anyone feels the need. Arya knows she must smell as bad as Yoren, but cannot risk
revealing her gender by bathing. She rationalizes that it would be a shame to drown the creatures living in her
clothes that have come all the way from 
Flea Bottom
. The 
Bull
, 
Tarber
, and 
Hot Pie
 line up for the bathhouse with
some of the other men while the rest crowd into the common room. Yoren even sends 
Lommy
 out with tankards for
the three men who remain fettered in the wagon.
The innkeeper gives them all a round of beer on the house and tells them his brother 
Lync
 was sent to the 
Wall
 for
filching pepper from his 
lord
’s table. Arya sips her beer cautiously, remembering how she enjoyed beer when her
father permitted it and how 
Sansa
 would make a sour face and insist wine was ever so much finer. The memories
make her sad.
The inn is full of refugees who scorn Yoren’s plan to continue north. The innkeeper explains that half the fields are
burnt, and the remaining people are walled up in holdfasts. Yoren insists that the 
Night’s Watch
 takes not part, but
the innkeeper points out that 
wild men
 have come down from the 
Mountains of the Moon
 and the 
young Lord Stark
has come south to war. Mention of her brother grabs Arya’s attention. A man named 
Hod
 claims that Robb rides
into battle on a wolf as big as a horse, which no one seems to believe.
Then talk turns to the great pack of wolves near the 
Gods Eye
 who have even attacked men, led by a she-wolf from
the seventh hell. Talk of a she-wolf makes Arya wonder if the Gods Eye is near the 
Trident
, where she was forced to

leave her 
direwolf
 
Nymeria
. One of the travellers claims that this she-wolf once snatched a baby from its mother’s
arms in the midst of a village, and that the men who pursued lost all of their dogs and nearly their lives. Arya blurts
out that this is just a story because wolves do not eat babies. The man asks what Arya would know about wolves, but
Yoren gives her a shove and orders her outside before she can answer.
Outside, the youngest and handsomest of the three men in the wagon calls to her with a friendly voice. Arya
approaches warily with one hand on 
Needle
. The man is slender and fine-featured with red hair on one side and
white on the other. He speaks in a strange syntax, referring to himself as “a man” and to Arya as “a boy,” and his
accent reminds her of 
Syrio Forel
. He asks for another beer and suggests he could use a bath, claiming Arya could
make a friend. Arya insist that she has friends, but the noseless prisoner remarks that he cannot see any. The third
prisoner only hisses and sticks out the stump of his tongue.
The friendly prisoner begs forgiveness for his present company, and introduces himself as 
Jaqen H'ghar
 from
Lorath
. He introduces the noseless man as 
Rorge
 and the other as 
Biter
 (a name Jaqen gave the mute because of his
filed teeth). Rorge curses and throws his tankard at Arya, demanding more beer, but she manages to dodge. Asking
herself what Syrio would do, Arya draws her practice sword. Rorge threatens her, but Arya recalls her mantra, “Fear
cuts deeper than swords,” and approaches the wagon. When Biter lurches at her, Arya hits him hard right between
the eyes. Biter reels back but then throws all his weight against his chains and attempts to grab her again. When the
bonds hold and Biter collapses, Jaqen H’ghar observes that Arya has more courage than sense.
Arya backs away from the wagon again. When she feels a hand on her shoulder she whirls around, but it is only the
Bull, who reminds her that Yoren warned them not to go near the three in the wagon. Arya insists they do not scare
her, but the Bull replies, “Then you’re stupid. They scare me.” As the Bull leads her away, Arya hears Rorge
laughing and Biter hissing behind them.
Wanting to hit something, Arya asks if the Bull wants to fight. Startled, he warns her how strong he is, but Arya
argues that she is quick. The Bull draws Praed’s longsword and declares it cheap steal, but still a real sword. Arya
draws Needle and declares that it is good steel, which makes it even realer. They each ask the other to promise not to
cry if they get cut. Arya assumes her 
water dancer
's stance, but the Bull is distracted by six 
gold cloaks
 riding up the
kingsroad on lathered horses.
As the gold cloaks draw up in front of the inn, Arya pulls the Bull behind a tall hedge and tells him to be quiet as a
shadow. The gold cloak officer asks some of the recruits outside the bathhouse if they are the ones who left King’s
Landing to take the black. The men say they might be, so the officer dismounts and declares he has a warrant for a
certain boy.
Yoren steps out of the inn to ask who wants the boy. The officer presents his warrant and declares that Queen 
Cersei
sent them. Behind the hedge, the Bull asks why he and Arya are hiding. Arya explains that it her they are after. The
Bull asks why the queen would want her, but Arya tells him to be quiet. Yoren declares the warrant pretty, but
insists that the boy is in the Night’s Watch so what he did back in the city does not matter. The officer declares that
neither he nor the queen cares. Arya considers running, but knows she cannot escape. She decides she is tired of
running; a real water dancer would never run.
Yoren insists that the gold cloaks will have no one, since there are laws on such things. The officer draws his
shortsword and declares it his law. Yoren only looks at the blade and declares, “That’s no law, just a sword.
Happens I got one too.” The officer threatens that he has five men with him, but Yoren spits and declares that he has
thirty. A gold cloak with a broken nose laughs and asks who is first. In a gesture of solidarity, Tarber takes up a
pitchfork, 
Cutjack
 pulls out his hammer, 
Kurz
 draws his skinning knife, 
Koss
 strings his longbow, 
Reysen
 snatches
up his staff, 
Dobber
 (fresh from the bath) drops everything but his dagger, and 
Hot Pie
 scrambles to find a big rock.
Arya is amazed; she hates Hot Pie, so why would he risk his life for her?
Refusing to let the others die for her, Arya shoves through the hedge with Needle and joins the others. The gold
cloak with the broken nose laughs and tells her to put away the blade, calling her a girl. Arya insist she is not a girl,
furious that they do not understand she is the one they want. Yet when the Bull comes up behind her the officer
declares him the one they want. It is a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, however, and quick as a snake Yoren
places his sword at the officer’s throat.

Yoren declares that the gold cloaks will have neither of them, and reminds the officer that he has even more brothers
in the inn. The officer drops his sword and Yoren declares that good steel is always needed on the Wall. The officer
declares that Yoren had best hurry back to the Wall, and promises that if he catches Yoren again he will take his
head as well the boy's. Yoren declares that better men have tried and slaps the officer’s horse with his sword. The
other gold cloaks follow.
Once the gold cloaks are out of sight, Hot Pie whoops in triumph, but Yoren remains angry and orders everyone up
and moving; if they ride all night they may be able to stay ahead for awhile. After giving the officer’s sword to Hot
Pie, Yoren walks over to the Bull and declares that the queen wants him bad. Arya asks why the queen would want a
bastard boy like the Bull, but the Bull asks why she would want a gutter rat like Arya. Suspicious that the Bull is
more than he appears, Arya asks his true name. He replies that it is Gendry. Yoren claims not to know why anyone
would want either of them, but declares they cannot have them regardless. He orders Gendry and Arya to take the
two coursers and orders them to ride hard for the Wall at the first sight of a gold cloak, since the rest of them mean
nothing to the gold cloaks. Arya points out that the officer promised to take Yoren’s head, but Yoren replies that if
the man can take it he is welcome to it.

Jon Snow
 finds 
Samwell Tarly
 in the dark library cellar of 
Castle Black
, where Sam has found a number of maps for
the great ranging
. Out in the courtyard they watch the new recruits practicing and Jon talks with 
Donal Noye
. After
they present their maps, 
Lord Commander
 
Jeor Mormont
 discusses 
Maester Aemon
’s past with Jon.
Synopsis
Jon
 calls out to 
Samwell Tarly
 amidst the ancient books and scrolls of 
Castle Black
’s library. Jon wends his way
down the narrow aisles toward the glow of Sam’s lamp to find the fat boy hunched over a table. When Jon asks if he
has been there all night, Sam reveals that he lost all track of time in the windowless cellar. Jon calls Sam a sweet
fool and reminds him that soon they will be sleeping on hard ground, not soft beds. Sam yawns and explains that
Maester Aemon
 sent him to find maps for 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
, but he never thought there would be
thousands of interesting documents to read. Jon is unimpressed by the books and asks if Sam found the maps.
Sam gestures toward a clutter of books and scrolls on the table and declares he has found at least a dozen. He shows
Jon a faded parchment that marks the sites of many 
wildling
 villages. Then he excitedly shows Jon an account of a
ranging to 
Lorn Point
 by a ranger named 
Redwyn
 from before the 
Targaryen Conquest
 that mentions fighting with
giants
 and trading with the 
children of the forest
. Meaning to sound encouraging, Jon suggests that Sam can write an
account of their own 
great ranging
, but talk of what they are to face on the morrow makes Sam uncomfortable. He
shuffles scrolls about and says there are more maps if he only had time to set the library in order, which will take
years. Jon remarks that the Lord Commander wanted the maps a little sooner than that.
When Jon picks up a scroll it crumbles in his hand. Sam explains that the most important documents were copied
over when needed, and the oldest have likely been copied half a hundred times. Jon says there is no need to copy
this one, which is only a list of goods. Sam seems fascinated, but Jon wonders who would care how much pickled
cod men ate six hundred years ago. Sam insists that he would, since it can tell them how many men were in the
Night’s Watch
, and how they lived, and what they ate. Jon responds that they ate food and lived as he and Sam do.
Sam disagrees and claims that the vault is a treasure trove. Jon is dubious: to him treasure means gold, silver, and
jewels. Sam has also found works even the 
Citadel
 does not have: drawings of 
weirwood
 faces, thousand year old
counts of the seasons, scrolls from old 
Valyria
, and even a book about the language of the children of the forest.
Jon assures Sam the books will still be here when they return, but Sam replies, “If we return.” Jon tries to reassure
Sam by pointing out that Mormont is taking 200 seasoned men (most of them rangers), and 
Qhorin Halfhand
 will
join them with 100 more from the 
Shadow Tower
. He insists Sam will be as safe as back at 
Horn Hill
, but Sam
replies that he was never very safe there either.
Jon thinks it a cruel joke that 
Pyp
 and 
Toad
 (who want to go) are to remain behind while Sam (the self-proclaimed
coward) must go in Maester Aemon’s place to tend the two cages of ravens. Sam argues that Jon or 
Grenn
 could
care for the ravens, and Jon can write messages as well as he can. Jon insists that he has his own duties as the Lord
Commander’s steward. He reminds Sam that he said the vows, but Sam says that a brother of the Night’s Watch
should not be so scared. Jon insists they are all scared, and they should be with so many rangers disappearing in the
last two years, but what matters is how they face it. Then he offers to help gather up the maps and they depart the

library.
The vault opens onto one of the underground passages called the wormwalks, which bind Castle Black together in
winter. Jon thinks of the 
white raven
 that came to Maester Aemon, and knows winter will come soon. He remembers
the last winter, which was short and mild, but he can feel that this one will be different. By the time they reach the
surface, Sam is out of breath. The sight of 
the Wall
 reminds Jon that it marks the end of the world, and tomorrow
they are going beyond it.
The morning sky is streaked by clouds but the 
red comet
 is still visible behind them, even by day. The black brothers
have dubbed it “Mormont’s Torch,” claiming (only half in jest) that the gods have sent it to light the way through
the 
haunted forest
. The castle seems deserted with so many gone to the brothel in 
Mole's Town
. Grenn is among
them, since Pyp and 
Halder
 and Toad offered to buy him his first woman. They invited Jon and Sam as well, but Jon
insisted on keeping his vow of celibacy and Sam is as frightened of whores as he is of everything else.
As they pass the 
sept
, they hear a hymn being sung. Jon notes that on the eve of battle some men want whores and
some want gods. He wonders who feels better after. The sept tempts him no more than the brothel; the 
Seven
 have
no power beyond the Wall, but the nameless 
old gods
 whom Jon worships will be waiting there.
Outside the armory, Ser 
Endrew Tarth
 is training the six new recruits brought in the previous night. Ser Endrew is a
gentler master-at-arms than Ser 
Alliser Thorne
, but his lessons can still raise bruises. Sam winces at the sight, but
Jon watches closely. From the door of the armory, the one-armed smith 
Donal Noye
 asks Jon’s opinion of the
recruits. Jon declares they smell of summer and asks where 
Conwy
 recruited them. Noye says it was a dungeon near
Gulltown
 and labels the recruits as a brigand, a barber, a 
beggar
, 
two
 
orphans
, and a 
boy whore
. Jon replies that they
will do; he and Sam did.
Noye asks Jon if he has heard that his brother 
Robb Stark
 is now a 
king
. Jon admits that last night in the common
room there was talk of little else. Jon is still unsure how he feels about the brother he grew up with becoming a king
while he remains on the Wall, but he tells Noye that Robb will make a good king. Noye is not so sure and declares
that once he might have said the same of 
Robert Baratheon
, but Robert was never the same after he put on the
crown. Noye confirms that he forged Robert’s warhammer and claims he knew the 
Baratheon
 brothers as well as
anyone. The smith compares Robert to a sword: made for fighting and prone to rust if left unused. When Jon asks if
Robert’s brothers are the same, Noye considers for a moment then declares:
Robert was the true steel. 
Stannis
 is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets.
He’ll break before he bends. And 
Renly
, that one, he’s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth
all that much at the end of the day.
Jon wonders what metal Robb is, but decides it is best not to ask. Noye was a Baratheon man before taking the black
and likely believes Robb is a traitor. There is an unspoken pact amongst the Watch not to probe too deeply into such
matters since old loyalties are not easily forgotten. Even Sam’s former 
House
 is sworn to 
Highgarden
, which has
supported Renly. As Jon departs with Sam, Noye offers a prayer for Jon on the morrow and urges him to bring his
uncle
 back.
Jon leaves Ghost outside the door of the King’s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont resides now that fire has
gutted his own tower. Sam is disheartened by the number of stairs, but Jon jests that stairs are one thing they will not
confront beyond the Wall.
When they enter the solar, Mormont complains about how long it took them. Ignoring the boys, 
Thoren Smallwood
argues that the Lord Commander’s place is at Castle Black. Mormont declares that Smallwood can do as he likes if
he ever becomes Lord Commander. Smallwood insists that the command should be his as First Ranger, but
Mormont will have none of it. He declares that he already sent out two rangings and will not wait and wonder if the
third is lost as well. Mormont dismisses Smallwood with the reminder that Benjen Stark remains First Ranger until
his death is confirmed. Once Smallwood is gone, Mormont exclaims that he would sooner name Sam as First
Ranger and complains that Smallwood called him too old for a ranging.
Brusquely examining the maps, Mormont asks if they were all Sam could find. When Sam stutters, Jon points out
that the villages might be gone, but the geography will still be correct. Mormont asks Sam about the ravens and

commands that he wants the best, saying that if they are all butchered he means for his successor to know where and
how. Talk of butchery leaves Sam open-mouthed and speechless. Mormont declares he is too busy for such behavior
and dismisses Sam, who almost trips in his haste to leave.
Mormont asks, without waiting for an answer, whether Sam is as big a fool as he seems. He explains that he was
considering sending Sam as an envoy to King Renly, since his 
father
 stands high in Renly’s councils, but Renly is
not likely to heed a quaking fat boy so Ser 
Arnell
 (whose mother was a 
green-apple Fossoway
) will go instead. Jon
asks what Mormont would have of King Renly, and Mormont replies that he will take anything that is offered.
Mormont continues that Ser Alliser Thorne should reach King 
Joffrey
 soon, but 
House Lannister
 has never been a
friend to the Watch. Jon points out that Thorne does have the twitching 
wight
’s hand to show them. Mormont
laments they do not have a second hand to send to Renly. Jon remarks that 
Dywen
 claims a man can find anything
beyond the Wall. Mormont scoffs that Dywen also claims he saw a bear fifteen feet tall, insisting a man must
believe his own eyes.
Turning the conversation back to hands, Mormont asks Jon about his burned hand. Jon explains it is well enough to
wield 
Longclaw
 and that he is exercising the fingers as Maester Aemon suggested. Mormont opines that Aemon
knows his work and prays they can keep him another twenty years. Then he asks if Jon knows that Aemon could
have been king. Jon is taken by surprise; he assumed the maester was a younger son of a king.
Mormont explains that Aemon 
was
 a younger son, the third son of King 
Maekar I Targaryen
, who was himself the
fourth son of King 
Daeron II Targaryen
. Slow of sword but quick of wit, Aemon was sent to the Citadel when he
was nine or ten and ninth or tenth in the succession. Jon struggles to imagine the 100-year-old maester as a little boy.
Mormont continues that Crown Prince 
Baelor
 died in a 
tourney
 mishap and soon after his two sons, 
Valarr
 and
Matarys
 died in the 
Great Spring Sickness
 along with King Daeron, so the crown passed to Daeron’s second son,
Aerys I Targaryen
. Aerys reigned for twelve years (during which Aemon took his vows as a maester) then died
without issue and the throne passed to Aemon’s father Maekar I. During his father’s reign, Aemon’s eldest brother,
Daeron "the Drunken"
, died of a pox, leaving only 
a feeble-minded daughter
, and his second brother, 
Aerion
Targaryen
, who killed himself by drinking 
wildfire
, believing it would turn him into a 
dragon
. Less than a year later,
King Maekar died in battle with an outlaw lord.
A 
Great Council
 was convened to decide on the succession. It passed over Aerion’s infant son and quietly offered
the throne to Maester Aemon, but Aemon chose to abide by his vows even after the 
High Septon
 offered to absolve
him. Therefore, his younger brother, 
Aegon V Targaryen
, was named king, and became known as "the Unlikely"
because (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that
those dissatisfied with his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so he became a member of the Night’s Watch and
remained at the Wall while his brother’s descendents ruled as kings until 
Robert's Rebellion
 put an end to the line of
the 
Dragonkings
.
Mormont’s raven begins repeating the word “king.” Jon notes that the bird seems to like the word, and jests that
perhaps the raven believes Mormont should have a crown. Mormont declares that there are three kings already,
which is two too many for his liking.
Jon asks why Mormont has told him all this about Maester Aemon. Mormont explains that Jon and Aemon have
something in common: a king for a brother. Jon points out that they also share a vow. Mormont comments that if he
had a man for every vow he has seen broken the Wall would never lack for defenders. Jon says he always knew
Robb would be Lord of Winterfell, but Mormont insists that a king is a different thing:
They will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and
die in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You’ll have no wife, nor will
you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow.
Him they’ll call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go
unsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon... and I’ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it.
Jon asks what a bastard like himself might do if these facts did trouble him, but Mormont asks what Jon 
will
 do. Jon
declares that he will be troubled, and keep his vows.

 presents his peace terms to his envoy Ser 
Cleos Frey
. Afterward,
Catelyn argues with Robb over his refusal to exchange 
Jaime Lannister
 and his plan to send 
Theon Greyjoy
 back to
the 
Iron Islands
. Later, Catelyn discusses the war with 
Brynden Tully
 and they plan an alliance with King 
Renly
Baratheon
.
Synopsis
As they wait in 
Riverrun
's Great Hall, 
Catelyn
 watches her son 
Robb
 restlessly adjust his new-forged crown several
times, and remarks to herself that a crown is not easy to wear, especially for a boy of fifteen years.
The ancient crown of the 
Kings of Winter
 was lost three centuries ago when 
Torrhen Stark
 submitted to 
Aegon the
Conqueror
, but the smiths have done well to match the descriptions: an open circlet of hammered bronze
surmounted by nine black iron spikes in the shape of longswords. There is no gold, or silver, or gems; bronze and
iron are the metals of winter, dark and strong.
As the guards bring in the captive, Robb lays his sword across his knees in the customary gesture of hostility. As Ser
Cleos Frey
 is forced to his knees, Catelyn reflects that he does not look like a 
Lannister
. Although his mother Lady
Genna
 is sister to Lord 
Tywin Lannister
, Ser Cleos has inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of
his father, Ser 
Emmon Frey
.
Robb's sword glimmers faintly as he bids Ser Cleos to rise, but it is 
Grey Wind
 who frightens the knight. As big as
any elkhound, Robb's 
direwolf
 sniffs at Ser Cleos, who was captured in the 
Whispering Wood
 where Grey Wind
killed half a dozen men. Ser Cleos scrambles to his feet and away from the direwolf so quickly that it provokes
laughter from the audience. Ser Cleos thanks Robb, calling him “my lord,” but 
Greatjon Umber
 corrects that a king
is styled “Your Grace.” Ser Cleos accepts the correction, and Catelyn notes that he truly is more 
Frey
 than Lannister;
they would never have gotten such an honorific out of 
Jaime Lannister
.
Robb wishes Ser Cleos to be his envoy to Queen 
Cersei
 in 
King's Landing
. Robb reminds Ser Cleos that he
considers him a Lannister, not a Frey, since he sided with the Lannisters in the Whispering Wood. He therefore
expects Ser Cleos to return with the queen's reply and resume his captivity. Ser Cleos vows on his 
knighthood
 to do
so, and asks what the message is. Robb offers to make peace if his if his terms are met. At the back of the hall, Lord
Rickard Karstark
 shoves through a rank of guards and out the door, but Robb pays no attention. Exchanging his
sword for a parchment, Robb reads his terms:
First, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King's Landing to 
White
Harbor
. It is to be understood that 
Sansa
's betrothal to 
Joffrey Baratheon
 is at an end. When I receive word
from my 
castellan
 that my sisters have returned unharmed to 
Winterfell
, I will release the queen's cousins, the
squire 
Willem Lannister
 and your brother 
Tion Frey
, and give them safe escort to 
Casterly Rock
 or
wheresoever she desires them delivered.
Secondly, my 
lord father
's bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his 
brother
 and 
sister
 in the crypts

beneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his
service at King's Landing must also be returned.
Third, my father's greatsword 
Ice
 will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun.
Fourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine
that he took captive in the 
battle on the Green Fork
 of the 
Trident
. Once he does so, I shall release my own
captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the 
Battle of the Camps
, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will
remain my hostage for his father's good behavior.
Lastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over 
the north
. Henceforth we
are no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain shall include all the 
Stark
lands north of 
the Neck
, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded
by the 
Golden Tooth
 to the west and the 
Mountains of the Moon
 in the east.
After a cheer from the Greatjon, Robb states he will provide a map of the new borders. He declares that Lord Tywin
must cease his raids and withdraw, King Joffrey must rescind all claims to Robb's lands and subjects, and the
Lannisters must deliver ten highborn hostages as a pledge of peace. Robb promises to release two hostages every
year so long as the pact is honored, but if it is not he will give Queen Cersei another Whispering Wood. To
emphasize his point, Robb whistles and Grey Wind comes forward and snarls. The Greatjon raises another cheer and
Grey Wind howls. When Ser Cleos agrees, Robb orders him to depart with Ser 
Robin Ryger
 at first light and
dismisses the assembly.
Out in the gallery, Catelyn compliments her son's performance, but notes that the theatrics with Grey Wind befit a
boy more than a king. Robb only smiles and asks if she saw Ser Cleos' face. Catelyn replies that what she saw was
Rickard Karstark storming out. Robb admits he saw it as well. Catelyn's brother 
Edmure Tully
 comments that others
may agree with Lord Rickard, and asks how they can talk of peace while the Lannisters are still pillaging the
Riverlands
. He urges Robb to march on Lord Tywin at 
Harrenhal
, but Robb insists he does not have the strength.
Edmure points out that they only grow weaker sitting here.
Catelyn snaps that it was Edmure's idea to permit the river lords to depart for their own lands. Edmure argues that he
cannot command his lords to remain idle while their crops are burnt and their people killed, but it would be an ill
thing if a northman like Lord Rickard left them. Robb agrees to speak with Lord Rickard, but he cannot blame the
man for loathing peace with 
his
 
sons
' killers. Catelyn points out that more bloodshed will not bring back the dead.
She suggests a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms, but Robb declares that sweeter terms would have
gagged him. Catelyn realizes that her son wants vengeance as much as Lord Rickard.
Catelyn points out that Cersei will never trade Sansa and 
Arya
 for a pair of cousins when what she wants is her
brother Jaime. Robb explains that his bannermen will never allow him to release the Kingslayer, even if he wanted
to. Catelyn says the lords made Robb their king, but Robb replies that they can unmake him just as easy. Catelyn
argues that the safe return of the girls is worth Robb's crown, fearing for her daughters if something bad should
befall Jaime in their custody. Robb assures her that no one sees Jaime without his warrant.
Catelyn asks if Robb is afraid to face Jaime in the field again. Edmure sides with Robb, but accidentally refers to
him as "the boy." Robb roars at Edmure not to call him a boy and declares he can defeat Jaime again if he must. He
admits he would have traded Jaime for his father, but looks hurt when Catelyn presses him to say whether the girls
are important enough. Catelyn realizes that Robb is doing his best, yet she cannot bear the thought of losing her
daughters as well as her husband. Robb promises that if Cersei refuses peace he will do all he can for his sisters by
making her rue the decision.
Catelyn can sense Robb is tired of the subject. He asks her to go to 
the Twins
 to meet Lord 
Walder Frey
's daughters
and help choose his future bride. Catelyn sees this as an excuse to send her away for saying things Robb does not
want to hear, so she tells Robb he is old enough to choose for himself. Next, Robb urges her to accompany 
Theon
Greyjoy
 and the 
Mallisters
 to 
Seagard
, and return by ship to Winterfell to be with 
Bran
 and 
Rickon
. Catelyn insists
that until her father dies her place is at Riverrun.
Robb mentions that he could command her to go, but Catelyn counters by asking Robb to reconsider sending Theon

as his envoy to 
Pyke
. Robb asks who would be better to negotiate with Lord 
Balon Greyjoy
 than his son. Catelyn
insists that 
anyone
 would be better. Robb argues that Theon fought bravely for them and they have need of his
father's longships. Catelyn replies that they will get the ships sooner if Theon remains a hostage. She also insists
Balon is not trustworthy and may aspire to wear a crown 
again
 himself. Robb declares he will gladly give Balon a
crown if it helps defeat the Lannisters. Before Catelyn can reply, Robb walks off and Catelyn can only watch him
go, remembering back at 
Moat Cailin
 when she urged him to command as he does now.
Catelyn asks Edmure to join her in father's sickroom, but he begs off to speak with some new recruits. On her way to
the central keep, Catelyn shortcuts through the 
godswood
, where the leaves still rustle on the trees, ignorant of the
white raven
 that has proclaimed the arrival of autumn. Catelyn is thankful that the weather is holding, since autumn
is a fearful time when even the wisest never know if the next harvest will be the last.
She finds Lord 
Hoster Tully
 sleeping in his solar, made frail by the death growing within him. Beside the bed sits
her uncle, Ser 
Bynden the Blackfish
. When Catelyn asks if Robb knows of his return, the Blackfish says he did not
interrupt the court because Robb will want to hear his news in private first. When her uncle asks about her father,
Catelyn confesses that he grows weaker every day, and sometimes his mind is unclear. The Blackfish admits that he
always wonders if his brother will be dead upon his return. Catelyn comforts him that at least he made his peace
with her father.
They sit silently for a long time before Catelyn asks for the Blackfish's tidings. To avoid waking her father, they
adjourn to the balcony. Her uncle comments that the 
red comet
 is now visible by day, and says his men call it the
“Red Messenger,” though he wonders what the message is. Catelyn says the Greatjon claims it is a red flag of
vengeance for her husband, while Edmure claims it is a victory omen: a fish in 
Tully
 colors, red against blue.
Catelyn only sees the crimson of House Lannister, but her uncle points out that the comet is neither Lannister
crimson nor Tully red, but a smear of blood across the sky. Catelyn asks whose blood, but the Blackfish asks if there
was ever a war where only one side bled.
The Blackfish explains that the war has spread south to the 
Blackwater Rush
 and north nearly to the Twins. 
Marq
Piper
 and 
Karyl Vance
 have won small victories, and 
Beric Dondarrion
 is harassing Lord Tywin's raiders and
foragers. Ser 
Burton Crakehall
 boasted of killing Dondarrion until Dondarrion killed him in an ambush. Catelyn
remembers that some of her husband's household guard rode with Dondarrion from King's Landing and blesses their
actions.
The Blackfish comments that Dondarrion and 
Thoros of Myr
 are clever enough to play hit and run, but Robb should
never have permitted the river lords return to their own lands. 
Jonos Bracken
 was wounded and lost his heir 
Hendry
reclaiming 
Stone Hedge
, 
Tytos Blackwood
 is left with only 
Raventree Hall
, and young 
Lyman Darry
 was killed by
Gregor Clegane
 less than a fortnight after reclaiming 
Castle Darry
. The Blackfish declares that Clegane's head
would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm.
Talk of heads reminds Catelyn that her husband's remains mounted on spike above the 
Red Keep
. She reminds her
uncle that Gregor Clegane is only a servant of Lord Tywin, whom Catelyn believes is the true danger. The Blackfish
agrees, noting Tywin's wisdom in sitting safe in Harrenhal and living off their harvests and burning what he does not
take. In addition to Clegane, Ser 
Amory Lorch
 and a 
Qohorik
 
sellsword
 are also abroad, raping, burning, and
butchering. Catelyn knows Edmure will rage at the news. She also admits Robb is restless and may listen if Edmure
and the Greatjon will urge him to march on Harrenhal. The Blackfish declares that is exactly what Lord Tywin
wishes, and the first rule of war is to never give the enemy his wish.
Catelyn recalls the tales of the vast fortress of Harrenhal by the waters of the 
Gods Eye
. King 
Harren the Black
beggared the Riverlands and the 
Iron Islands
 alike to realize his dream of the highest hall and tallest towers in
Westeros
, but thick walls and high towers proved small use against Aegon the Conqueror's 
dragons
. Harren and all
his line perished in the fires that engulfed the fortress. Strong the castle might be, but also cursed, for every House
that has held Harrenhal since has come to misfortune.
Catelyn decides they must dissuade Robb from fighting at Harrenhal. Her uncle then tells her the worst part: Ser
Stafford Lannister
 is gathering a new host at Casterly Rock, though it will be made of sellswords and new recruits
who require training. However, Lord Tywin is in no hurry and will wait patiently for his reinforcements. Then
Catelyn gets an idea: if they confront Lord Tywin with a new threat he might be forced leave Harrenhal. Her uncle

names Lord Renly, but Catelyn insist that they must call him 
King
 Renly if they are to ask his help. The Blackfish
smiles, but points out that Renly will want something in return. Catelyn replies that he will want what kings always
want: homage.

Tyrion III
Tyrion
 dines with Lord 
Janos Slynt
. They discuss the murder of King 
Robert
’s 
bastard daughter
, 
Eddard Stark
’s
execution, and candidates for Commander of the 
City Watch
. Tyrion then has Slynt taken into custody to join the
Night's Watch
. Afterward, he discusses the same topics with 
Varys
.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 offers more wine to his dinner guest, Lord 
Janos Slynt
. The butcher’s son accepts and asks if the wine is
from the 
Arbor
. Tyrion replies that the wine is actually an uncommonly rich 
Dornish
 vintage. Slynt compliments
Tyrion’s gift for words, calling him a lord, but Tyrion points out that Slynt is the true lord and a simple “Tyrion”
will suffice. He notes that Slynt does not sip his wine and is so drunk he dribbles onto his fine clothes. Unlike Slynt,
Tyrion has gone easy on the wine but certainly not the food, since one of his first acts as 
Hand
 was to hire the finest
cook in the city. Slynt is very impressed with the food and says perhaps he will hire Tyrion’s cook to serve him at
Harrenhal
. Tyrion quips that wars have been fought over less.
Tyrion declares Slynt a bold man to take a grim and allegedly cursed place like Harrenhal as his seat. Slynt
dismisses the superstition and insists it takes a bold man to rise as he and Tyrion have. Tyrion refills Slynt’s cup as
he asks about Slynt’s list of proposed successors as Commander of the 
City Watch
. Slynt opines that he would
choose 
Allar Deem
, whom he describes as a good and loyal man. Tyrion says he is considering Ser 
Jacelyn Bywater
,
a distinguished knight whose name does not appear on Slynt’s list. Slynt argues that Bywater is rigid and thinks
overmuch of himself and his honor, insisting that Allar Deem is the one Tyrion wants. Tyrion remarks that Allar
Deem is little loved in the streets, but Slynt insists he is feared, which is better. Tyrion brings up that Deem killed a
young whore and her 
infant daughter
. Slynt explains that only the child was supposed to die, but the mother got in
the way. He says he chose Deem because Deem is a hard man who always follows orders and never speaks of it
afterward. Tyrion asks who ordered Slynt to kill the whore’s bastard, but Slynt insists he prides himself on being as
tight-lipped as Allar Deem.
Tyrion suggests that 
Jeor Mormont
, 
Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch
, could use men like Slynt and Deem,
but Slynt responds that there is small chance of that. Tyrion points out that life takes queer turns, as it did with
Eddard Stark
, who never imagined he would die on the steps of 
Baelor’s Sept
. Slynt laughs that few did and
confirms that even 
Varys
 was surprised. Slynt also confirms the execution was King 
Joffrey
’s decision, and seems
confused when Tyrion points out 
Cersei
 planned to allow Stark to take the black.
Tyrion comments on Slynt’s new bloody spear sigil, and asks if Slynt drove the spear into Eddard Stark’s back
himself or if he only gave the command. Angered, Slynt insists Stark was a traitor who tried to buy him. Tyrion
replies, “Little dreaming that you had already been sold.” Slynt declares he will not have his honor questioned, but
Tyrion retorts that Slynt has no honor, though he does admit a spear thrust in the back is a good bargain for a
lordship and a castle. Slynt rises and demands what right Tyrion has to chastise him. Tyrion points out that Slynt
knows exactly who he is and should thank the gods he does not have to deal with Lord 
Tywin
 instead.
Tyrion declares Slynt’s two 
younger
 
sons
 will become squires and the 
eldest
 will inherit his title and sufficient
lands, but not Harrenhal. Then Tyrion explains that the carrack 
Summer's Dream
 will take Slynt to 
the Wall
, where
he is to join the 
Night's Watch
 and give Tyrion’s regards to Lord Commander Mormont. Enraged, Slynt declares he

has powerful friends like King Joffrey, 
Littlefinger
, and Queen Cersei; perhaps Tyrion will be the one banished to
the Wall
.
As Slynt throws open the door to leave, he comes face to face with Ser Jacelyn Bywater, whom Tyrion introduces as
the new commander of the City Watch. As six gold cloaks usher Slynt away, Tyrion hands Slynt’s list of successors
to Bywater and asks him to see they accompany Slynt to 
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
, adding that it would not be taken
amiss if Allar Deem was swept overboard.
Soon after, Varys glides into the hall to praise Tyrion’s actions. Tyrion comments that he is tempted to do Varys the
same as Deem. Varys replies that Tyrion might be disappointed: the storms come and go, but he keeps on paddling.
Tyrion accuses the eunuch of concealing that Cersei sent gold cloaks to kill King 
Robert
’s bastards. Varys asks
forgiveness, but Tyrion refuses, angry that he must make a show of punishing the likes of Slynt and Deem while his
sister continues on her savage course.
Tyrion insists Varys tell him everything he knows from now on, but Varys only says he knows quite a lot. Tyrion
points out Varys did not know enough to save the whore and her child. Varys says he took steps to save another
bastard, an 
older boy
, but assures Tyrion he never dreamed the baseborn daughter of a whore would be considered a
threat. Tyrion remarks that being Robert’s was enough of a threat for Cersei. Varys blames himself, and comments
that the whore loved King Robert. Thinking of 
Shae
 and 
Tysha
, Tyrion wonders if a whore can truly love anyone.
He recalls that, although he provided her with a rich manse and fine gifts, when he said Shae served him best
between the sheets it was not what she wanted to hear.
Tyrion remarks that it seems Joffrey is truly to blame for Eddard Stark’s death, though Slynt and Ser 
Ilyn Payne
carried out the sentence almost as if they expected it. Varys states that Tyrion can prevent further follies with the
support of the gold cloaks, but there are still Cersei’s household red cloaks to consider. Tyrion responds that they are
loyal to 
Casterly Rock
 and outnumbered by his 
Vale mountain clansmen
, not to mention six thousand gold cloaks if
Bywater is the man Varys claims.
Tyrion does not trust Varys, but cannot deny his usefulness. He asks Varys why he is so helpful and Varys replies,
“You are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you.” Tyrion asks, “As you served 
Jon Arryn
 and Eddard
Stark?” but Varys states he served as best he could, and he does not think Tyrion will share the same fate, since
power is a curious thing. Varys brings up the riddle he asked Tyrion 
before
. Tyrion says the answer depends on the
sellsword
, who holds the power of life and death. Varys wonders aloud why men pretend kings hold power if this is
true. Tyrion points out that kings can call other swordsmen, but Varys only asks why these other swordsmen obey
rather than rule. Neither the godly 
High Septon
, nor the lawful Queen Regent, nor the ever-knowledgeable Varys
could prevent Eddard Stark’s death, so who truly killed him: Joffrey who gave the command, Ser Ilyn who swung
the sword, or another? When Tyrion asks for the answer to the riddle, Varys declares that power resides where men
believe it resides. Tyrion asks if power is just a trick, and Varys agrees it is a shadow on the wall, though shadows
can kill and often a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
Tyrion smiles and declares he is growing fond of Varys, and though he may kill him yet he thinks he will feel sad
about it. Varys declares he will take that as high praise. Tyrion asks what Varys is, but Varys only says he is a loyal
servant of the realm. Tyrion presses on to ask who made Varys a eunuch and who he 
truly
 is. Varys’ smile never
flickers, but his eyes show a very different emotion as he insists his tale is long and sad.
Varys draws a parchment from his sleeve and reveals the master of the galley 
White Hart
 plans to defect to Lord
Stannis
. Tyrion sighs that they should make an example of the man, which will serve both to discourage other
captains and to keep Joffrey busy. Next, Varys informs him Ser 
Horas
 and Ser 
Hobber Redwyne
 have bribed a guard
and plan to escape on the 
Pentoshi
 galley 
Moonrunner
. Tyrion instructs Varys to have Bywater send the guard to the
Night’s Watch and post a guard on the 
Moonrunner
 just in case. Next, Varys notes that the clansman 
Timett
 killed a
man for cheating at tiles. When Varys confirms the man 
was
 cheating, Tyrion declares Timett did all honest men a
favor. Next, Varys explains that the 
red comet
 has brought all manner of prophets to the city to preach doom and
destruction. Tyrion instructs Varys to let them rant. Finally, Varys states that when Lord 
Gyles Rosby
 proposed a
toast to the king, Ser 
Balon Swann
 remarked they would need three cups for that and many laughed. Tyrion insists
he is not interested in treasonous table talk, which Varys calls wise.
Tyrion returns to his solar to find 
Bronn
 waiting. The sellsword asks about Slynt, and Tyrion admits he has likely

replaced one of Littlefinger’s men with one of Varys’. Tyrion asks how the recruiting is going, and Bronn explains
that he only hires the sellswords who make a good impression in a duel. Tyrion asks if Bronn has killed any
candidates, and Bronn answers, “No one we could have used.” Tyrion asks what should happen if one of them kills
Bronn, but Bronn only says that man will be one Tyrion wants to hire. Tyrion asks Bronn if he would kill an infant
girl without question when commanded. Bronn replies, “Without question? No. I’d ask how much.” Tyrion remarks
to himself that he does not need Slynt or Deem, since he has a hundred such men of his own. He wants to laugh or
cry, but most of all he wants Shae.

Arya IV
Arya
 and the others have abandoned the 
kingsroad
 to avoid the 
gold cloaks
. As they travel west they come upon a
burned village. When Arya goes to make water in the forest, she runs into a wolf pack, which scares her. She reports
this to 
Yoren
, who laments they should have taken a ship instead.
Synopsis
The road 
Arya
 and the other travel is now little more than two ruts through the weeds and the human flood has
slowed to a trickle, so there is no one to say which way they go. However, the road wanders back and forth, tangles
with other trails, and sometimes vanishes entirely. Arya hates it. The terrain is gentle enough, but even so the path is
narrow enough that the wagons slow their pace to a crawl. A dozen times a day they must stop to free a wheel or
double up the teams to climb a muddy slope.
Arya constantly looks over her shoulder, wondering when the 
gold cloaks
 will catch them. She does not trust their
sentries, especially the orphan boys, who seem lost out in the woods. Arya can sneak past any of them when she
goes off in the night to make water alone. Once she snuck right up to 
Lommy Greenhands
 and considered jumping
on him, but changed her mind at the thought of 
Yoren
 punishing her again.
The orphans all treat 
Gendry
 like someone special because the queen wants his head. Gendry will have none of it,
though. He insists he was only an apprentice armorer until Master 
Tobho Mott
 told him he was to join the 
Night's
Watch
. Then he goes off to polish his bull helm, but never wears it. Lommy guesses Gendry is the "
wolf lord
's"
bastard, which angers Arya, who knows 
Jon Snow
 is her father's only bastard. She wishes she could ride home
alone, but she knows that would mean no one to scout ahead, watch behind, stand guard while she sleeps, and help
her fight off the gold cloaks.
Yoren decides the 
kingsroad
 will not be safe until they cross the 
Trident
, so they intend to travel around the west
(far) side of 
Gods Eye
. Settlements and farmland gives way to forest and the terrain grows rougher. Their provisions
soon run out, so Yoren turns to the poachers 
Koss
 and 
Kurz
 to range ahead to hunt, and the younger boys are set to
pick berries and plunder orchards along the road. Arya is a skilled climber and a fast picker, and one day she comes
across a rabbit, which Yoren stews. Everyone else gets a spoonful, but Arya gets a whole leg and shares it with
Gendry.
At 
Briarwhite
, some fieldhands force them to pay for the sweetcorn they have taken. Yoren gives them some
coppers, but complains that brothers of the Night's Watch used to be feasted throughout the realm, even by high
lords. That night, Yoren is too angry to eat and only paces around the camp, muttering to himself. After that they
find men guarding the fields more and more.
The next day, Koss reports a camp of twenty or thirty men in mail and halfhelms armed with spears. Some of the
men are wounded or dying and they have only one horse, which is lame. The soldiers carry a banner of a 
spotted
treecat
, which Yoren cannot identify. They go wide around the camp, since the men might be desperate enough to
take their horses or worse. The detour costs them two days at least, but Yoren insists they will spend the rest of their
lives at 
the Wall
, so there is no rush to get there.

One evening, 
Dobber
 spies a fire on the northern horizon. As night falls the fire seems to grow brighter until it looks
as if the whole north is ablaze. From time to time they can smell the smoke, but the wind holds steady and the
flames never get any closer. By morning the fire has burned out, but no one has slept very well.
It is midday when they come upon the remains of a village. The fields are scorched for miles around and there are
burnt bodies everywhere. Leaving the rest to guard the wagons, Yoren takes 
Murch
 and 
Cutjack
 to investigate the
ruined holdfast. When Arya turns to Gendry he has his helmet on. After a long time, Yoren returns with a 
little girl
and a woman whose right forearm is missing. The girl only cries and the woman only whimpers, "Please," over and
over again. 
Rorge
 thinks this is funny and he and 
Biter
 laugh until Murch curses them and tells them to shut up.
They fix the woman a place in a wagon. 
Hot Pie
 murmurs that he is scared and Arya admits she is too. Hot Pie
admits he never actually kicked a boy to death, he just sold his mother's pies. Arya rides as far ahead of the wagons
as she dares to get away from the little girl crying and the woman whispering. The one-armed woman dies at
evenfall, and Gendry and Cutjack bury her on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blows, Arya
thinks she can hear the tree's branches whispering, "Please," over and over, which frightens her badly.
That night, Yoren orders no fire, so supper is sparse and Arya fills her belly with water instead. When she wakes it is
pitch-black and her bladder is full to bursting. As she is leaving to make water, Hot Pie is on guard and insists Yoren
ordered everyone to stay close. When Arya explains her need, Hot Pie tells her to use a nearby tree and explains that
he heard wolves earlier. Rather than fight with him, Arya acts afraid and pretends to go back to sleep until Hot Pie
leaves, then sneaks into the woods on the other side of the camp. Just to make sure, she goes out twice as far as
usual. As she is doing her business, Arya hears a rustling and sees the eyes shining out from the wood. She grabs for
Needle
 and counts the eyes of a whole pack. One wolf comes forward and bares his teeth, but then retreats into the
darkness and the wolves leave.
She follows the sound of Yoren sharpening his knife back to camp. She climbs into the back of a wagon with him
and tells him there are wolves in the woods. Yoren is unperturbed, and comments that he thought Arya's 
kind
 were
fond of wolves. Arya tells him about her 
direwolf
 
Nymeria
 and how she was forced to drive her off. Yoren
comments that the only wolves they have to fear are the human kind, like the ones who burned that village. He
wonders aloud if he should have left them all back in the city where it seems safer. Arya insists that she wants to go
home. Yoren replies that he has been bringing men to the Wall for nearly thirty years and only lost three, but this
time he should have taken a ship.
Yoren tells Arya to get some sleep, and she tries, but she can hear the wolves howling, and fainter than that she
hears what might be screams.

Davos Seaworth
 watches the burning of the 
Seven

Stannis Baratheon
 draws out the sword
Lightbringer
 and 
Melisandre
 proclaims him 
Azor Ahai
 reborn. Later, Davos hears new of the war from the pirate
Salladhor Saan
, who insists Stannis' new sword is not the true Lightbringer. That night, Davos and Stannis discuss
his plan to claim the 
Iron Throne
. When Davos asks why he supports Melisandre's 
foreign god
, Stannis explains that
he means to discover Melisandre's true power.
Synopsis
Davos Seaworth
 is among the hundreds watching the statues of the 
Seven
 burn outside the gates of 
Dragonstone
. His
sons 
Allard
 and 
Dale
 agree that it is an ill thing to burn the gods, but Davos cautions them that this is not the place.
The red priestess 
Melisandre
 walks around the fire, praying in three tongues for 
R'hllor
, the Lord of Light, to accept
these false gods of the enemy and cast light upon them. The prayer ends with the sacred refrain, "For the night is
dark and full of terrors." Queen 
Selyse
 echoes the words, but King

 only watches impassively.

conquest
, but that did
not save it from the queen's men. They overturned the altars, pulled down the statues, and smashed the stained glass.
Davos recalls that the statues were originally carved from the masts of the ships that carried the first 
Targaryens
from 
Valyria
. 
Septon
 
Barre
 could only curse them, but Ser 
Hubard Rambton
 and his three sons slew four men before
they were overwhelmed. Afterward, pious Lord 
Guncer Sunglass
 withdrew his support for Stannis and was
imprisoned along with the septon and Ser Hubard's two surviving sons.
Though he has never been devout, the burning gods make Davos feel ill. Lord 
Ardrian Celtigar
 coughs from the
smoke and Lord 
Duram Bar Emmon
 turns grey, but Lord 
Monford Velaryon
 watches Stannis rather than the fire.
Davos wonders what Velaryon is thinking, but knows such a proud lord will never confide in him. The lords all
scorn Davos and his sons, but one day their grandsons will joust together. In time Davos imagines his sigil will fly
as high as theirs, but only if Stannis wins his throne, since everything Davos is he owes to Stannis. It was Stannis
who gave Davos his knighthood and his war galley 
Black Betha
. His sons Dale and Allard captain ships of their
own, 
Maric
 is oarmaster on the 
Fury
, 
Matthos
 serves as Davos' mate, 
Devan
 is a royal squire who will one day be a
knight, and his two 
youngest
 
sons
 will one day be knights as well. His wife 
Marya
 is mistress of a small keep, and
Davos can hunt deer in his own woods. All this he has of Stannis for the price of a few finger joints, taken as just
punishment for flaunting the law all his life. As he thinks back, Davos touches the pouch around his neck where he
keeps his finger bones for luck; they will all need luck soon.
Melisandre recounts an ancient prophecy that at the end of a long summer, when the stars bleed and darkness falls
over world, 
Azor Ahai
 will be reborn and draw the burning sword 
Lightbringer
 from the fire and destroy the
darkness. Then she calls upon Azor Ahai to claim his sword and Stannis marches forward. His squires, Devan
Seaworth and 
Bryen Farring
, equip him with a padded glove and leather cape. Using the cape to ward off the flames,
Stannis plunges into the fire and draws out a near-molten sword from the statue of the 
Mother
. Queen Selyse and her
queen's men chant praises, and Melisandre names the sword Lightbringer and declares Stannis Azor Ahai come
again. The cherry-red sword is burning his glove, so Stannis thrusts it into the dirt.
Melisandre calls upon R'hllor to cast light upon them, and Selyse and the queen's men reply that the night is dark
and full of terrors. Then Melisandre sings a song in the 
Asshai
'i language until only charwood remains of the gods.
Impatient, Stannis escorts his queen back into Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer in the dirt for his squires to collect.

Davos notes that the burnt and blackened Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess. A few lords linger, speaking
quietly, but they fall silent when they see Davos looking at them. Davos knows that these lords will pull him down if
Stannis should fall, but neither will he court the favor of Queen Selyse by giving himself to this new Lord of Light.
When the fire starts to dwindle, Melisandre and the squires depart with the sword, and Davos and his sons join the
crowd headed for the harbor. Davos comments that Devan did well as the king's squire. Allard asks why the king's
squires wore 
fiery heart
 sigils in place of the 
crowned stag
. Davos points out that a lord can choose more than one
badge. Allard insists that it was an ill thing to burn the Seven. Davos asks when Allard grew so devout and what a
smuggler's son would know of the gods' doings. Allard insists he is a knight's son and asks why the lords should
remember Davos is a knight if he does not himself. Davos points out that Allard will never be a knight if he meddles
in affairs that do not concern him; it is not for them to question their rightful king. His sons do not like to recall they
were lowborn, and when they look at 
House Seaworth
's sigil they see only the black ship and close their eyes to the
onion.
In the extremely crowded port, Davos enters an inn, where he finds the flamboyant 
Lysene
 pirate 
Salladhor Saan
eating grapes. A friend and business partner from his smuggling days, it was Davos who recruited Saan to Stannis'
cause. When Davos asks why he did not attend the burning, Salladhor explains that such sights are common in Lys.
They bore him, and hopefully they will soon bore Stannis.
Salladhor explains that one of his 
trading ships
 arrived from 
King's Landing
 with news that 
Tyrion Lannister
 is now
overseeing the capital and has driven out 
Janos Slynt
 as commander of the 
City Watch
. Davos asks how well the city
is defended. Saan replies that the walls are strong, but defended only by the gold cloaks, who are too few and
inexperienced. He urges a swift strike to take the city, and then Tyrion could be dressed as a fool and Queen 
Cersei
could warm his bed for a night as part of his payment. Davos assures Salladhor he will be paid, but the pirate insists
he wants gold, not words. Davos promises there is gold in the treasury at King's Landing, and Stannis is the most
honorable man in the 
Seven Kingdoms
.
Salladhor again urges an attack on the capital, but Davos asks how long they could hold it with 
Tywin Lannister
 and
Renly Baratheon
 against them. Saan reveals Renly has left 
Highgarden
 with his army and his 
new queen
 to march
on King's Landing. That Renly brought his bride along surprises Davos; it suggests either great love or great
confidence. Davos declares that Stannis must be told, but Salladhor has already done so, though Stannis seems to
disapprove of the pirate.
Abruptly, Salladhor claims Stannis' sword is not the true Lightbringer and asks how a burnt sword will serve
Stannis. Davos corrects that it is a 
burning
 sword, but Saan insists it is burnt. He recounts the legend of how, after
two failed attempts, Azor Ahai labored a hundred days and nights on a hero's blade to oppose darkness. Then he
tempered the sword in his wife 
Nissa Nissa
's heart and her blood, soul, courage, and strength went into the steel to
create Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes. Salladhor tells Davos to be thankful the sword Stannis raised is not
real because, "Too much light can hurt the eyes, and fire burns."
Salladhor asks when Stannis will sail, and Davos replies that it depends on the will of the king's new god. Salladhor
asks who Davos' god is. Cautious of his surroundings, Davos replies that his god is King Stannis, who made him and
blessed him with trust. Salladhor says he will remember and excuses himself, declaring they will soon feast in the
Red Keep. He also asks Davos to remind Stannis he will owe another 30,000 dragons come the black of the moon,
commenting that the statues they burnt might have brought a noble price. He jokes that if Stannis grants him Queen
Cersei for a night he shall forgive him.
Davos lingers in the inn, thinking of Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword, though there was no true magic in that
sword. A true sword of fire would be a wonder, but when he thinks of Nissa Nissa it is his own wife Marya he
pictures, and he decides the price is more than he cares to pay.
After dark, Devan arrives with a summons from King Stannis. When Davos arrives, the important bannermen are
leaving. Ser 
Axell Florent
, the foremost of the queen's men, asks what Davos thought of the burning gods and
explains he saw a vision of the glory awaiting Stannis when they take King's Landing. Davos replies that all he saw
was fire and pushes past, wondering why Ser Axell bothered, since Davos is the king's man as much as Axell is the
queen's.

Davos finds Stannis seated at the Painted Table with 
Maester
 
Pylos
. Stannis commands Davos to have a look at his
letter. Davos obediently selects a paper before pointing out that he is illiterate. Mildly irritated, Stannis commands
Maester Pylos to read the letter instead:
All men know me for the trueborn son of 
Steffon Baratheon
, Lord of Storm’s End, by his lady wife 
Cassana
 of
House Estermont
. I declare upon the honor of my House that my beloved brother 
Robert
, our late king, left no
trueborn issue of his body, the boy 
Joffrey
, the boy 
Tommen
, and the girl 
Myrcella
 being abominations born of
incest between 
Cersei Lannister
 and her brother 
Jaime
 the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day
lay claim to the 
Iron Throne
 of the Seven Kingdoms of 
Westeros
. Let all true men declare their loyalty. Done in
the Light of the Lord, under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the
Andals, the 
Rhoynar
, and the 
First Men
, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
Stannis orders Pylos to add "Ser" to Jaime's name since he is still a knight, and to remove "beloved brother" since it
is a lie. Then he declares all of their 117 ravens will be used to carry copies across the realm, though most will likely
be burnt by lords who support the other kings even though Stannis is their rightful king. Therefore, Stannis orders
Davos to sail north as far as 
White Harbor
 while his son Dale sails south as far as 
the Arbor
. They are to post the
declaration in every port and fishing village they pass for every man who can to read. Davos points out that few
smallfolk can read and requests knights to read the declarations aloud. Stannis agrees, since he has a hundred
knights who would rather read than fight. He plans to send Allard across the 
narrow sea
 to carry the declaration to
the 
Free Cities
 as well, so that all the world will know of his claim and Cersei's infamy.
After Stannis dismisses Pylos, Davos asks what the lords thought of the letter. Stannis snorts that they all flattered
him except Velaryon, who said steel would decide the matter as if Stannis never suspected as much. Stannis curses
his lords and asks Davos for the truth. Davos declares the words blunt and strong, but reminds Stannis they still have
no firm proof of incest. Stannis replies there is proof of a sort at 
Storm's End
: 
Robert
's acknowledged bastard 
Edric
Storm
 is the very image of Robert, yet his supposed sons 
Joffrey
 and 
Tommen
 look nothing like him. Davos reminds
Stannis that they cannot reach Edric at Storm's End.
Davos also suggests removing the reference to the Lord of Light from the letter in favor of a something less specific.
When Stannis asks if he has become devout, Davos says he does not know this new god but knew the ones they
burned. Stannis argues that it was only wood they burned, but Davos mentions that charitable septons would feed
him when he was a begging boy. Davos explains that the people will not love Stannis if he takes away their familiar
gods and gives them a foreign one. Stannis replies that the people have never loved him.
Gazing out the window, Stannis declares he stopped believing in gods the day he saw the 
Windproud
 break up on
Shipbreaker Bay
, refusing to worship any gods monstrous enough to drown his parents. The 
High Septon
 always
prattles about justice and goodness flowing from the gods, but Stannis insists all he ever saw of either was made by
men. Davos asks why Stannis would trouble with a new god if he does not believe. Stannis answers that, god or no
god, Melisandre has power. Davos replies that Maester 
Cressen
 had wisdom, but Stannis argues that Cressen's wise
advice did no good: the 
storm lords
 laughed when he went begging. Stannis declares there will be no more begging
or laughing. The Iron Throne is rightfully his, but of the four kings he has the fewest men and the least gold. His
only assets are his ships and the red woman. Stannis asks if Davos knows that half his men are afraid to even speak
her name; a sorceress who can inspire such dread is not to be despised, and he means to find out if she can do more.
Stannis recalls that as a boy he nursed an injured goshawk named 
Proudwing
, who would follow him about and eat
from his hand but would not hunt. Finally, his great-uncle Ser 
Harbert
 told him, rightly, that he should try a different
bird because he was embarrassing himself. Stannis turns back to Davos and declares that the Seven have never
brought him so much as a sparrow. It is time he tried another hawk, a red hawk.

Theon II
After an absence of ten years, 
Theon Greyjoy
 arrives back home on the island 
Pyke
 aboard the 
Myraham
. He docks
at 
Lordsport
 and is disappointed to discover that his father, Lord 
Balon Greyjoy
, has send only Theon’s uncle 
Aeron
,
a priest of the 
Drowned God
, to escort him to 
Balon’s castle
. At Pyke, Theon is greeted coldly by his father, after
which he presents Balon with 
Robb Stark
’s letter. Balon rejects the proposed alliance with Robb, instead insisting
that he will 
pay the iron price
 and carve out a kingdom of his own.
Synopsis
Theon Greyjoy
 is aboard the 
Myraham
, which is taking him to 
his father's
 
castle
 on 
Pyke
. Although there is no safe
anchorage, Theon insists the 
Myraham
 pass by the castle so he can watch his home rise just as it dwindled when he
was taken away as a ward of 
Eddard Stark
 ten years before. Theon is unable to make out the banner above the 
Sea
Tower
, but he knows it is the golden kraken of 
House Greyjoy
. In the sky beyond the castle, the 
red comet
 is still
visible. Theon decides it is his comet, sliding a hand to the letter from 
Robb Stark
 that he considers as good as a
crown. The 
captain's daughter
 asks Theon if the castle is as he remembers it and he confesses it looks smaller. He
then gives the captain permission to make for port at 
Lordsport
 and takes the girl below deck, where he has her
satisfy him orally. The girl asks to come ashore with him, to be his 
salt wife
, but Theon rebuffs her, explaining that
the days of the 
Old Way
 are gone and that her place is on the 
Myraham
, despite her protests that her father will hit
her for having slept with Theon.
In the harbor of Lordsport, Theon notices at least fifty or sixty longships including those of Houses 
Goodbrother
,
Wynch
, and 
Harlaw
. Theon considers why his father has called the banners, wondering whether it is because of
caution, or whether Lord Balon had anticipated as to why Theon was finally coming home after all these years.
From aboard the ship, Theon discovers there is no honor guard to escort him to Pyke. As they make port the captain
of the Myraham announces him, but the waiting merchants are unimpressed and do not recognize him. He orders a
horse from an innkeeper, but their conversation is interrupted by a priest of the 
Drowned God
, who says he will
escort his nephew to Balon's castle. Theon does not recognize the grim, bearded priest until he remembers his father
writing that his uncle 
Aeron Greyjoy
 had gone down in a storm and turned holy after the near-death experience.
Theon finds that Aeron's cold manners are totally unlike the amiable man he remembers from his youth. Abruptly,
Aeron asks if Theon prays to the 
Stark
 
gods
 now, and Theon (who seldom prays at all) says no. Aeron commands
him to kneel in the mud and drenches his head with seawater from a waterskin, reconsecrating him to the Drowned
God.
Aeron informs Theon that his 
mother
 now lives on 
Harlaw
 because of her health and his sister 
Asha
 has taken her
ship, 
Black Wind
, to 
Great Wyk
 with messages from her father. Theon asks why his father has assembled his forces,
but Aeron insists Balon commanded secrecy. When Theon protests, stating he has a right to know as Balon's heir,
Aeron replies "
we shall see
" to that, stating that, although Balon has no other sons but Theon, he does have a
daughter. When Theon furiously replies that he will not allow himself to be cheated out of his birthright by a
woman, Aeron comments that Theon is a fool if he believes that Balon will ever hand over the 
Iron Islands
 to a
Stark, making Theon realize that, although he was never truly accepted by the Starks, he is now neither truly
accepted by his own family, either.
They reach Pyke at sunset, from where Aeron departs immediately. Theon is brought to his chambers by 
Helya
, who
informs him that Balon awaits him atop the Sea Tower. Theon dresses richly before leaving to meet his father. Balon
is smaller, gaunter, and greyer than Theon remembers him. Balon asks what Theon is now, and Theon replies he is a

man and Balon's heir. Balon only says they will see. Balon criticizes Theon's clothing and asks if the gold chain
around his neck was bought with iron or gold. Theon, recalling that the 
Old Way
 stipulates a warrior may only wear
jewelry taken from enemies he has slain, has to admit the chain was bought with 
gold
. Balon yanks the chain off
Theon's neck, declaring that 
his daughter
 has taken an axe for a lover and that he will not have his son dress like a
whore. Balon accuses Theon of having grown weak due to the green lands and decides the Starks have made Theon
theirs, calling Theon 
Robb Stark
's envoy. Theon claims the letter of Robb he carries was based on Theon's own
counsel, which amuses Balon. However, when Theon tells Balon that Robb looks upon him "as an older brother",
Balon grows angry.
Theon hands his father the letter, but it fails to impress Balon. In the letter, Robb offers Balon a crown in return for
having the ironborn attacking the 
westerlands
, specifically 
Lannisport
 and 
Casterly Rock
. Theon tells Balon the
proposed plan is his own and asks for his reward Casterly Rock as his own seat. Balon scoffs at the notion of
receiving such handsome reward for "a notion and a few lines of scribbling" and shows his dislike for the notion that
Robb will give him a crown, as "what is given can be taken away". Balon burns the letter and backhands Theon
when he protests. Balon declares that he will pay the iron price for his crown and take it by conquest as 
Urron
Redhand
 did five thousand years before. However, Balon feels Casterly Rock to be too strongly defended and Lord
Tywin Lannister
 to be too cunning by half. Theon asks what kingdom Balon means to carve out instead, but realizes
he already knows 
the answer
.

Daenerys Targaryen
 decides to follow the 
red comet
 deep into the 
red waste
 to protect her newborn 
dragons
. Many
of her 
khalasar
 die before they find shelter in a 
ruined city
. There, Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 tells her about his second
wife, 
Lynesse Hightower
. While her people rest, Daenerys sends her three 
bloodriders
 to scout, and 
Jhogo
 returns
with three strangers from the great city of 
Qarth
.
Synopsis
Daenerys Targaryen
 commands her small 
khalasar
 to follow the 
red comet
 the 
Dothraki
 have named 
shierak qiya
,
the Bleeding Star. The old men mutter that it is a bad omen, but it appeared the 
night
 they cremated her husband
Khal
 
Drogo
 and hatched her 
dragons
, so Daenerys considers it the herald of her coming. Her handmaid 
Doreah
explains that only the grim and terrible 
red lands
 lie in that direction, but Daenerys really has no choice. The other
khalasars
 hold sway to the north, the 
Lhazareen
 to the south, and Khal 
Pono
 is driving slaves west to 
Slaver's Bay
.
When Daenerys argues that Pono always spoke to her kindly, Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 reminds her that Pono was the first
to leave and will kill her now. She argues that she has dragons, but Jorah explains that the hatchlings would be easy
to kill, though Pono is more likely to seize them, since a living dragon is priceless. Daenerys makes it clear they are
hers and will never be taken while she lives, but Jorah insists she will not live long unless she goes where no one
else does. Mounted on her 
silver mare
 and garbed in her white 
hrakkar
 pelt to cover her bald head, Daenerys
commands her people to follow the comet and no words are raised against it; she is the Unburnt and Mother of
Dragons, so her word is their law.
They ride by night, leaving a trail of dead horses because Pono, 
Jhaqo
, and the others have taken the best mounts.
Her people are also the weak and unwanted, so Daenerys must project confidence and strength to encourage them.
Three days into the march, the weakest of her people start to die.
There is little forage and less water in the red waste. When supplies run low, they are forced to live on horseflesh
and the deaths increase. Daenerys suffers with her people; she sheds much weight and her milk dries up so she
cannot breastfeed her dragons. They will not eat the meat she tries to feed them until she remembers her brother
Viserys
 saying that only men and dragons eat cooked meat. From then on, the dragons devour several times their
own weight in seared meat every day and begin to prosper.
Each night, Daenerys lets one of the dragons ride on her shoulder, while 
Irri
 and 
Jhiqui
 carry the other two in a cage
slung between their horses. One day, 
Aggo
 says her black dragon is 
Balerion
 reborn. Daenerys recalls that her
ancestor 
Aegon I Targaryen
's dragons were named after the gods of Old 
Valyria
, but decides to name hers after
those the gods have taken from her. She names the green-and-bronze one 
Rhaegal
 after her brother 
Rhaegar
Targaryen
, the cream-and-gold one 
Viserion
 after her brother Viserys, and the black-and-scarlet one 
Drogon
 after
her husband Drogo.
Yet even as her dragons prosper, her 
khalasar
 withers. Some are forced to walk because there are no longer enough
horses to go around. Doreah, who has been ill for a while, develops a fever and finally grows too weak to mount her
horse. Daenerys stops the 
khalasar
 and personally cares for the girl who taught her how to seduce Khal Drogo,
holding her hand until she finally dies.

As the environment continues to worsen, the Dothraki begin to fear the comet has led them to some hell, and even
Daenerys begins to despair. She goes to Ser Jorah to ask if the waste has an end. He assures her it does end, though
the way is harder than he dared to think. Daenerys notes that the knight is still suffering from the wound he took
fighting
 
Qotho
, but he still urges their only choice is to press on.
A few days later, her outriders return with news of a city that even Ser Jorah can tell her nothing about. She sends
her 
bloodriders
 Aggo, 
Jhogo
, and 
Rakharo
 to scout the city. When they report that the city is dead, Jhiqui insists that
such places are haunted by ghosts and best avoided. This does not dissuade Daenerys, and she leads her 
khalasar
into the deserted city. Inside, Daenerys passes an empty plinth and wonders if its statue now stands in 
Vaes Dothrak
.
They find fruit trees and fresh water, but also bones. Irri mutters about ghosts, but Daenerys assures her dragons are
more powerful, though food, water, and fodder are more important. After Daenerys settles into her tent and bathes in
sand, Ser Jorah arrives to give her a peach, which she savors. She declares that the gods were good to lead them to
this place, and Jorah replies that they should rest and gather their strength.
Daenerys mentions that her handmaids worry about ghosts, but the knight points out there are ghosts everywhere.
Daenerys remembers those she has lost and asks the name of Ser Jorah's ghost. He names his second wife, the
beautiful 
Lynesse Hightower
. When Daenerys presses for more information, Jorah explains that his home on the
remote 
Bear Island
 is cold and rustic. His first wife, a 
Glover
, whom he loved after a fashion, died from her third
miscarriage after ten years of marriage. Soon after, he fought in the 
Greyjoy Rebellion
 and earned his knighthood
when he followed 
Thoros of Myr
 through the breach at 
Pyke
. Afterward, King 
Robert
 held a tourney outside
Lannisport
, where Jorah met Lynesse and held 
Jaime Lannister
 to a draw in the final joust, earning the champion's
laurel and naming Lynesse queen of love and beauty. That night, drunk on wine and victory, he asked Lord 
Leyton
Hightower
 for his daughter's hand, and they were married there in Lannisport. However, Bear Island was a
disappointment to Lynesse. Jorah went to great expense to import what she wanted, and when that failed he entered
tourneys but never distinguished himself again. Each loss cost a suit of armor and a charger, and soon he was broke.
Lynesse was unwilling to give up her jewels, so Jorah did shameful things for gold. When he heard 
Eddard Stark
was coming to punish him, he fled with his wife to 
Lys
. In half a year, their money was gone and he was forced to
become a 
sellsword
, and while he was away fighting, Lynesse moved in with the merchant prince 
Tregar Ormollen
.
When Daenerys asks, Jorah explains that he hates Lynesse almost as much as he loves her. As Jorah is leaving,
Daenerys asks what Lynesse looked like, and Jorah replies that she looked a lot like her.
After he leaves, Daenerys realizes Ser Jorah loves her and wants her, not as a queen but as a woman. She tries to
image herself with him, but it is no good. She also noticed his longing to return to Bear Island. He can never have
her, but she hopes one day to give him back his home and his honor. That night she dreams of riding dragons with
Drogo.
The next morning, she calls her bloodriders and orders them each to take three healthy horses and plenty of supplies
to go scouting: Aggo to the southwest, Rakharo to the south, and Jhogo to the southeast. While they wait for the
bloodriders to return to the city (which they name 
Vaes Tolorro
) the 
khalasar
 has a chance to recover, and Daenerys
tends to Ser Jorah's hip wound, which finally starts to heal.
Rakharo returns first to report the wasteland stretches south all the way to the ocean. Daenerys puts him in charge of
pulling up the plaza so more grass might grow for the horses. Aggo returns next, having found only two deserted
cities smaller than Vaes Tolorro. Daenerys sets him to work repairing the city gates. Jhogo is the last to return, much
later, bringing three queerly garbed strangers from the great city of 
Qarth
: the great warlock 
Pyat Pree
, the merchant
prince 
Xaro Xhoan Daxos
 of the 
Thirteen
, and 
Quaithe
 of the Shadow. They come seeking dragons, and Daenerys
declares they have found them.

Jon Snow
 helps investigate 
Whitetree
, the fourth abandoned 
wildling
 village they have encountered. 
Lord
Commander
 
Jeor Mormont
 dispatches Jon with a report for 
Samwell Tarly
 to send back to 
Castle Black
. After a
short talk with Sam, Jon returns to Mormont to discuss how 
his uncle
 might have reacted to the abandoned villages.
Synopsis
The abandoned village of 
Whitetree
 is dominated by the largest tree 
Jon Snow
 has ever seen. The 
weirwood
 shades
the entire village beneath its canopy, but the size does not disturb Jon as much as the face, whose jagged mouth is
large enough to swallow a sheep and contains human bones. 
Lord Commander
 
Mormont
 notes that the tree is old,
and Jon adds that it is powerful as well.
Thoren Smallwood
 declares he now understands why the men feared the 
heart trees
 when they first came to
Westeros
 and cut them down. Jon replies that 
his father
 claimed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree, and
Mormont agrees his father said the same. Mormont asks Jon to retrieve the blackened skull from the ashes. When he
reaches in, Jon finds another skull under it. As he examines the skull, Mormont wishes he had asked why the
wildlings burn their dead when there were still a few around to ask. Jon remembers the 
wight
 he fought and is
certain he knows the reason.
Musing on what they might learn if bones could talk, Mormont orders the houses searched. Jon is paired with
Eddison Tollett
, nicknamed Dolorous Edd. As they search, Dolorous Edd says the dead walking is bad enough, but
now Mormont wants them talking, too. The grey-haired squire adds that the dead might lie, or be full of tedious
complaints. Entering one of the houses, Jon notes the dirt floor and lack of furnishing and calls it is a dismal place to
live. Dolorous Edd replies that he was born in such a house, but then fell on hard times.
They find nothing, as expected. Whitetree is the fourth village they have searched and each has been as empty.
When Jon asks what he thinks happened here, Dolorous Edd responds he does not want to imagine. Reemerging,
they find 
Chett
 using the hounds to search and cursing angrily. When Jon meets Chett's eyes, he can tell there is no
love lost between them. Thoren Smallwood, dressed in the late Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
's armor and cloak and looking
more lordly than Mormont, declares there were wildlings here a year ago. 
Jarman Buckwell
 replies that much can
change in a year. Ser 
Mallador Locke
 opines that fewer wildlings means fewer worries. Then 
Bedwyck
, a five-foot
ranger known as Giant, descends from the giant tree to report a lake to the north and low hill to the west. With three
hours of daylight left, Mormont decides to head for the lake to make camp.
After writing a report to 
Maester Aemon
, the Lord Commander sends Jon to find 
Samwell Tarly
 to send the
message. Jarman Buckwell's scouts ride out first, followed by Thoren Smallwood's vanguard, Mormont's main force,
the baggage train under Ser Mallador Locke, and finally the rear guard under Ser 
Ottyn Wythers
; a total of 200 men
and 300 horses. As he rides, Jon exercises his scarred fingers to keep his sword hand from growing stiff and clumsy.
He is likely to need his sword hand 
beyond the Wall
, especially now. The black brothers left 
Castle Black
 in good
spirits, but the silence of the wood has unnerved them all. Not only have the wildlings disappeared, but the game as
well. Even the veteran rangers agree the 
haunted forest
 has never seemed so haunted.
He finds Sam watering the horses who carry the raven cages. A few of the ravens' shrieks sound like words, and Jon

asks if Sam is teaching them to speak. Sam explains three of them to say "snow." Jon comments that 
one bird
croaking his name was enough. When Sam asks about Whitetree, Jon gives him Mormont's report. Sam dispatches a
raven with the message, lamenting that he wishes it could carry him back as well. When Jon asks about him still
being afraid, Sam admits he is not as frightened as he was. At first he could not sleep for fearing every noise was a
wildling creeping up to kill him, but now he knows there are no wildlings around. Jon remarks to himself that two
hundred brave men left 
the Wall
 and only Sam, the self-confessed coward, is growing less afraid.
Sam says he is sore from the rough living, but he is working on his maps. Jon jokingly threatens to volunteer Sam as
an outrider, which Sam emphatically protests. Sam then admits he hoped they would stay in the village under a roof.
Jon points out that their are not enough houses for everyone and rides off again.
Ghost
, who has been hunting well away from the line of march, appears as Jon is swinging wide of the village to
avoid the congested column. The white wolf has been having no more luck than the foragers. Jon remembers telling
Dywen
 that their numbers were probably frightening away the game, but Dywen only agreed the game was being
frightened by 
something
.
When Jon rejoins Mormont, he mentions that Sam is teaching the ravens to talk. Mormont snorts that he will regret
that, as they make a lot of noise but say nothing worth hearing. They ride in silence for a while before Jon comments
on what his uncle 
Benjen
 would make of the empty villages. Mormont continues Jon's thought that Benjen would
have pushed on to find out why, and perhaps someone or something did not want that known. Mormont declares that
when 
Qhorin Halfhand
 joins them, they will be 300 men and not so easy for an enemy to deal with. He promises Jon
that they will find them, but Jon wonders if they will be found instead.

Arya
 and the others decide to spend the night in the holdfast of an 
abandoned town
 on the southern shores of the
Gods Eye
. That night, 
Lannister
 raiders led by Ser 
Amory Lorch
 arrive to demand they open the gate. When 
Yoren
refuses, a fight breaks out. As the battle turns against them, Yoren orders Arya to get the survivors out through an
escape tunnel in the burning barn. Before escaping Arya throws an axe to the three criminals trapped in their wagon.
Synopsis
The river
 seems a peaceful place to 
Arya
 until 
Koss
 finds a soldier decomposing in the reeds. 
Yoren
 sends 
Dobber
 to
search the body for valuables and, finding they cannot cross, he takes Koss upriver and sends 
Woth
 and 
Gerren
downriver to look for a ford. While they wait, 
Lommy
 and 
Tarber
 go wading and throw mud at 
Hot Pie
 while Arya
watches 
Kurz
 catch a fish with his hands, thinking it must be easier than catching cats.
The scouts return at midday to report only a burnt bridge. Drawing a map in the mud, Yoren explains that the river
flows south from the 
Gods Eye
. With no way to cross the river without abandoning the wagons, they cannot pass
along the lake's western shore as planned, and going east will bring them back to the 
kingsroad
. Yoren decides to go
north to where the river meets the lake, sell all they have to hire a boat in 
the town
 there, and sail across the lake to
Harrentown
. There they can buy new mounts or take refuge at 
Harrenhal
, the seat of Lady 
Shella Whent
, a known
friend of the 
Night's Watch
.
Hot Pie worries about ghosts at Harrenhal, but Yoren only spits. Arya recalls 
Old Nan
's stories about Evil King
Harren
 and how 
Aegon
 unleashed his 
dragons
 to turn the castle into a pyre. Old Nan told that fiery spirits still haunt
the castle and sometimes men who sleep there are found burnt alive in the morning, but Arya does not believe the
stories. It will be knights at Harrenhal, not ghosts, and she can reveal herself to Lady Whent and maybe be escorted
home.
They pass abandoned cottages and untended fields to find the town deserted as well, which frightens Arya when she
wonders what scared the people away. Growing apprehensive, Yoren leaves ten recruits to guard the wagons and
splits the rest up to search the town while he investigates the towerhouse. 
Woth
 once pulled an oar on a galley, so
Yoren orders him to take Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy to search for boats.
The docks are empty except for a rotten rowboat, and Arya realizes the people took all the boats when they fled.
Lommy and Hot Pie suggest they search a nearby inn for food and ale, but Woth insists on sticking to Yoren's
orders. Despondent, Arya washes her face in the lake and wonders if she could swim all the way to 
Winterfell
. Woth
shouts at her to help search, so she does, but they only find some sails and nails.
It is dark when Yoren returns to report the towerhouse empty. He dismisses suggestions of patching the rowboat or
building a new one, but he is intrigued by Gendry's idea of a raft. However, a raft would mean leaving the wagons
and staying close to shore, so Yoren decides to sleep on it. Lommy asks if they can stay at the inn, but Yoren
chooses the holdfast for its protective wall. Arya argues they should not stay at all since even the lord ran away.
Lommy mocks her as scared, but Yoren declares her reasoning smart, except the Night's Watch takes no part and
nobody is their enemy. Arya thinks that nobody is their friend either, but she remains silent to avoid seeming craven.

The holdfast is surrounded by a ten-foot wall of rough-cut stone with iron bars to brace the front gate. Besides the
main gate, there is a postern to the north and a narrow tunnel that leads to the lakeshore hidden under the barn.
Yoren has them park a wagon on the trap door to make sure nobody enters that way. He also assigns three watches
and sends Tarber, Kurz, and 
Cutjack
 to keep watch from the towerhouse, telling Kurz to use his hunting horn if
danger threatens. They drive their wagons and animals inside and bar the main gate. Dobber, Gendry, and Arya
draw cook duty and Arya is set to pluck the goose and two chickens Koss brings in, while Gendry splits wood and
Yoren sharpens his dirk. Everyone is quiet during the meal, even Lommy.
Arya draws second watch, but when sleep proves difficult she borrows Yoren's whetstone and hones 
Needle
 instead.
Hot Pie asks where she got such a good sword, more politely than 
before
 and she admits 
her brother
 gave it to her.
Hot Pie is surprised, as Arya has never mentioned any brothers. Arya replies that she has lots of brothers, but when
Hot Pie asks whether they are older or younger than her, she lies that they are all older, with longswords, and they
taught her how to kill people who bother her. Hot Pie insists he was just talking, but then leaves her alone. Curling
up on her pallet, Arya is annoyed by the 
crying girl
, who is crying as usual.
Arya dreams of a wolf howling and wakes at once. Pulling on her boots, she asks if anyone else heard anything.
Lommy mocks her for having wolves in her head, and Woth and 
Gerren
 assure her the wolves are safely outside.
Arya insists there was a wolf, and before the others can shout her down they hear Kurz' hunting horn. In a heartbeat,
everyone is dressing and arming themselves, while Arya rushes to the gate. As she passes the barn, 
Jaqen H'ghar
calls out for her to free the criminals so they can fight, but she ignores him.
Climbing the parapet, Arya glimpses hundreds of men with torches setting fire to the town. Gendry asks how many
there are, but they are moving too fast to count. Soon a column of riders approaches the holdfast. Arya thinks their
banner might be red, but the fires turn everything red, orange, or black. Reining up before the gates, a knight in a
spiked helm demands they open it in the name of the king. 
Reysen
 sarcastically asks which king, earning him a cuff
from Woth.
When Yoren explains that the townsfolk are gone, the knight suggests Yoren might be one of 
Beric Dondarrion
's
men and 
Thoros of Myr
 could be hiding with them. Yoren insists he only has some lads for the Night's Watch and
shows his black cloak as evidence, but the knight's banner-bearer insists it could be 
House Dondarrion
's purple
lighting bolt on black. Arya now recognizes the Lannister banner and remembers that Beric Dondarrion was the man
her father
 
sent out
 to behead Ser 
Gregor Clegane
.
The knight demands they open the gate or be known as outlaws, but Yoren demands to know who is in command. A
stout man with a manticore on his shield rides forward to introduce himself as Ser 
Amory Lorch
, bannerman to Lord
Tywin Lannister
, and repeat the order to open the holdfast in the name of the 
true
 king, 
Joffrey Baratheon
. Yoren
says it does not matter to him if they burn the town, but his band are not their foes and should be left alone. Arya is
bewildered that the raiders cannot see they are neither lords nor knights, but Gendry opines that they simply do not
care. Looking at Ser Amory's face the way 
Syrio Forel
 taught her, Arya realizes Gendry is right.
Ser Amory insists his men be allowed to verify Yoren's story, but Yoren senses a trick and refuses again. Lorch's
men mock the old recruiter, and Lorch commands a final time to open the gate. Yoren considers for a long moment
before refusing again. Lorch declares them rebels, be they black brothers or not. Yoren informs Lorch that he has
some young boys with him, but Lorch declares they will die just the same. He gives a languid signal and a spear
hurtles toward Yoren, but kills Woth instead. Lorch orders his men to storm the walls and kill everyone. More
spears fly, followed by torches.
Yoren commands them to spread out and hold the walls. Arya finds herself next to Hot Pie, who panics and says he
does not know how to fight. Arya lies that it is easy and pushes aside a sudden terror to scream, "Winterfell!" and
hack at the first hand to appear on the parapet. Warned by Hot Pie, Arya forces the next climber back off the wall.
Following her example, Hot Pie hacks the hand of a third. Ser Amory and his men have no ladders, but the walls are
rough enough to climb, so there is no end to the foes, and each man they defeat is immediately replaced.
Arya sees Yoren drive his dirk into the knight in the spiked helm, and watches Koss shoot down four axemen
attacking the gate. She sees the Lannister banner again and wishes Joffrey was present for her to stab. Dobber
wrestles a man of the walk and Lommy smashes his head, yet Lommy's celebration is cut short when he sees
Dobber's body with the man's knife in his belly. She hears 
Qyle
 beg for mercy until a knight with a wasp sigil

smashes his face with a spiked mace.
The smells of blood, smoke, iron, and piss blur together. Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie wrestle a skinny man to the
ground. Gendry breaks his sword on the man's helm, which falls off to reveal an old, frightened face. Arya feels
sorry for the man, even as she and Hot Pie are killing him. Gendry takes the man's sword and leaps down into the
yard, looking for foes. Arya notices more enemies have invaded the holdfast and follows Gendry, but then she is
uncertain which way to go, since death is all around her.
Suddenly, Yoren is shaking her. He declares that the battle is lost, and orders her to gather as many survivors as she
can and escape through the tunnel under the barn. Quick as that, he storms off again to rejoin the fighting. Arya
grabs Gendry and explains the plan. They call Hot Pie down from the walk and find Lommy bleeding from a spear
wound in his calf. They find find Gerren too, but he is too seriously wounded. The crying girl will not walk, even
when slapped, so Arya has to drag her while the others race ahead.
The barn is on fire when she arrives, and Hot Pie urges her to just leave the girl behind, but Arya stubbornly
continues to drag her. Hot Pie abandons them and scuttles back inside, but Gendry comes back to hoist the girl over
his shoulder. The barn feels like a furnace. The back wall is ablaze and the animals are kicking and screaming.
Inside their wagon, 
Biter
 and Rorge struggle frantically to get free while Jaqen H'ghar calls out to Arya in his
friendly voice. The trap door is only a few feet ahead and the fire is spreading fast, which reminds Arya of 
the
Hound
's horrible burned face. Gendry wonders how to get the little girl through the narrow tunnel. Arya tells him to
push her and asks where he left the axe. Eying the prisoners, Gendry says it is by the haven but he would save the
animals first. Arya tells him to go ahead with the girl and goes to get the axe.
Outside, she sees Koss killed on the spot after he yields. There is no sign of Yoren, but the axe is where Gendry left
it. As she wrenches it loose, a mailed hand grabs her arm. Spinning, she drives the axe up between the man's legs,
then dashes back to the barn. With heavy smoke pouring out and the animals screaming within, going back into the
barn is the hardest thing she has ever done. Inside, the roof has caught fire as well, and flaming bits of wood and
straw are raining down. The smoke is so thick she cannot see the wagon, so she crawls toward Biter's screams.
Finding the wagon, she throws the axe in and runs for the tunnel. Rorge catches it and starts hacking at the wagon.
Arya hears the wagon splinter just before she rolls headfirst into the tunnel. She drops five feet and gets dirt in her
mouth, but she does not care. She has crawled only a dozen feet when she hears the barn crash, sending a cloud of
hot smoke and black dust billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. She holds her breath and kisses the mud on the
floor. Then she cries, but she does not know for whom.

The 
small council
 discusses 
Stannis
's declaration that 
Cersei
's children are bastards born of incest. Cersei wants the
letters suppressed, but 
Tyrion
 and 
Littlefinger
 convince her they should treat the letters with contempt whilst
spreading their own rumor that Stannis' 
daughter
 is illegitimate. Tyrion leaves the council to meet with city's smiths
to commission an immense chain, then meets with 
Varys
 via a secret passage in a 
brothel
.
Synopsis
Cersei Lannister
 is furious upon learning that 
Stannis Baratheon
 is circulating letters accusing her of incest. The
small council
 has two copies of the proclamation: one received by 
Maester
 
Frenken
 at Castle 
Stokeworth
 and a
second received by Lord 
Gyles Rosby
. 
Littlefinger
 notes that if Stannis sent letters to them, every other lord in the
Seven Kingdoms
 has seen a copy. Cersei wants every copy burned so that neither 
her father
 nor 
Joffrey
 learns of
them, but 
Tyrion Lannister
 points out copies have likely been sent to 
Harrenhal
 and 
Casterly Rock
 as well and the
secret is out. When Cersei rages that she is being accused of incest, adultery, and treason, Tyrion is impressed by her
acting skills since he knows the accusations are perfectly true. He points out that such claims are to be expected
since Stannis needs a pretext to justify his rebellion. When Cersei insists she will not be called a whore, Tyrion only
thinks that Stannis never claimed 
Jaime
 paid her.
Glancing back over the letter, Tyrion points out the strange words "Done in the 
Light of the Lord
." 
Grand Maester
Pycelle
 explains it is a term commonly used in 
Free Cities
, and Littlefinger notes that 
Varys
, who is absent for
reasons known only to Tyrion, reported years ago that Stannis' wife 
Selyse
 took up with a 
red priest
. Tyrion notes
that this can be used as propaganda against Stannis.
Cersei brings up the accusations again and urges an edict to suppress its dissemination. Tyrion points out that tearing
out a man's tongue only proves you fear what he might say. When Cersei asks what he proposes, Tyrion suggests
they just let people whisper until they grow bored; without proof many will see the letter as Stannis' pathetic attempt
to justify his rebellion. Littlefinger agrees, adding that they should fight fire with fire by spreading a similar rumor
that 
Shireen Baratheon
 is a bastard and Stannis a cuckold.
Littlefinger proposes Shireen's fool 
Patchface
 should be called the father to make the story more shocking. Pycelle
exclaims that Lady Selyse would never bring a fool into her bed, but Littlefinger replies one would have to be a fool
to want to bed Selyse. He adds that the fool's devotion to the girl, and their similarly mottled, half-frozen faces will
enforce the tale. Pycelle protests that Shireen was scarred by 
greyscale
, but Littlefinger notes the smallfolk are not
known for their intelligence. Cersei smiles and calls Littlefinger wicked, and he thanks her. Tyrion recommends the
news not come from them lest it be seen as the self-serving lie it is, and Littlefinger suggests using whores and pot-
shops.
Tyrion takes his leave, and when Cersei asks why, he tells her he is having a gift made for Joffrey: a little chain.
Cersei retorts that Joffrey has lots of chains and Tyrion cannot buy his love. Tyrion replies that one day Joffrey may
treasure this chain above all others.
Bronn
 is waiting outside to inform Tyrion the smiths he summoned are waiting in his audience chamber. Tyrion
compliments the sellsword that he almost sounds like a proper courtier and teases that he will be kneeling next.

Bronn responds with, "Fuck you, dwarf." Tyrion counters with, "That's 
Shae
's task." As Bronn escorts him back to
the 
Tower of the Hand
, Lady 
Tanda Stokeworth
 hails Tyrion, but he ignores her and gives orders for his litter to be
prepared. In his chambers, he finds his timid squire 
Podrick Payne
 laying out his clothing and the 
Hand
's chain of
office.
Entering his audience chamber, Tyrion cuts straight to the point by presenting the assembled smiths with three links
of an immense chain and commanding them to make a thousand more. He orders every forge and every metalworker
in the city put to work making and joining more links, and puts Goodman 
Ironbelly
 in charge of seeing it done. The
smiths immediately ask about the queen's orders for armor and weapons, and her threat of crushed hands for missed
quotas. Tyrion assures them no hands will be crushed, thinking of the love Cersei is creating for them among the
smallfolk. Ironbelly asks about supplies of iron and coke, and Tyrion promises Lord Baelish will see they have
enough coin while the 
City Watch
 will help them find and melt down every horseshoe in the city for iron if required.
Then an older smith, 
Salloreon
, complains that such work is only fit for common smiths, not master armorers like
himself. He offers to make Tyrion a terrifying suit of plate instead, but Tyrion replies that he can either make chains
or wear them, and then departs.
Outside, Bronn waits with a litter and an escort of 
Black Ears
. As he travels, Tyrion muses that he has set hundreds
of carpenters to building fishing boats instead of catapults, opened the 
kingswood
 to hunters, and even sent gold
cloaks foraging to deal with hunger in the city, but people still give him accusing looks. He also reflects that Cersei
missed the importance of Stannis declaring himself king, and wonders what 
Renly Baratheon
 will make of it.
Peering out into the streets he wonders who the informers in the crowd are, and decides they are likely the most
innocent-looking ones.
His destination is a two-story 
brothel
 behind 
Rhaenys's Hill
. Inside, he is greeted by a tall, black-skinned woman
who names herself 
Chataya
. When Tyrion asks to see the girls, Chataya recommends a dark-skinned girl of 16 who
turns out to be her daughter 
Alayaya
; in the 
Summer Isles
 being a whore is considered an honor and pleasing to the
gods. Tyrion wonders what the gods have to do with it, and jests that he would be much more religious if he could
pray with his cock.
Leading Tyrion upstairs to the turret room, Alayaya directs him into a wardrobe, where he finds a secret panel and
beyond that a hidden shaft leading down to an underground tunnel where Varys waits in disguise. Tyrion asks if
Chataya can be trusted, and Varys explains she has no love for the queen and is grateful to be rid of 
Allar Deem
.
When Tyrion asks how the brothel came to have a secret entrance, Varys explains that the tunnel was dug for
another Hand who would not enter the house openly.
Emerging into a stable, Varys helps disguise Tyrion as child and saddle a horse. Tyrion tells him that Stannis has
accused Jaime and Cersei of incest, and asks how he came by that suspicion. Varys responds that perhaps someone
whispered it to him, or else he simply looked at color of a bastard's hair as 
Jon Arryn
 and 
Eddard Stark
 did; after all,
each of the eight bastards of King 
Robert
 that Varys knows had black hair regardless of their mother's color. Tyrion
wonders if the whisper might have come from Littlefinger, but Varys refuses to confirm. After Varys helps him
mount, Tyrion declares to Varys that he is either his best friend or his worst enemy. Varys replies that he feels quite
the same about Tyrion.

Bran
 receives the lords of 
the North
 at 
Winterfell
 for the 
harvest feast
. Each has business to discuss, and many are
interested in wedding Lady 
Donella Hornwood
, whose 
husband
 and 
only son
 have died in the south. Lady
Hornwood herself is concerned that 
Ramsay Snow
, the bastard of 
the Dreadfort
, means to seize her lands. The night
Cley Cerwyn
 arrives with news that 
Stannis
 has declared 
Joffrey
 a bastard, Bran dreams of a 
golden man
 throwing
him from a tower.
Synopsis
Bran
 is awake long before dawn. 
Winterfell
 is full of guests for the 
harvest feast
, and he must play the prince. He
always wanted to be a 
knight
, not a prince, but now that he is broken he must spend his days listening to old men
discuss things he barely understands. Lord 
Wyman Manderly
 arrived from 
White Harbor
 two day ago, and Bran
welcomed him from 
his father
's high seat. Afterward, Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
 said he had done well, but Manderly was
only the first. Many lords with matters to discuss with their overlord will use the feast as a pretext.
Hodor
 arrives to help him dress. Bran prefers to dress himself, but some things are just quicker with help. Bran is
astonished by Hodor's deftness and strength and says he could have been a great knight if the gods had left him his
wits. Mounting into his basket, Bran instructs Hodor to carry him downstairs.
Out in the yard, Bran watches the Walders jousting against quintains. Bran notes that 
Little Walder
 struck harder,
but 
Big Walder
 sat his horse better. When Little Walder sees Bran on Hodor's back, he remarks that Hodor is an
ugly horse, which angers Bran. The Walders continue to insult Hodor and Little Walder begins bumping him with
his horse. Bran grows angrier and threatens to sic 
Summer
 on them, but Little Walder points out he is wearing armor
and says he wants a wolfskin cloak. Then, 
Maester
 
Luwin
 arrives to break up the argument and chastise the
Walders. Big Walder has the grace to look ashamed, but Little Walder remains haughty. Luwin reminds them that
good lords protect the weak and warns them to stay out of the 
godswood
. He then calls on Bran to come with him to
meet Lord Wyman.
The maester tells Bran he was right to defend Hodor, but it should not have been necessary to fetch him to meet
Lord Wyman. Bran apologizes and asks if they will talk of the 
war
. Luwin reminds Bran that he is only eight and
should not speak unless spoken to. Inside, Bran is seated in his father's chair with Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik
beside him. The morbidly obese Lord Wyman Manderly is very pleasant, insisting no prince is ever late. He talks
about White Harbor being the best place to mint currency and build a fleet for Robb's new kingdom. Talk of
warships piques Bran's interest and he thinks it a splendid idea, but no one asks him. The meeting continues through
lunch, during which Lord Wyman inquires about his widowed cousin Lady 
Donella Hornwood
, whose 
husband
 and
only son
 died on the 
Green Fork
 and in the 
Whispering Wood
. He suggests that he would be interested in marrying
her, or she could wed his son Ser 
Wendel
. Later, Lord Wyman informs them that 
Tywin Lannister
 has offered to
ransom his son Ser 
Wylis
 (who was taken captive on the Green Fork) if he withdraws his support for King 
Robb
. He
has of course refused, but hopes for an equitable prisoner exchange as soon as possible.
Lady Hornwood arrives during supper, and Bran expresses his condolences to the grief-stricken widow. She thanks
them, but asks leave to rest and continue the next day. The next morning's talk is devoted to preparations for the
coming winter until Lady Hornwood warns them that 
Roose Bolton
's bastard son 
Ramsay Snow
 is massing men at

the Dreadfort
 and refuses to explain his purpose. When Ser Rodrik says he does not know the man, Lady Hornwood
explains that Ramsay lived with his mother until 
Domeric Bolton
 died and left Roose without an heir. She adds that
Ramsay brought along an equally-cruel servant named 
Reek
 who is said to never bathe. The two hunt together, and
not for deer, and there are other tales that are hard to believe even of a Bolton.
Lady Hornwood fears Ramsay covets her lands now that her husband and son are gone. Bran wants to give her a
hundred men, but Ser Rodrik only promises to protect her lands and adds that in time it may be prudent for her to
wed again. She remarks that she is beyond childbearing age yet attracts more suitors than ever. She promises to
marry if commanded, but there is no one to her liking. She points out that Lord Manderly is too big to share a bed
with or lie underneath; Bran knows that men sleep on top of their wives, and imagines sleeping under Lord Wyman
would be like sleeping under a horse. Ser Rodrik sympathizes and promises to look for a suitor more to Lady
Hornwood's taste, at which point she hints interest in Ser Rodrik himself.
After she leaves, Maester Luwin points out Lady Hornwood's hint, which makes Ser Rodrik uncomfortable. Bran
notes that she is sad; Ser Rodrik adds that she is also gentle and not unattractive, but still a threat to the realm. Bran
is incredulous, but the maester explains that without a direct heir there will be many claims to her lands, which Robb
must adjudicate as the liege lord. When Bran suggests Ser Rodrik, the old castellan replies that he is only a knight
and too old; when he dies the problem would resurface. Thinking of his own half-brother, Bran next suggests Lord
Hornwood's twelve-year-old bastard 
Larence Snow
. Ser Rodrik doubts that will please Lady Hornwood, but Maester
Luwin insists they consider it.
Bran asks to be excused and Ser Rodrik agrees, saying he did well. There are still a few hours of daylight, so Bran
goes to the godswood to visit Summer. He has Hodor take him to his favorite place by the pool near the 
heart tree
.
Suddenly, a naked 
Osha
 explodes out of the cold pool, startling everyone. When Bran asks about the cold, Osha says
she likes it. She notices Bran staring at her and asks if he has never seen a naked woman. Bran has bathed with his
sisters and seen serving women bathing, but Osha is hard and covered in scars, which she tells him were earned
fighting men, mostly 
Night's Watch
; she even killed one. Then she mentions overhearing that the Walders mocked
Hodor. Bran recalls that Hodor never fights and says that 
Septon
 
Chayle
 says Hodor has a gentle spirit. Osha replies
that Little Walder is well named: big outside, little inside, and mean to the bones. Then she asks if Bran has had any
more wolf dreams. When he say no, Osha declares a prince should lie better and begs his leave before hurrying back
to the kitchens.
That night, Bran dreams of a 
weirwood
 calling to him and a 
three-eyed crow
 pecking at his face. He wakes to
clamor of the arrival of the 
Umbers
 from beyond the 
Last River
. The next day, he greets their leaders, two of
Greatjon Umber
's uncles: 
Mors Umber
 (known as "Crowfood" because he lost an eye to a crow that thought him
dead), and 
Hother Umber
 (known as "Whoresbane" for reasons no one will tell Bran). Mors immediately asks to
wed Lady Hornwood; Luwin and Rodrik explain she is grieving but promise to consider it. Hother asks for
longships to stop 
wildling
 raids across the 
Bay of Seals
; Ser Rodrik recommends Hothor cooperate with Lord
Manderly to provide lumber and receive shipwrights and sailors.
During the audience, the steward of 
Deepwood Motte
 arrives with apologies from Lady 
Sybelle Glover
, who is
tending to her young children. Bran quickly realizes the steward is the true ruler while Lord 
Galbart Glover
 and his
brother 
Robett Glover
 are away fighting. After discussing the harvest, Ser Rodrik questions the steward about
Larence Snow, and afterward Maester Luwin praises Bran's notion of making the bastard heir to Hornwood and says
he will make a good lord for Winterfell one day. Bran protests that Robb's sons with his 
Frey
 girl will be lords
instead of him, but Ser Rodrik points out that nothing is certain; he has only his daughter 
Beth
 despite three
marriages, and his brother 
Martyn Cassel
's line died with his son 
Jory
 despite having four sons.
The next day, 
Leobald Tallhart
 from 
Torrhen's Square
, who arrived the day before, has his audience. He brings word
that his nephew 
Benfred Tallhart
 is raising his own company of young lancers who all think themselves another
young wolf; Leobald dismissed them as young rabbits once, so now they call themselves the 
Wild Hares
. Bran
remembers Benfred visiting Winterfell and being friendly with Robb and 
Theon Greyjoy
. Clearly displeased, Ser
Rodrik orders that Benfred is to remain at Torrhen's Square as commanded. Then Leobald mentions that his own
wife 
Berena
 was sister to Lord Halys Hornwood and suggests sending his younger son 
Beren
 to foster with Lady
Hornwood, saying he may even take up the Hornwood name if made heir. Bran has learned the proper answer and
promises to bring up the matter with Robb and Lady Hornwood. After the audience, Maester Luwin states that he
likes the idea, but Ser Rodrik thinks it will be hard for a boy to hold the lands. Luwin admits that with 
the Riverlands

now part of the kingdom, it may be best to wed her to one of the lords of the 
Trident
.
In the days that follow, ravens arrive with regrets from the other Houses. The bastard Ramsay Snow will not be
joining them, the 
Mormonts
 and 
Karstarks
 have all gone south, Lord 
Ondrew Locke
 is too old, Lady 
Lyessa Flint
 is
too pregnant, and there is sickness at 
Widow's Watch
. That leaves just Lord 
Howland Reed
, who has not left his
swamps in sixteen years, and the 
House Cerwyn
, whose Lord 
Medger Cerwyn
 is a captive of the Lannisters.
Then, one blustery day, fourteen-year-old 
Cley Cerwyn
 arrives with a dozen lancers while Bran is riding 
Dancer
 in
the yard. Cley has always been a friend to Bran and his brothers and he immediately asks if 
Stannis Baratheon
 wrote
Winterfell about 
Joffrey Baratheon
 being illborn. Bran suddenly feels like a giant hand is crushing his chest. When
Cley asks if he is alright, Bran declares that Robb will beat Stannis, too. That night he does not have the dreamless
sleep he prayed for. The three-eyed crow pecks out his eyes, telling him to fly. Then the crow pecks his brow until it
pecks through his skull and then, suddenly, Bran can see again. He is climbing to a tower, slipping. He calls for help
and a 
golden man
 appears above him, saying, "The things I do for love," and then tossing him out into empty air.

Tyrion
 meets with 
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
, 
Littlefinger
, and 
Varys
 in turn, and gives each a secret plan. To Pycelle,
he gives a secret letter for Prince 
Doran Martell
; to Littlefinger, a plan to give 
Lysa Arryn
 her 
husband
's killer and
wed Princess 
Myrcella
 to 
Robert Arryn
; and to 
Varys
, a plan to give Prince 
Doran Martell
 his 
sister
's killer and
Prince 
Tommen
 as a ward.
Synopsis
During breakfast, 
Tyrion
 asks 
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 to send his serving girl away and hands him two sealed copies
of a secret letter for Prince 
Doran Martell
. He insists Pycelle send his swiftest birds immediately; breakfast will
keep, but the realm may not with Lord 
Renly Baratheon
 leading his host up the 
roseroad
, and no one knowing when
Lord 
Stannis Baratheon
 will sail from 
Dragonstone
. Pycelle moves ponderously to obey, and Tyrion notes that his
maester
's chain is far more ornate than the standard.
Tyrion has plenty of time to finish part of his breakfast before he sees the ravens take off. He then inspects Pycelle's
well-organized potions and steals a small bottle from the high shelf. He is back eating when the maester returns to
inquire about the message, but Tyrion insists it is best kept a secret. When Pycelle suggests bringing the matter to
the 
small council
, Tyrion replies that the council exists to advise King 
Joffrey
, who is only thirteen. When ascked
about the queen, Tyrion replies that 
Cersei
 carries a great weight already and Pycelle reluctantly agrees it is best not
to add to her burden, given the frailty of her sex. Tyrion wonders what 
Eddard Stark
 would think of that description,
but says nothing and asks to be informed secretly when a reply comes from 
Dorne
. As he departs, Tyrion thinks to
himself, 
One
.
In the lower bailey, Tyrion finds 
Bronn
 (who is now armored as befits his role as captain of the 
Hand
's guard)
watching the men-at-arms practice. He jokingly notes that Bronn is paying no attention to a pair of pretty serving
girls. Bronn replies that he can buy all the sex he wants, but one day his vigilance could save his life. He points out
that the 
hedge knight
 named Ser 
Tallad
 is the best, but he falls into a rhythm that will be his death when he faces
Bronn.
As they cross the bailey, Bronn informs Tyrion that thirty supplicants await him, including Lady 
Tanda Stokeworth
's
page with an invitation to supper. Lady Tanda thinks Tyrion would be the prefect consort for her soft, dimwitted
daughter 
Lollys
 and is plying him with food; Tyrion tells Bronn to send his regrets. There is also a moneylender
from 
Braavos
 wanting repayment of a loan; Tyrion orders him directed to 
Littlefinger
, who will find a way to put
him off. Another supplicant is a minor lordling from the 
Trident
 who wants recompense for the destruction done to
his land. Seeing the value of a compliant 
river lord
, Tyrion promises to make time for him tomorrow and orders him
given good quarters, a meal, and new boots courtesy of King Joffrey. There are also many food merchants who want
protection from the hungry mobs who recently roasted a baker in his own oven for overcharging. Tyrion suggests
gold cloaks
, but Bronn notes there were gold cloaks in the mob, and the merchants demand to see the king. Tyrion
calls them fools since Joffrey would send them off with whips and spears. Bronn also reports that Ser 
Alliser Thorne
of the 
Night's Watch
 has arrived with a rotten hand. Tyrion recalls his distaste for the man, and orders him given a
dirty cell and left waiting.
After Bronn departs to carry out his orders, Tyrion encounters Cersei and her retinue by the main gate. When he

asks where she is going, Cersei claims she is going to inspect the defenses in light of Renly marching from
Highgarden
. She believes he could arrive by the full moon, but Tyrion assures her that Renly is traveling too slowly
and stopping to feast and hold court at a different castle each night. Tyrion is dubious that Renly actually has the
rumored 100,000 men, but Cersei snaps that he has all the power of 
Storm's End
 and Highgarden; only 
House
Redwyne
 has held back, and that is thanks to her taking the twins 
Horas
 and 
Hobber
 captive. Tyrion retorts that it is
a shame she let Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 slip away, and points out Renly has 
Robb Stark
 at 
Riverrun
 and 
Tywin Lannister
 at
Harrenhal
 to concern him. He adds that he would do the same as Renly: progress slowly, flaunt his power, watch,
and wait. If Robb defeats Tywin, the south will fall into Renly's hands like a windfall, and if Tywin defeats Robb,
Renly can attack the weakened Lannister host. Cersei demands Tyrion make their father bring his army to King's
Landing, but Tyrion points out he has never been able to make Lord Tywin do anything. Ignoring this answer, she
asks what he is doing to free 
Jaime
, who is worth a hundred of Tyrion. Tyrion quips that they do not have a hundred
of him to trade to 
Catelyn Stark
. Angered, Cersei declares him worse than useless and leaves.
In truth, Tyrion fears Stannis twice as much as Renly; Renly is beloved but inexperienced in war, while Stannis is
cold, hard, and inexorable. The spies sent to Dragonstone are ominously silent, though 
Lysene
 war galleys have
been spotted and 
Varys
 reports 
sellsail
 captains taking service with Dragonstone. If Stannis and Renly attack
together by sea and land there will be no chance for Joffrey, or himself.
Podrick Payne
 meets him at the door of his solar and shyly informs him that Petyr Baelish is inside. He finds
Littlefinger seated by the window, watching Joffrey kill hares with his new crossbow in the yard below. Observing
Joffrey's poor aim, Littlefinger quips that the hares are winning and advises Pod to invest in pots since the castle will
soon be overrun with hares and they will be eating potted hare for every meal. Tyrion dismisses Pod and offers
Littlefinger refreshment. Littlefinger politely declines, noting that he has heard to drink with Tyrion is to risk being
sent to the Wall.
Tyrion compliments Littlefinger on his clothing and notes his 
Valyrian steel
 dagger with the 
dragonbone
 hilt. There
is mischief in Littlefinger's eyes when he responds that is a trifle plain and offers it to Tyrion as a gift. Tyrion
refuses, infuriated that Littlefinger knows why he mentioned the dagger and is mocking him because he thinks
Tyrion cannot touch him. Tyrion reflects that his brother Jaime is famous for his gilded steel armor, but if ever a
man truly armored himself in gold it is Littlefinger. Ten years ago, 
Jon Arryn
 gave him a minor position in customs,
where he soon tripled the revenue. Within three years he was master of coin, and now the crown's revenues are ten
times what they were. The crown's debts have grown vast, too, but Littlefinger is a master juggler and borrows so he
can put the gold to work. He invests in wagons, shops, ships, houses, agribusiness, textiles, and moneylending, and
the 
gold dragons
 breed and multiply. At the same time, Littlefinger moved his own men into place:, the 
King's
Counter
, the 
King's Scales
, all four 
Keepers of the Keys
, and the officers managing the three mints are his, as well
nine of every ten among as the harbormasters, tax farmers, customs agents, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, and
wine factors. All of them are mostly men of middling birth, lesser lordlings, or even foreigners, but far more capable
than the highborns they replaced. No one questioned the appointments because Littlefinger is perceived as harmless
without soldiers, holdings, or marriage prospects, yet Tyrion is unsure if he can touch him.
Tyrion asks how close Littlefinger was with the 
Tully
 children during his fostering at Riverrun. Littlefinger boasts
that he took both girl's maidenheads, which Tyrion considers a very smooth lie. Tyrion explains that Catelyn and
Lysa
 would refuse any offer he might make, but they might trust Littlefinger. He adds that he hopes to sway the
more tractable Lysa by offering her Jon Arryn's true killer. Intrigued, Littlefinger asks who, but Tyrion only says
that Lysa would have to understand he only gives gifts to his friends, meaning she must first ally with the
Lannisters. Littlefinger points out that Lysa has her own woes, such as the 
Vale mountain clans
, who are now more
aggressive and better armed thanks to Tyrion. Tyrion promises to use his influence to call off the clansmen if Lysa
declares for Joffrey. Littlefinger insists Lysa will never make war on the Starks or Tullys, but Tyrion assures him
Lysa's power would only be used to oppose Renly or Stannis. In return, Tyrion will give her justice, peace, name her
son 
Warden of the East
, and wed his niece Princess 
Myrcella
 to little Lord 
Robert Arryn
.
Littlefinger asks what Cersei thinks of the ploy, and laughs when Tyrion only shrugs. Then, Littlefinger asks what
his reward will be, and Tyrion promises him Harrenhal and supremacy over the 
riverlands
 as their 
liege lord
.
Littlefinger's reaction amuses Tyrion; by birth he holds only a few stoney acres on the 
Fingers
, but Harrenhal is one
of the realm's richest domains. Littlefinger is suspicious, especially considering that 
Janos Slynt
 also received
Harrenhal for his good service, but Tyrion assures him that he is more valuable than Slynt. Appeased, Littlefinger
notes that he will likely have to bed Lysa again to get her consent and asks for a fortnight to prepare. As Littlefinger

departs, Tyrion thinks to himself, 
Two
.
Next, Tyrion heads to his bedchamber to await Varys. An hour later, 
Galt
 announces the eunuch's arrival, much
sooner than Tyrion expected. Varys quips that Tyrion was cruel to taunt Pycelle with a secret, but Tyrion accuses
Varys of the same thing and offers to tell him. Varys suggests his little birds may have already told him: Tyrion
hopes to dissuade 
Dorne
 from joining another faction, even though Prince Doran's hatred for House Lannister is well
known. Tyrion points out that much is obvious.
Varys notes that Prince Doran is a sentimental man who still mourns his murdered sister 
Elia
. Tyrion reveals he has
offered Doran a council seat and his sister's killer. Varys points out that Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 (who is known to have
murdered Elia) is a Lannister bannerman, but Tyrion argues that Lord Tywin will agree 50,000 Dornishmen are
worth one rabid dog. When Varys wonders aloud what might happen if Doran demands the blood of the lord who
gave the command as well, Tyrion blames Robert Baratheon since it was his rebellion. Varys points out Robert was
not at King's Landing, but Tyrion replies that neither was Doran Martell.
Varys notes that Doran will want a token of good faith as well, and asks who Tyrion will offer. Tyrion turns the
question back on Varys, who declares it must be 
Tommen
 since Tyrion cannot offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and
Lysa Arryn both. Varys' uncanny knowledge leads Tyrion to quip that he cheats at guessing games. Varys calls
Tommen a good boy, and Tyrion comments that he might even grow into a good man if they get him away from
Cersei and Joffrey soon enough. Varys acts suspicious that Tyrion might mean to make Tommen king, but Tyrion
insists Joffrey is king. Varys points out there is a flaw in the scheme named Cersei, who will never consent to part
with both Tommen 
and
 Myrcella. Tyrion says what Cersei does not know will not hurt him. When Varys asks what
will happen if she does learn of it, Tyrion declares that he would know the man who told her to be his certain enemy.
When Varys giggles at that, Tyrion thinks to himself, 
Three
.

In response to a secret note, 
Sansa
 takes advantage of a ruckus outside the 
Red Keep
 to sneak to the 
godswood
,
where she is disappointed to find 
Dontos Hollard
 instead of the dashing knight she prayed for. Nevertheless, Dontos
says he has a plan to help her escape and take her home. On her way back, Sansa runs into a drunken 
Sandor
Clegane
, who escorts her back to her chambers.
Synopsis
Sansa
 has found an anonymous note under her pillow telling her to come to the 
godswood
 tonight if she wants to go
home. She continues reading it over and over, wondering what it could mean. She has prayed so hard for a true
knight to save her, but perhaps it is only one of 
Joffrey
's cruel jokes or a clever snare to prove her disloyalty. She
fears she will only find Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 waiting for her with 
Ice
.
When her bedmaid enters unannounced to ask if she wants a bath, Sansa hurriedly hides the note. Worried the girl
saw it, Sansa asks for a fire. Once the fire is lit, she orders the girl out and decides there was something sly in her
eyes. Her servants are changed every fortnight to prevent her from befriending one, and Sansa is sure they all spy on
her. Once alone, she burns the note.
From her window, Sansa sees Ser 
Preston Greenfield
 pacing the drawbridge of 
Maegor's Holdfast
. She is free to
roam the whole 
Red Keep
, but Ser Preston will still ask where she is going at this time of night. Unable to think of a
lie, Sansa crawls into bed instead, but her thoughts keep her awake. She wishes there was someone to tell her what
to do. She misses 
Septa
 
Mordane
 and her best friend 
Jeyne Poole
, and even her sister 
Arya
, who she is sure is back
in 
Winterfell
 by now.
Hearing shouting, Sansa looks out to see armed men running to the wall and Ser Preston gone from the drawbridge.
Wondering what she is doing, Sansa dresses quickly and hides her meat knife under her cloak. After darting across
the undefended drawbridge, she passes men arming in the yard and sees three 
Kingsguard
 helping Joffrey into his
armor. Fortunately, Joffrey is busy calling for his weapons and does not see her.
The sounds fade as Sansa rushes towards the godswood, never daring to look back for fear of Joffrey. The godswood
is quiet and there is a wild feel to it even in the heart of the city, and Sansa can feel the 
old gods
 watching her. She
prefers 
her mother
's 
gods
--with their artwork, incense, rainbows, and rich fabrics and gems--but the godswood has a
certain power too, especially by night.
Fearing she is too late, Sansa is surprised by the voice of 
Dontos Hollard
 saying he feared she would not come.
When he reaches for her, Sansa shrinks back and reaches for her knife. Dontos insists he only wants to help her as
she helped him. Sansa asks if he is drunk and Dontos admits he had a cup of wine to help his courage. Drawing her
knife, Sansa asks who sent him. Dontos swears on his knight's honor that he came on his own, but Sansa recalls
Joffrey's decree and says she prayed for a knight to save her, not a drunken old fool. Dontos accepts the rebuke, but
says he hopes to find it in himself to be a knight again because of her, adding that Sansa not only saved him from
Joffrey, but also from himself.
Dontos reminds her that 
Florian
 was both a fool and the greatest knight of all. He falls to his knees and asks to be

her Florian. Still unsure, Sansa asks how he plans for her to escape. Dontos explains that the hardest part will be
getting her out of the castle. Then a ship could take her home, but he needs to find coin and make arrangements
without raising suspicions, which will take time since he is also watched. When Sansa puts away her knife, Dontos
rises and laments that he did nothing to save 
her father
. He then declares that he is not a hero like 
Ryam Redwyne
 or
Barristan Selmy
 and has won no glory in war or tourney, but Sansa has reminded him what it is to be a knight. He
pledges himself to her and vows to the old gods that he will send her home.
Assured by his solemn oath, Sansa agrees to put herself in his hands. Then she asks if he will send another letter to
let her know when, but he says that would be too dangerous. Instead, he instructs her to come to the godswood as
often as possible since nowhere else is safe. She agrees, and promises to be brave, strong, and patient above all.
Dontos urges her to leave, and Sansa kisses him softly on the cheek and calls him, "My Florian," certain that the
gods have heard her prayer.
On her way back, giddily thinking about home and the songs about Florian and 
Jonquil
, Sansa caroms into 
Sandor
Clegane
. The Hound catches her before she can fall and asks if she wants to kill them both on the serpentine steps.
When he asks what she is doing out so late, Sansa stutters that she was praying for her father and the king. The
Hound replies that he is not drunk enough to believe that story, adding that although she is nearly a woman, Sansa is
still just a little bird singing the songs they taught her. He mockingly asks her to sing him a song about knights and
fair maids, and asks if she likes knights. Sansa answers 
true
 knights, but the Hound mocks her and reminds her he is
not a knight at all. Reeling and almost falling, the Hound curses that he had too much wine, then offers to take Sansa
back to her chambers. He pushes her gently and follows her down the steps.
Upon their return, they find Ser 
Boros Blount
 guarding the drawbridge. Sansa flinches away, but the Hound insists
Blount is not to be feared. When Ser Boros asks why she is not in her chambers, Sansa's lie about the godswood
sounds more convincing than before. The Hound adds that she could not be expected to sleep with all the noise. Ser
Boros explains that preparations for 
Tyrek Lannister
's wedding feast have convinced some wretches that they should
feast, too. He adds that Joffrey led a sortie that sent the fools scurrying. Clegane states, "A brave boy," but Sansa
wonders how brave Joffrey will be when he faces her brother 
Robb
.
After crossing the drawbridge, Sansa asks why the Hound lets people call him a dog but never a knight. He replies
that he likes dogs better, and explains that his grandfather was a kennelmaster at 
Casterly Rock
 who received lands
and a 
towerhouse
 for saving Lord 
Tytos Lannister
 from a 
lion
, losing a leg and three dogs in the process. He adds
that a dog will die for you and never lie to you, which is more than little birds can do. When he adds that he never
got his song, Sansa suggests a song about Florian and Jonquil. The Hound dismisses it as a song about a fool and his
cunt, but insists he will have a song from her one day, whether she wants to or not. Sansa replies she will sing for
him gladly, but Clegane retorts,
Pretty thing, and such a bad liar. A dog can smell a lie, you know. Look around you, and take a good whiff.
They’re all liars here... and every one better than you.”

Arya VI
On their way to scout a village, 
Gendry
 unmasks 
Arya
 as a girl, forcing her to reveal her true identity. The village
turns out to be occupied by Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 and his 
men
, and Gendry is captured. During a rescue attempt, 
Hot
Pie
 panics, leading to Arya's capture as well. Later, 
a spearman
 kills 
Lommy
 rather than carry him.
Synopsis
From high in a tree, Arya can see a fishing village with some smoking chimneys. It is the first sign of life since they
fled the 
holdfast
; the 
Lannisters
 have burned or killed everything. The houses promise warmth and shelter, unless it
is Ser 
Amory Lorch
 there. Arya watches for a long time, trying to be sure, but it is too far to see for certain.
Arya and the others waited until the next night to return to the burnt village. 
Hot Pie
 and 
Lommy
 were still afraid,
but Lorch and his men were long gone. The holdfast was strewn with corpses from both sides, and scavengers had
been at them. One look was enough for 
Gendry
, but Arya insisted they find 
Yoren
, telling herself he could not be
dead. They found his body next to four Lannister men-at-arms, and Arya wondered how many men it took to bring
the black brother down. There were too many bodies to bury everyone, but Arya insisted Yoren must have a grave,
and as they dug part of her wanted to cry and part of her wanted to kick Yoren.
The only other survivors were 
Cutjack
, 
Kurz
, and 
Tarber
, who had been on look-out in the towerhouse. They came
under attack as well, but the stone tower was inflammable and inaccessible with the ladder pulled up, so Lorch's men
left them. When Kurz decided they would do better continuing north, Arya clung to the hope of still reaching
Winterfell
, but Kurz took an arrow in the shoulder pulling up the towerhouse ladder and, despite Tarber treating it
with mud and moss, the wound festered and killed him. Soon after, Tarber and Cutjack had taken the dead poacher's
weapons and hunting horn when they abandoned them. Afterward, wanting no part of any roads, Arya and the others
made their way up the muddy shore of 
God's Eye
, taking turns carrying Lommy on a makeshift litter, since the spear
wound in his calf is now so bad he cannot walk.
From her tree, Arya sees that the air over the village is full of crows, but thirty yards from shore three black swans
glide serenely over the water, oblivious to the war. Part of Arya wants to be one of them, but the other part wants to
eat one. She and the others have been living mostly on an awful-tasting acorn paste Kurz taught them to make,
though Arya and 
Weasel
 (their new name for the crying girl) have also been eating bugs and worms. Arya even tried
catching fish with her hands as 
Koss
 once did, but without success.
Beneath Arya's tree, Hot Pie barks like a dog to signal her, an old poacher's trick Kurz taught them. With the
nimbleness of a 
water dancer
, Arya returns to the ground to report her findings. Hot Pie opines that they should go to
the village and ask for food, convinced they will not be killed if they yield. Gendry accuses him of sounding like
Lommy, who has talked of little else since they escaped from the holdfast. Lommy and Hot Pie insist Lorch would
have left them alone if Yoren had yielded, but Gendry points out that knights and lordlings only take each other
captive and do not care about the lower classes.
Hot Pie and Lommy start talking about searching for dead fish, cooking crows, and even hunting boars (which Arya
knows they cannot do without boar spears, horses, and men) until Gendry proposes they steal food from the village
after he scouts it out. Arya argues that she should go instead because she is stealthier, but Gendry only agrees that

she can come with him. Hot Pie and Lommy worry about being left for the wolves, and Lommy whines that they
should yield to whomever they find because he needs some potion for his wounded leg. Gendry reminds them that
Lommy has a spear for the wolves and promises to bring back any leg potion they find, then dons his bull helm and
walks off.
During their walk, Gendry stops and says he thinks Lommy is going to die. Arya is not surprised since she has felt
Lommy's warm skin and smelled the stink off his leg. She suggests finding a 
maester
, but Gendry dismisses it as
unlikely. He suggests they should abandon Lommy, since Lommy would do the same and he is sick of Lommy's talk
of yielding, adding that Arya is the only one who's good for anything, even if she is a girl. Arya panics and insists
she is not a girl, but Gendry insists he is not stupid and to prove him wrong she will have to pull out her cock.
Desperate to escape the subject, Arya brings up the gold cloaks at the inn and says Gendry is also hiding something.
Gendry insists he does not know why they wanted him and turns the question back on Arya, asking why she thought
they were after her.
Realizing her pretense is done, Arya decides she must kill Gendry or trust him and, after pleading that Lommy and
Hot Pie cannot know, she admits she is Arya of 
House Stark
. Gendry is so shocked by the revelation that Arya is a
highborn lady that he becomes unsure how to act around her and begins calling her "m'lady" and begging her pardon
for talking about cocks and for pissing in front of her. Unsure if he is mocking her, Arya orders him to stop it, since
even Hot Pie will notice if he starts calling her that. When Gendry responds by calling her "m'lady" again, Arya
slams into his chest and he falls down, laughing. Then she gives him a kick in the side (which only makes him laugh
harder) and sets off for the village, leaving Gendry to hurry after.
As they approach the village, they smell rotting flesh. Gendry decides to circle around to the west while Arya
continues up the shore, slipping from bush to bush and stopping every few yards to listen. The smell gets worse as
she gets closer and she begins to hear horses and men. Squirming through a gap in a bramble thicket on the edge of
the village, Arya discovers a long gibbet full of corpses so decayed they hardly look like people. Arya forces herself
to look at each one in turn, telling herself she is hard as a stone. Beyond the gibbet, two spearmen guard the doors of
the slate-roofed warehouse by the water. Arya cannot make out the two limp banners nearby, but she knows the dead
men must mean Lannisters.
The two guards turn toward a shout from a third man, who appears shoving along a prisoner Arya recognizes as
Gendry by his bull helm. One of the guards snatches Gendry's helm and, after beating him around a little, they shove
him through the heavy doors of the storehouse. From inside Arya hears sobbing and a loud shriek of pain. Then the
wind flutters the banners and she makes out Lannister lion and three black dogs on a yellow field that she feels she
should remember.
Arya watches for hours as the armored men come and go, as dinner is prepared, and as night falls, but she does not
see an opportunity to free Gendry. Late at night she returns to the others to insist Hot Pie help her free Gendry. Hot
Pie insists they cannot fight twenty soldiers, but Arya argues they will only have to kill the two guards at the
storehouse. Lommy suggests they should yield or just leave Gendry, but Arya points out they need his to help carry
Lommy. When Arya insists she is going back to try, Hot Pie reluctantly agrees to come along.
As they are crawling along under the gibbet, a crow lands on Hot Pie's back and the guards hear his gasp. Hot Pie
immediately leaps up and shouts out that he yields. By the time Arya bounces up and draws 
Needle
, they are
surrounded. She slashes at the nearest man, but he blocks her with a steel-clad arm and someone else knocks her to
the ground. A third man wrenches Needle away and punches her with a armored fist when she tries to bite him.
Disoriented, Arya lies hurting and shamed by the loss of Needle, which 
Jon Snow
 gave her and 
Syrio Forel
 taught
her to use.
When she is yanked to her knees, Arya finds herself facing the biggest man she has ever seen, and suddenly she
remembers the banner with the three dogs: at the 
Hand's tourney
, Sansa told her it was the banner of 
the Hound
's
brother, Ser 
Gregor Clegane
, the Mountain that Rides, who is even bigger than 
Hodor
. After Hot Pie yields some
more and tells him about Lommy and Weasel, Ser Gregor orders them to lead his men there and walks off. As they
walk back to where Lommy and Weasel are hiding, Hot Pie promises to make pies and tarts for the four soldiers if
they do not hurt him.
When they arrive, Lommy immediately yields and explains that Weasel ran off when she heard them coming. The

soldiers ask Lommy where they can find 
Beric Dondarrion
, but Lommy has never heard the name. One of the guards
declares it a waste of time, since Arya's group do not know any more than the villagers. 
A spearman
 drifts over to
Lommy and asks if he can walk. When Lommy says they will have to carry him, the spearman replies "Think so?"
and casually drives his spear through Lommy's soft throat.

Tyrion
 visits the 
Guildhall of the Alchemists
 to discuss the production of 
wildfire
 then meets with Ser 
Cleos Frey
about 
Robb Stark
's peace terms. On the way back to the 
Red Keep
, Tyrion passes a prophet preaching of corruption
and incest. When he finds 
Cersei
 waiting in his solar, the pair argue about strategy and sending 
Myrcella
 to 
Dorne
,
which gives Tyrion the identity of an informer.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 is glad he took the advice to dress warmly, despite looking like a ball of striped fur bundled up in his
shadowskin
 cloak. Deep under 
Rhaenys's Hill
, the chill in the dank vaults behind the 
Guildhall of the Alchemists
 is
so bone-deep that even 
Timett
 retreated after a brief taste.
By the light of a sealed lamp, Tyrion inspects a fragile, grapefruit-shaped clay jar. The jar has a pebbled texture to
keep it from slipping when grasped, and when Tyrion tilts it to peer inside the murky green 
wildfire
 oozes toward
the lip. When Tyrion remarks on its thickness, the pallid and obsequious 
Pyromancer
 
Hallyne
 explains that "the
substance" (as the pyromancers call it) flows more easily as it warms.
Tyrion is annoyed by the alchemists' pretentiousness. Their habits of calling each other "wisdom" and hinting at vast
stores of secret knowledge do not match the reality of a declining guild in moth-eaten robes who no longer even
pretend to transmute metals. The 
Maesters
 of the 
Citadel
 have supplanted the once-powerful guild in almost every
respect―except the creation of wildfire, which remains a closely-guarded guild secret.
Hallyne explains that once kindled, wildfire cannot be quenched and will seep into cloth, wood, leather, or even
steel and set them afire as well. Tyrion recalls from the flaming sword of 
Thoros of Myr
 that even a thin coating can
burn for an hour, though it ruins the sword. When Tyrion asks why the wildfire doesn't seep into the clay pots,
Hallyne explains that it does, and thus they have a lower vault full of pots from the reign of King 
Aerys II
Targaryen
, whose fancy it was to shape the jars like fruit. By rights, those jars should be destroyed, but so many of
the guild's masters were killed during the 
Sack of King's Landing
 that they lack the skill and have flooded the vaults
instead. Hallyne adds that the 
whereabouts
 of much of King Aerys's stock was also lost, such as a cache of two
hundred jars discovered only last year under the 
Great Sept of Baelor
. Hallyne admits this older stock can still be
used, but urges extreme caution, since wildfire grows more volatile with age and will self-ignite if left in even direct
sunlight for too long, causing it to expand violently and create a chain reaction among nearby jars.
When Tyrion asks how many jars they have, Hallyne quotes the morning's count by Wisdom 
Munciter
 as 7,840 jars,
including 4,000 from King Aerys' older stock and says he is confident the guild will meet its promise of 10,000 jars.
Tyrion is astonished, delighted, and terrified. He knows creating wildfire is a lengthy and dangerous process, and
thought the number was only a wild boast. He insists he does not want any undue haste or defective wildfire, but
Hallyne assures him the wildfire is prepared only by trained acolytes in work cells designed to fill with sand and
smother any fires―and the hapless acolyte. Tyrion is interested in inspecting how such a cell would work, but he
does not have time.
Hallyne reiterates the importance of handling wildfire with care, suggesting that common soldiers in the frenzy of
battle may not be as considerate as trained pyromancers, and any little mistake could be catastrophic. In response,

Tyrion requests as many spare jars as possible to be delivered to each of the city gates.
As they walk back, Hallyne stresses the honor of welcoming the 
Hand of the King
 for the first time since Lord
Rossart
, who was of their guild himself. The mention of Rossart reminds Tyrion of the stories of Mad King Aerys II
using the alchemists to burn his enemies, and he decides it would be best to keep 
Joffrey
 well away from the
pyromancers to prevent him getting the same idea. As such, when Hallyne proposes hosting a feast for Joffrey,
Tyrion explains that Joffrey has forbidden feasting (at Tyrion's insistence) until the war is won. However, Tyrion has
no objections when Hallyne instead proposes a demonstration of the "dread secrets" of his ancient order at the 
Red
Keep
; there is no harm in a few magic tricks.
After navigating the twists and turns of the Guildhall, they come to the long and echoing Gallery of the Iron
Torches, where columns of wildfire flames burn around black metal columns and reflect off the black marble walls
to bathe the hall in emerald light. However, Tyrion is less impressed because he knows the cost of wildfire means
the torches have been lit only to impress him.
After bidding farewell to Hallyne on the doorstep, Tyrion descends the broad steps to the Street of Sisters near
Visenya's hill
 where Timett waits with his litter and an escort of 
Burned Men
, a most appropriate escort for a visit to
the pyromancers and a necessary precaution since Joffrey rained arrows on a hungry mob at the gates of the Red
Keep only three days past. Tyrion is surprised to find 
Bronn
 waiting as well, with two messages: Ser 
Jacelyn
Bywater
 urgently requires Tyrion at the 
Gate of the Gods
 and Cersei commands him to attend her in her chambers.
Tyrion decides to see Bywater first, as the man is not prone to waste his time and forcing Cersei to wait will make
her angry and stupid, which he prefers to composed and cunning.
The normally-busy food market inside the Gate of the Gods is nearly deserted as Tyrion crosses it to meet Ser
Jacelyn, who informs him that Ser 
Cleos Frey
 has arrived with peace terms from 
Robb Stark
. Tyrion is pleased, but
Cleos proves reluctant to discuss the terms since his orders are to deliver them directly to Cersei. Gaunt and haggard
from his journey, Cleos describes the dire situation around the 
Gods Eye
 and the 
kingsroad
, where the river lords are
burning their own crops to starve the Lannisters, who are in turn torching every village and killing the smallfolk.
Tyrion dismisses this as the way of war while Cleos adds that even with a peace banner his party was attacked twice
by 
broken men
, losing three men and another six wounded.
When Tyrion is amused by Robb's impossible peace terms, Cleos shares that Robb sits idle at 
Riverrun
, likely afraid
to face Lord 
Tywin
 in battle, and grows weaker as the river lords disperse to defend their lands. Tyrion wonders if
that was his father's plan, then informs Cleos that the terms―including the exchange of 
Willem Lannister
 and Cleos'
brother 
Tion Frey
 for 
Sansa
 and 
Arya Stark
―are unacceptable, and Cleos will be expected to carry the 
small
council
's counteroffer back to Riverrun. Cleos is not pleased with the prospect of recrossing a war zone and points
out that it is 
Catelyn Stark
 who wants this peace, not Robb. Tyrion counters that Catelyn wants her daughters and
urges Cleos to rest and await further instructions.
Tyrion rejoins Jacelyn Bywater watching several hundred recruits drilling beyond the gate. With so many refugees,
there is no lack of men joining the 
City Watch
 for food and a bed, but Tyrion has no illusions about their worth in
battle. He commends Bywater for contacting him and instructs him to give Ser Cleos and his escort every hospitality
but to keep them outside the city to hide the truth of conditions there. He also instructs Bywater to use the jars the
alchemists will deliver to train spitfire crews to handle wildfire using paint and burning oil. Bywater calls this a wise
measure, although he has no love for "alchemist's piss". Tyrion agrees, but insists he must use what he is given.
Back in his litter, Tyrion reflects that if he can use negotiations to keep Robb dreaming of an easy peace at Riverrun
until Ser 
Stafford Lannister
 readies his new host at 
Casterly Rock
, then Stafford and Lord Tyrwin can smash Robb's
forces between them. Tyrion only wishes the 
Baratheons
 would be as accommodating. With 
Renly
 creeping up the
roseroad
 with his massive southron army and 
Stannis
 poised to sail his fleet up the 
Blackwater Rush
 any day, Tyrion
takes small comfort from his stockpile of wildfire.
A commotion in Cobbler's Square pulls Tyrion out of his musings. A sizable crowd listens to the rantings of a
prophet garbed as a 
begging brother
. Calling the 
red comet
 in the sky above 
Aegon's high hill
 "the Father's
Scourge", he proclaims:
We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their

incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little 
monkey
 demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools
and give birth to monsters! Even the 
High Septon
 has forgotten the gods! He bathes in scented waters and
grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and
gold is all... but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the 
Whoremonger King
 is brought low! When
the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and
biting! There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine
of righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!
Wounded by being called a "twisted little monkey demon", Tyrion takes solace from the hoots of derision drowning
the echoing shouts as he orders the Burned Men to clear a path. He agrees with the prophet about the High Septon,
however, smiling at the memory of a joke 
Moon Boy
 made at the gluttonous cleric's expense.
Returning to the Red Keep without further incident, Tyrion ascends to his chambers in a hopeful mood, thinking all
he needs is time to piece it all together. Entering his solar, he is confronted by Cersei, who is furious at him for
ignoring her summons and plotting to sell her only daughter like a bag of oats. Knowing his 
ploy
 has worked,
Tyrion points out princesses like 
Myrcella
 are born for such marriage alliances, unless Cersei planned to wed her to
her brother 
Tommen
. Cersei declares she will not allow Myrcella to be shipped off to 
Dorne
. Without missing a
beat, Tyrion points out that Dorne will be much safer than King's Landing, and the feud between the Lannisters and
House Martell
 goes back only a generation, whereas the Dornishmen have warred with 
Storm's End
 and 
Highgarden
for a millennium.
Tyrion explains that he proposed nine-year-old Myrcella become a ward of Prince 
Doran Martell
 until she turns
fourteen, at which time she will marry 
Trystane Martell
, who is just two years older. Cersei insists Myrcella will be
a hostage, but Tyrion opines that she will be treated more kindly than Sansa Stark, especially with Ser 
Arys
Oakheart
 of the 
Kingsguard
 as her 
sworn shield
. Cersei still worries that Doran Martell might kill Myrcella to
avenge the murder of his sister 
Elia Martell
, but Tyrion insists Doran is too honorable to murder an innocent girl and
the terms are too rich to refuse: he has also promised the prince his sister's killer, a council seat, and some castles on
the 
Dornish Marches
. Cersei accuses Tyrion of offering too much without her consent, but he insists Doran would
not accept less and asks if Cersei means to offer sexual favors instead. When she slaps him, Tyrion promises her it
will be the last time, but Cersei only laughs and suggests Tyrion's faith that their father's letter will protect him might
be as misguided as 
Eddard Stark
's faith in King 
Robert
's last will. Tyrion notes to himself that unlike Lord Eddard
he has the City Watch, his clansmen, and a party of sellswords, though he supposes Stark had delusions of support
as well.
Rather than argue, Tyrion declares that Renly and Stannis will mount Myrcella's head beside Cersei's if they take the
city. To his astonishment, Cersei begins to cry, something Tyrion has not seen since they were children. Awkwardly
he moves to comfort her, but she wrenches away, which hurts more than any slap. He promises nothing will happen
to Myrcella, but Cersei calls him a liar and declares he has not kept his promise to free Jaime. Tyrion assures her
that Jaime remains safe at Riverrun until he can find a way to free him.
Cersei laments that if she were a man she would not have allowed any of this to happen. She wonders how Jaime
could let himself be captured and questions what their father is doing hiding in 
Harrenhal
. Tyrion assures her Lord
Tywin is making war, proposing that Tywin is a lion waiting to pounce while Robb is a fawn frozen by fear. Cersei
is not convinced, pointing out that Jaime would not sit idle if their father were the prisoner. To himself, Tyrion
agrees that Jaime never had any patience, but he only says that not everyone can be as bold as Jaime, but there are
other ways to win a war, and Harrenhal is strong and well situated.
Cersei adds that King's Landing is neither and Renly's host will soon be at their gates. Tyrion assures her the city
will not fall in a day, giving Lord Tywin time to march down the kingsroad to take Renly in the rear. Hungry for
reassurance, Cersei asks what will happen if Robb Stark marches. Tyrion explains that Harrenhal prevents 
Roose
Bolton
 from crossing the 
Trident
 to reunite the 
northern
 forces, and even if he could, Robb does not have the
strength to take Harrenhal and march on King's Landing. Meanwhile, Lord Tywin's army lives on the fat of the
riverlands
 and their uncle Stafford is raising another army at Casterly Rock.
Wondering how Tyrion knows all this, Cersei asks if Lord Tywin confided in him. Tyrion replies that he only
looked at a map, which causes Cersei to accuse him of mere speculation. Drawing out Robb's peace offer, Tyrion
asks why Robb would offer terms―even unacceptable terms―if he were winning. Suddenly all queen again, Cersei

asks how the terms came to Tyrion instead of her, but Tyrion quips that his job as Hand is to hand her things. As he
hands her the letter, Tyrion muses that getting slapped by Cersei is a small price to pay for her agreement to the
Dornish marriage, which he can sense he will now get. The identity of an informer is just the plum in his pudding.

 and greets 
Meera
 and 
Jojen Reed
, who arrive to represent
their father 
Howland Reed
.That night, Bran dreams of the Reeds visiting the 
direwolves
 in the 
godswood
.
Synopsis
Bran
 rides his horse 
Dancer
 into the Great Hall of 
Winterfell
 for the 
harvest feast
. He wishes 
Summer
 was with him,
but Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
 was unyielding. From the crowded benches, men shout "Stark!" and "Winterfell!" as he
passes. Bran knows they are cheering for the harvest, for victory, and for all the 
Starks
 who came before rather than
for him, but he still swells with pride and even forgets he is broken until he reaches the dais. There 
Osha
 and 
Hodor
unstrap him and carry him to the high seat. Ser Rodrik, his daughter 
Beth
, and 
Maester
 
Luwin
 are seated to Bran's
left and 
Rickon
 to his right, his hair uncut since 
their mother
 left because he bit the last girl to try. After Ser Rodrik
bellows for quiet, Bran welcomes the guests and asks them to thank the gods for 
Robb
's victories and the bountiful
harvest. His toast of "May there be a hundred more," brings an echoing cheer and Ser Rodrik says 
his father
 would
be proud.
They feast on course after course, including seafood brought by Lord 
Wyman Manderly
 from 
White Harbor
.
Manderly has also brought musicians, but only 
Hodor
 seems to be listening and the songs are drowned beneath the
talk and laughter. Ser Rodrik and Maester Luwin talk over Beth's head, while Rickon screams happily with 
Little
Walder
 and 
Big Walder
. Bran did not want the Walders at the high table but Maester Luwin reminded him they
would become kin when Robb weds one of their aunts and Arya marries their uncle 
Elmar Frey
, though Bran argued
Arya would never stand for that.
Each dish is served to Bran first, and soon he is full and must nod approval rather than taste everything. As
instructed, he sends particularly delicious dishes to the lords as a gesture of friendship: salmon to sad Lady 
Donella
Hornwood
, boar to 
Mors
 and 
Hother Umber
, goose-in-berries to 
Cley Cerwyn
, lobster to 
Joseth
 the master of horse
for training Dancer, sweets to Hodor and Old 
Nan
 because he loves them, and beets and turnips to the Walders
because Ser Rodrik insists he give them something.
Bran watches the feast detachedly, seeing everything yet a part of nothing. He sees Osha break a flagon over the
head of a 
Tallhart
 man for sliding his hand under her skirts, though another woman does not seem to mind 
Mikken
's
hand down her bodice. He watches 
Farlen
 make his red bitch beg and Old Nan pluck at the crust of a hot pie. On the
dais, he sees Lord Manderly attacking a plate of lampreys in his special wide chair, sad Lady Hornwood picking
listlessly at her food, and the Umber brothers playing a drinking game.
The heat and noise soon grow too much and Bran finds himself dreaming of the cool in the 
godswood
. Studying his
father's ornate goblet, Bran recalls the 
welcoming feast
 for King 
Robert
 and realizes everyone else is gone—either to
war, captivity, 
the Wall
, or their graves. Even the men at the tables are new, since everyone who went south with his
father is dead and the rest rode to war with Robb. When he wonders who will be missing next year and the year
after, Bran feels like crying but reminds himself he is the Stark in Winterfell and almost a man grown.
The doors to the hall open and 
Alebelly
 leads in two new guests: 
Meera
 and 
Jojen Reed
 of 
Greywater Watch
. Bran
recognizes them as 
crannogmen
 from 
the Neck
, a shy and simple folk who rarely leave their swamps, but he hears

Little Walder calling them "mudmen" and explaining to Rickon that they are thieves and cravens with green teeth
from eating frogs. As places are hurriedly prepared on the dais, Ser Rodrik explains that these must be the children
of 
Howland Reed
, a great friend and staunch companion of Bran's father during 
Robert's Rebellion
.
The slender girl Meera is armed with woven net, bronze knife, and frog spear as well as an iron helm, leather shield,
and bronze-scale jerkin. Her younger brother Jojen is unarmed and dressed all in green, which brings out the deep
green of his eyes. Kneeling before the dais, the Reeds explain that they have come to renew 
House Reed
's fealty to
the 
King in the North
. Bran explains that Robb is away fighting but says they may say their words to him. Together,
the Reeds recite their ancient oath, swearing by earth and water, by bronze and iron, and by ice and fire never to fail
the Starks of Winterfell. Unsure how to respond, Bran finally decides on "May your winters be short and your
summers bountiful," and bids them rise. Meera offers gifts of fish, frog, and fowl, and Bran offers them the meat and
mead of Winterfell in return.
Jojen immediately asks where the 
direwolves
 are and Rickon answers that they are in the godswood because
Shaggydog
 was bad. When Meera says that Jojen would like to see them, Little Walder warns that they will bite.
Pleased by the Reeds' interest, Bran promises that Summer at least will not bite and will keep Shaggydog away. He
cannot recall ever meeting a crannogman and would like to talk more, but the feast is too noisy. When he learns
from Ser Rodrik that they truly eat frogs, Bran sends the Reeds mutton, 
aurochs
, and beef stew, which they seem to
like. When Meera catches him staring, Bran blushes.
After the tables are cleared away, the music and singing grows wilder. Mors Umber grabs a passing serving girl and
begins whirling her about the floor and others soon join in. Hodor dances by himself, while Wyman Manderly and
then Cley Cerwyn partner with little Beth Cassel. Ser Rodrik approaches Lady Hornwood, but she excuses herself.
Once again unable to participate, Bran watches long enough to be polite, then calls Hodor to carry him to bed,
conscious of the stares of onlookers.
Just outside the hall, they come upon Joseth and giggling woman with her skirts above her waist. The girl screams
when she sees Hodor watching, so Bran has to tell him to leave them be. After getting help with his boots and
breeches, Bran dismisses Hodor and lies down to sleep. Then he recalls his father telling him the 
Kingsguard
 were
once a shining example, and the finest knight he ever saw was Ser 
Arthur Dayne
, who would have killed him but for
Howland Reed. His father became sad at that and spoke no further, but now Bran wishes he had asked what he
meant.
Bran goes to sleep thinking of knights, but his dreams are of wolves in the godswood again and he can hear and
smell the feast still going on. At the rattle of iron, he and his brother race to confront the strange intruders: a female
and a young male with no taint of fear. Bran recognizes Meera's voice when she asks if Jojen knew the wolves
would be so big. Jojen points out they are still growing and opines that Shaggydog is full of fear and rage but
Summer is stronger than he knows. Meera cautions her brother, but Jojen insists this is not the day he dies and
reaches out to touch Summer. At his touch, Bran loses contact and suddenly feels he is falling again.

As envoy to King

Catelyn
 arrives at 
Bitterbridge
 to find 
a great melee
 in progress. Afterward, the
champion 
Brienne of Tarth
 is granted her request to become one of Renly's 
Rainbow Guard
. That night Catelyn
attends a feast and meets privately with Renly, who insists 
Robb
 must bend the knee to him. Then, a messenger
arrives with news that King 
Stannis Baratheon
 has besieged 
Storm's End
.
Synopsis
A cruel dawn wakes 
Catelyn
 from sweet dreams of happy family life. She is weary of riding, hurting, and being
strong, but she knows she cannot allow herself to be weak today. Outside her tent, she finds 
Shadd
 stirring oats into
a kettle. Ser 
Wendel Manderly
 suggests supplementing this with roast quail, but Catelyn decides oats and bread are
sufficient since they have many leagues to travel.
Her party includes twenty of 
Robb
's best 
Winterfell
 men and five lordlings, including Ser Wendel, Ser 
Perwyn Frey
,
Lucas Blackwood
, and 
Robin Flint
, to add weight and honor to her negotiations with King 
Renly
. It is a mission
Catelyn never wanted, but Robb insisted he had no one else: Lord 
Hoster Tully
 was too ill, and he needed Ser
Brynden Tully
 to command his scouts and Ser 
Edmure Tully
 to hold 
Riverrun
 when he marched. Catelyn argued
that marching was rash, but Robb insisted waiting would make him look afraid and weaken his position, especially
since 
Lysa Arryn
 will not support him. Catelyn feared he planned to play into 
Tywin Lannister
's hand and march on
Harrenhal
, but Robb countered that he said nothing of Harrenhal. Catelyn smiles at the memory of Robb's obvious
ploy of threatening to send 
Greatjon Umber
 in her place, given how ill-suited the Greatjon is to treat with a man like
Renly. Before leaving, she wrote to 
Bran
 and 
Rickon
 and visited her father but he mistook her for 
her mother
.
Half a day's ride from Renly's camp they are spotted from a windmill and intercepted by Ser 
Colen of Greenpools
with twenty men. When Catelyn announces herself as the envoy of the 
King in the North
, Ser Colen insists that
Renly is king of all the 
Seven Kingdoms
 and escorts her to his camp at 
Bitterbridge
, where the 
roseroad
 crosses the
Mander
. With nearly all the chivalry of the south behind him, Renly's camp is immense. Thousands of cookfires
cloud the air and a vast menagerie of banners fly from a veritable forest of staffs. Monstrous siege engines line the
road, tents and pavilions dot the landscape, and the whole place bustles with people. Everywhere Catelyn sees the
golden rose of 
House Tyrell
 and across the river Renly and his 
storm lords
 have raised their own standards. Catelyn
recognizes many of the sigils, but for each one she knows there are a dozen she does not, all assembled to make
Renly a king.
Passing through a line of pavilions, they come upon 
a tourney melee
 taking place beneath the battlements of a small
castle. Less than a score of contestants remain ahorse, cheered on by hundreds of spectators. Since penetrating the
crowd proves difficult, Ser Colen asks that Catelyn's escort wait while he presents her to the king. A roar goes up
when a knight of 
House Tarth
 in cobalt armor unhorses 
Red Ronnet Connington
, but the carnage makes Catelyn
think it mad for Renly to be playing at war with real enemies all around.
Among the lords and ladies in the gallery, Catelyn recognizes stout Lord 
Mathis Rowan
, delicate Lady 
Arwyn
Oakheart
, and martial Lord 
Randyll Tarly
, but others she knows only by sigil or not at all. The handsome King
Renly sits in their midst, looking like a youthful ghost of his brother 
Robert
 and laughing with his young queen
Margaery Tyrell
, a girl of Robb's age with a shy smile and curly brown hair. Catelyn knows their marriage is the

mortar of the great southron alliance, and the rose sigil and green-and-gold colors of House Tyrell are prominent in
Renly's slender crown and velvet tunic.
Out on the field, only four men remain and both king and commons obviously favor young Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 in his
silver mail and rainbow cloak. Two others ally against the blue-clad knight from Tarth but are quickly unhorsed.
Forced to discard his now-broken shield for the final duel, the blue knight is at a disadvantage and soon disarmed by
Ser Loras. Yet as Loras prepares the final blow, the blue knight charges into it, grapples him to the ground, and
opens Tyrell's visor with a dirk to make him to yield.
As the blue knight salutes the king in victory, squires rush to help Loras Tyrell remove his helm and Catelyn is
startled by his youth and beauty. Renly then bids the champion to approach and there are a few cries of "Tarth!" and,
oddly, "A Beauty!" but most remain silent. Renly declares the blue knight to be all his father claimed since Loras is
rarely unhorsed, but Catelyn overhears accusations of trickery from the crowd. When she asks why the man in blue
is so disliked, Ser Colen explains that the champion is no man but 
Brienne of Tarth
, the daughter of Lord 
Selwyn the
Evenstar
, who is often called "Brienne the Beauty," though never to her face.
King Renly officially declares Brienne the champion as the last mounted of 116 knights and offers her any reward
within his power. Brienne asks to be made one of his seven 
Rainbow Guard
 and Renly agrees. It is only when
Brienne removes her greathelm that Catelyn understands Ser Colen's words: the only thing beautiful about Brienne
are her girlish blue eyes. Her face is broad, coarse, and freckled, with a large mouth full of crooked teeth and a nose
that has been broken more than once. Catelyn is filled with pity for the girl, yet Brienne looks anything but
unfortunate when Renly fastens the rainbow cloak to her shoulders, and her face lights up with a smile as she
proudly pledges to give her life for him.
Ser Colen interjects to introduce Catelyn, though she needs to insist that Robb is King in the North as well as Lord
of Winterfell. Renly looks surprised, but greets her warmly and introduces his queen, who offers condolences for her
husband's death. Renly even swears to bring her 
Cersei Lannister
's head when he takes 
King's Landing
, but Catelyn
replies that justice will be enough. Brienne of Tarth notes that Catelyn should kneel and refer to the king as "Your
Grace," but Catelyn insists they have more pressing matters to discuss. Some of Renly's lords bristle, but the king
only laughs and asks when Robb plans to march on Harrenhal. Unsure whether Renly will be a friend or a foe,
Catelyn only replies that she does not sit on the war council. Renly asks about 
Jaime Lannister
 and, learning he is a
prisoner, declares that the direwolf is gentler than the lion. Lord Randyll Tarly pipes up that Robb should have come
to pay homage in person, but Catelyn counters that her son is fighting a war, not playing at one. Renly grins and
warns Lord Tarly that he is outmatched, then offers Catelyn the use of his own pavilion (since he is guesting at Lord
Lorent Caswell
's castle) and invites her to the evening's farewell feast.
Renly's pavilion is so massive and richly furnished that Catelyn understands why his host moves so slowly, and that
evening she is seated between Mathis Rowan and Ser 
Jon Fossoway
. Meanwhile, Brienne of Tarth is seated at the
far end of the high table in knight's garments instead of a lady's and Catelyn notes that out of her armor Brienne
looks muscular, plain, and ungainly, and judges from the woman's actions that she knows it.
Singers and tumblers entertain them, and the food is rich and plentiful, but Catelyn eats only sparingly and watches
those around her. King Renly speaks amiably to all and sometimes feeds Queen Margaery choice morsels or kisses
her lightly, but it is Ser Loras who shares most in his jests and confidences. Others are less moderate: the brothers
Josua
 and 
Elyas Willum
 dispute who will be first over the walls of King's Landing, Lord 
Varner
 dandles a serving
girl, Ser 
Guyard Morrigen
 sings a bad song about knotting lions' tails, Ser 
Mark Mullendore
 feeds his pet 
monkey
from his plate, and Ser 
Tanton Fossoway
 climbs onto the table and swears to slay 
Sandor Clegane
 in single combat.
When a gold-dressed fool and a dwarf elicit gales of laughter by mocking Jaime and 
Tyrion Lannister
, Lord Rowan
remarks to Catelyn that Renly and his favorites are all very young. Seeing Lord 
Bryce Caron
 goad Ser 
Robar Royce
into juggling daggers, Catelyn recalls that none of them are old enough to have seen war, so they think it is a game
and believe themselves immortal. She tells Lord Rowan that war will make them old, as it did her generation, and
says she pities them because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming. Brienne chimes in to disagree,
saying:
Winter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it’s always
summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.

Catelyn knows that winter comes for everyone, as it did for her when Ned died, but King Renly saves her from
having to say so by asking her to take the air with him. Brienne wants to come along as well, but Renly insists
another sword will make no difference in the midst of his own army. Brienne seems very hurt by the refusal.
As they walk, Renly asks if Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 has joined Robb at Riverrun. When Catelyn seems puzzled, Renly
tells her of Selmy's dismissal and his vow to serve the true king, adding that Brienne's position in the Rainbow
Guard was meant for Selmy. Next, Renly explains that he offered Ned a hundred swords to seize Joffrey but fled
when refused because he lacked the strength to act alone and feared Cersei meant to kill him after Robert died. He
adds that he liked Ned well enough and knew him to be Robert's loyal friend, but says Ned would not listen or bend.
Leading her out onto the roof, Renly shows Catelyn his army's countless campfires and asks how many fires burn
around Riverrun. He guesses that Robb has 40,000 men at most, though Catelyn knows the real number is much
lower. Renly declares that he has twice as many with him, and another 10,000 with 
Mace Tyrell
 at Highgarden, a
strong garrison at 
Storm's End
, and soon all the power of 
Dorne
 and his brother 
Stannis Baratheon
 on 
Dragonstone
.
Catelyn counters sharply that Renly seems to have forgotten that Stannis has the better claim. Renly replies that
Stannis is respected and feared but not loved and would make an appalling king. Gesturing to his army, Renly
declares that his claim is as good as Robert's ever was.
Then he offers terms: Robb can rule in Winterfell and even go on calling himself King in the North, but he must
bend the knee to Renly as his overlord. When Catelyn asks the consequences of refusal, Renly insists he means to be
king of a united realm and reminds her that 
Torrhen Stark
 was wise to yield to 
Aegon I Targaryen
, adding that if
they join together the war is good as done.
Just then, a messenger rides into the yard with news that 
Storm's End
 is under attack, although Ser 
Cortnay Penrose
defies the besiegers. When Renly protests that he would know if Lord Tywin had left Harrenhal, the messenger
replies that these are no Lannisters; it Lord Stannis at the gates, calling himself 
King
 Stannis.

Jon IV
The 
Night's Watch
 finally finds people at 
Craster's Keep
. 
Craster
 has been an ally to the Watch, but he has an
unsavory reputation. 
Jon Snow
 discovers that Craster marries his daughters and gives his young sons to the Cold
Gods. Jon gets the opportunity to talk to one of Craster’s wives, 
Gilly
, about this, and learns that the Cold Gods have
bright blue eyes like the 
wights
 that attacked 
Jeor Mormont
. The next day, Jon rides with the Lord Commander,
telling him about Craster’s sons and daughters, and learns that the commander knew. Then the commander tells him
that Craster informed them that 
Mance Rayder
 is gathering his people at 
Frostfangs
.
Synopsis
Jon Snow
 is riding beside a grumpy 
Lord Commander
 with an equally soaked and grumpy raven on his shoulder.
There have been six days of rain, and the ground is treacherous; Jon thinks about 
Pypar
 and 
Todder
 sitting near the
fire in the common room. The Lord Commander is relieved when he hears 
Jarmen Buckwell
’s horn—it means there
are still people at 
Craster's Keep
. They have so far passed through seven villages without seeing anybody. Jon has
heard many tales about 
Craster
. 
Thoren Smallwood
 swears he is a friend of the watch, though he has an unsavory
reputation: 
Dywen
 says he is a kinslayer, liar, raper, craven, and slaver. The Lord Commander tells Jon to spread the
word down the column that he wants no trouble with Craster’s women, and the men will mind their hands and avoid
talking to the women.
As he rides down the line, he finally comes to 
Sam
 with the baggage. The ravens are very unruly, and Sam explains
that they hate the rain like men. Sam states he is doing alright, but wet, and when he is told that Craster’s Keep is
just ahead, he tells Jon that 
Eddison Tollett
 says Craster marries his daughters, only follows his own laws, and that
Dywen told 
Grenn
 he has black blood. Also, that his mother is 
a wilding
 that laid with a ranger. Sam almost goes on
to call Craster a bastard, but Jon finishes for him, and says he has heard the word before. Jon finally makes it to the
rear to give word to Ser 
Ottyn Wythers
, who considers it welcome news; he has always looked tired, but the rain has
made him look much worse.
On the way back up the column, Jon cuts through the woods. When he hears rustling, he thinks it is 
Ghost
, but it is
Dywen and Grenn. Jon gives them the news that Craster is alive, and discussion turns to how many wives he has.
Then Ghost is loping beside Jon’s horse. Jon rides ahead to the keep.
When he gets to the keep, he is very disappointed. He did not expect a stone castle, but what he finds, he would call
a midden heap. Inside the compound he sees a little naked girl pulling carrots, and two women tie a pig for
slaughter. He can hear 
Chett
’s hounds' barking being answered by the bark of Craster’s dogs. Some of the dogs
break off when they see Ghost, while others growl and Ghost ignores them. Jon estimates that only 30 or maybe 50
will get to sleep in the hall, but not their 200. Dolorous Edd has been entrusted with the commander’s mount and
tells Jon that he is to join the commander in the hall, but the wolf should stay outside.
Inside the squalid, foul smelling hall, there are already two dozen rangers, including Jarman Buckwell and Thoren
Smallwood. Jon thinks how he looked forward to seeing the wonders beyond the wall—it is a pity Pypar and Todder
are missing this. Craster is the only one sitting in a chair, even the commander has to sit on a bench, and seeing him
Jon thinks of Old 
Nan
’s tales of wildlings drinking blood from human skulls. He overhears Craster say he has not
seen 
Brandon Stark
 for three years. In the background, shabbily dressed women prepare the food and pass out beer

while a dozen puppies and a pig skulk around. Mormont tells Crater that Ben was searching for the vanished Ser
Waymar Royce
, 
Gared
 and 
Will
. Craster recalls the three men, but does not know where they went. He does
complain that his wives made cow eyes at young Ser Waymar who was too proud to sleep under his roof. The
commander tells him about the villages they found abandoned, and the 
wights
 that attacked him at 
Castle Black
.
Craster feigns ignorance, but one of his wives recognizes the truth in the tale by the look of horror on her face.
Craster also refuses the offer of an escort back to 
the Wall
, saying he is of the free folk. He even has his wife
confirm that this is their place, Craster keeps them safe, and it is better to die free. Jarmen Buckwell asks about
Craster’s king, 
Mance Rayder
, and Craster states that Free Folk have no need of kings, and that when one of
Mance’s men arrived to tell him he had to leave his keep and grovel at Mance’s feet, he sent the man back without
his tongue.
Craster then tells the commander that they can sleep on the floor, but he will only feed 20. Mormont responds that
the roof would be welcome, and they have food and wine which they will share. Craster expresses particular interest
in the wine and then adds that any man that lays a hand on one of his wives loses his hand. Mormont agrees, but
does not look pleased. Craster now asks if Mormont has a man that can draw maps, and Jon steps forward stating
that Sam likes maps. Mormont tells Jon to get Sam with quill and parchment and bring Mormont’s axe as a guest
gift. Craster notes that Jon Snow has the look of a Stark, and is told that he is Mormont’s steward and squire. When
Craster hears the name Snow, he understands that Jon is a bastard, and declares that a man who wants to bed a
woman should marry her like he does, and then tells Jon to do his service.
Jon almost collides into Ottyn Wythers as he is leaving. Outside he finds tents have gone up all over the compound.
He finds Dolorous Edd and tells him of the requests. Edd states that the commander will get his axe back, buried in
his skull. When he hears that the commander wants wine as well, he says that Craster, drunk, will only cut off an ear
when he attempts to slay them. When Jon tells Dolorous Edd that Smallwood says Craster is their friend, he
responds the difference between wildling friends and enemies is that the friends bury them in secret graves.
Jon hears a shout of fear as he finishes up feeding the horses. He finds Ghost with two rabbits confronting a 15 year
old girl. Jon promises that Ghost will not hurt her. He asks her if she is one of Craster’s daughters and is told she is
now his wife. She was hoping to breed the rabbits. Jon can tell that Ghost has gone after the caged rabbits; he must
have been hungry. He would pay for them but has no money, so he tells her that the 
Night's Watch
 will make good.
She calls him lord and he responds he is no lord. Then ranger 
Lark
 the Sisterman tells her that he is Lord Snow
himself, and then notes that the wolf is looking hungry. Jon tells Lark that he is scaring her, only to have Chett
respond that Lark is warning her. The girl then remembers she is not to talk to them. Chett tells Jon that he would
not be so bold without Ghost around; Chett lost is position as Maester 
Aemon
's steward because of Jon. When Lark
joins in about Jon being a coward without his wolf, he leaves.
It takes a while for Jon to find Sam, and it is actually Ghost that finds him under a rock outcrop. Ghost has given Jon
the second rabbit, and Jon shows Sam and then informs him that the commander wants him to create a map. Jon
proceeds to cook the scrawny rabbit over a fire. It smells wonderful and the other rangers give them envious looks.
As they eat, Sam asks if Craster is a savage, as they say. After Sam leaves with the quill and parchment, Jon falls
asleep thinking that maybe the commander will learn something that will lead them to Uncle Benjen.
He wakes to dawn, and Ghost is gone. Everything is coated in a fine ice glaze, and Jon thinks of his sisters, and that
Sansa would call this enchantment. He hears his name called and finds the girl with the rabbits wearing Sam’s cloak.
She asks him if he is the king’s brother, and he tells her he is his half-brother. Jon is concerned about Craster, but
Gilly
 tells him her father drank too much and will sleep most of the day. She then asks him about King’s justice; she
wants to leave. Craster should not even notice since he has 19 wives. She explains that she is pregnant, and while it
will not be too bad if she has a girl, since Craster will let her grow up and marry her, if it is boy, he will give it to the
gods. Nella has told her that the baby will be male, and Gilly believes she knows these things, having had six boys.
She continues by telling Jon that when the white cold comes, he sacrifices the boys, and it has been coming more
often, so he has had to give the sheep, which are now gone. Next it will be the dogs. The Cold Gods come at night,
and are white shadows. Jon thinks about the two wights, asks the color of their eyes and is told they are bright blue.
She tells him that she knows he did not take of Craster’s hospitality, so Jon is not bound to Craster, and asks to be
taken to the Wall, but Jon tells her that they are going the other direction, and that it is for the old crow to decide, not
him. Disappointed, she leaves.
He joins Dywen, Grenn and Hake for breakfast. Dywen claims he had three of the woman that night. He is not

believed. Jon asks if Sam slept in the hall, and is told that it was impossible to sleep with the hard ground, the ill-
smelling rushes, and the snoring, particularly the snoring of 
Brown Bernarr
. Jon soon excuses himself to attend to
the Lord Commander.
On the way, he passes by the scouts, and Jarman Buckwell tells him to keep a good edge on his sword since they
will be needing it soon enough. When he enters the hall, the commander’s Raven announces his presence with a
request for corn. When the commander asks, Jon tells him the rain has stopped but it is cold. Mormont tells him to
saddle his horse for he plans to leave within the hour. He tells Jon that there is some food, but Jon declines, deciding
he will not take of Craster’s hospitality.
He finds Sam behind the hall with Gilly. She quietly leaves and Sam tells Jon he was hoping he could do something
for Gilly. Jon asks what he could have done, wrap her in a cloak and take her with them? Sam admits Jon is right,
but she is afraid, and maybe when they come back they can take her. Jon states the commander will not let them take
one of Craster’s wives, then quickly excuses himself because he has to groom and saddle the horses.
As he rides alongside Mormont, Jon notes that Craster has no sons or sheep. Mormont admits that Craster gives his
sons to the wood, and tells Jon that all the rangers know, but will not talk of it. If he could have, Mormont states, he
would have taken the boys, they could raise them to the black, but the wildlings serve crueler gods. Mormont then
asks if Jon spoke to one of Craster’s wives, and Jon admits he did. Then Mormont tells Jon that if he had his way,
with Craster sprawled out drunk and the new axe below, one of the wives could easily kill him. However, the Night's
Watch need Craster, and his keep has been responsible for saving many ranger lives. Mormont can tell Jon wants to
say something, and tells him to. Jon states that his father said that a brutal or unjust bannerman shames his liege
lord. Mormont responds that Craster is his own man and has sworn no vows.
After Jon informs Mormont that Buckwell has told him he would soon need his sword, Mormont explains that
Craster told them Mance Rayder is gathering his people at 
Frostfangs
, a cruel, inhospitable wilderness of stone and
ice. Mormont expects Mance to invade the realm. Jon mentions that 
Raymun Redbeard
 in the time of his
grandfather's grandfather, and before that 
Bael the Bard
, invaded the realm. Mormont admits this, adding more
names including 
Joramun
, who blew the Horn of Winter to wake the giants, but not only is the Watch a shadow of
itself, Winterfell is weak with 
Robb Stark
 marching south. This is a great opportunity for the wildlings. Their only
choice is to find Mance Rayder and stop him.

Theon Greyjoy
 meets an 
ironborn
 woman calling herself Esgred while admiring his 
new longship
. Immediately
taken by her, Theon responds to her flirtations, eventually offering her a ride to 
his father's
 
castle
. They continue to
flirt on route to 
Pyke
, but upon their arrival, Theon discovers that Esgred is actually his older sister, 
Asha
. At the
feast held by Lord 
Balon Greyjoy
 that evening, Asha sits in the seat to Balon's right, a place of high honor. Theon
and Asha later join their father and two uncles, 
Victarion
 and 
Aeron
, in Balon's solar, where Balon reveals his plans.
Theon is furious to discover that he has been given the least important mission.
Synopsis
Theon Greyjoy is at the docks at 
Lordsport
, admiring his 
new longship
. He is approached by a striking ironborn
woman calling herself Esgred. Theon is taken by her and immediately begins to flirt. Although she responds to
Theon's flirtations, Esgred informs him that she is married and pregnant. Theon is not bothered by this, telling her
that he cannot father a 
bastard
 on her if she is pregnant and attempting to sway her by informing her he is a prince.
When he asks whether he should name his ship after her, Esgred tells him that he should, as she has she build his
ship. She informs him she is the daughter of 
Ambrode
 and the wife of 
Sigrin
, the shipwright. When Theon claims
she is wasted on Sigrin, she in turn claims that, according to Sigrin, the ship is wasted on Theon. She asks what
Theon thinks of his new ship, but when Theon calls the ship a "fair maiden", Esgred states she is a sea bitch. Theon
declares 
Sea Bitch
 to be the name of his new ship, which will be blessed by his uncle 
Aeron
, a priest of the 
Drowned
God
, the next day.
They flirt some more, but Esgred continues to refuse to sleep with him. She does accept Theon's invitation to a feast
held by Lord 
Balon Greyjoy
 at Pyke that evening. Together, they walk through 
Lordsport
, crowded with the men of
the newly arrived Lord 
Gorold Goodbrother
 of 
Great Wyk
, to the 
inn
 to find Theon's horse and squire. Theon is glad
to notice that the people grow quiet as they pass and acknowledge them with bows, considering it a sign of respect
to him. On their way to the inn, Esgred inquires whether Theon has already assembled a crew. When Esgred calls
out to several men she is familiar with, Theon comes to realize that he has been away from Pyke for a long time and
that any friends he once had are now strangers to him. He tells Esgred that his uncle 
Victarion
 has loaned him his
steersman, 
Rymolf Stormdrunk
. As they pass the 
Myraham
, which has not yet been allowed to leave by Lord Balon,
the 
captain's daughter
 on board calls out to Theon, who admits to Esgred that he has slept with her.
At the inn Theon finds his squire, 
Wex Pyke
, whom he orders to saddle his warhorse 
Smiler
, which he had
purchased from Lord 
Sawane Botley
. Esgred is impressed by Theon's horse and rides double with Theon to Pyke,
sitting in front of him. During the ride, he frequently attempts to fondle her breasts, but she removes his hands each
time. When she asks Lord Balon will welcome her, Theon tells her that he himself had hardly been welcomed.
Esgred questions Theon’s status as heir as he has brothers, uncles, and his sister. He tells her that his brothers are
dead and that he’ll find a husband for his sister 
Asha
. His uncles, however, are a sore point. Although his own claim
is stronger, it is not unheard of on the 
Iron Islands
 for an uncle to dispose of a weak nephew. Theon claims Aeron
only cares for the Drowned God, Victarion is tireless and dutiful, and Euron is most likely dead, having been gone
from the islands for two years. Esgred admits that Euron may be dead and that if he is alive he would be half a
stranger, which would make it unlikely that the ironborn would seat him on the 
Seastone Chair
. Theon is bothered
by the thought, as his absence of ten years has made him more of a stranger than Euron. Regardless, he is
determined to prove himself worthy.

During the remainder of the journey they speak of the feast, 
Theon's mother
, who resides at 
Harlaw
, and Esgred's
pregnancy. She eventually asks about 
Robb Stark
 and his war against the 
Lannisters
, and Theon tells her about the
battles they have fought. As they arrive at Pyke, however, Theon discovers to his horror that Esgred is actually Asha
when the stableboy addresses her by her name. Asha reveals she arrived with Lord Goodbrother the night before and
had stayed a night at the inn. As Theon gapes at her, she tells him that kept silent about her identity because she
wanted to see who he was first. Asha leaves and Theon takes his anger out on Wex, who is smirking at him. Theon
retreats to his chambers, angry, thinking how Asha made a fool of him and how he has no place at Pyke because of
her. When he hears the distant music he dresses for Balon's feast, deciding to wear only plain clothes while cursing
the fact that he has no ornaments "bought with iron".
At the hall Lord Balon is feasting near four hundred lords and captains. All the houses of the Iron Islands are present
except for 
House Stonehouse
 and 
House Drumm
, who have yet to arrive. At the dais, Balon comments that Theon is
late. Theon sits down next to Asha, who is siting at Balon's right in a place of high honor. When Theon hisses to her
that she is in his seat, she replies that his place is at 
Winterfell
 and asks where his pretty clothes are. When Theon
asks if every word she told him was a lie, she says not. Calling out to one of the dancers, 
Rolfe
, Asha catches a
flying axe
 and splits Theon’s trencher with it, telling him the axe is her husband. She then pulls a dirk from between
her breasts and tells him it is her suckling babe. Theon realizes the entire hall is laughing at him. As Asha sits back
down, she tells him he should learn about the isles and the people on them, asking him why they should die for
Theon if he does not know them. Theon insists he is their prince, but Asha counters that the ironborn do not follow
the laws of the green lands, but rather make their own.
Finally Lord Balon rises, telling them to join him in his solar when they are finished. After arguing with Asha,
Theon leaves and crosses the rope bridge to the 
Sea Tower
, where he finds his father and two uncles, Victarion and
Aeron
, in the damp, drafty solar. On seeing him, Balon tells him it is time he heard his plans, refusing to hear any of
Theon's suggestions. He tells Theon that he will command eight ships to 
harrying of the Stony Shore
, accompanied
by Aeron and 
Dagmer
. Theon feels slapped, feeling the work is beneath him and that the inclusion of Aeron and
Dagmer indicates that Balon does not trust him. As Asha slips in, Balon tells them that she will take thirty ships with
picked men to take 
Deepwood Motte
. Victarion is to make the main thrust at 
Moat Cailin
, sailing up the 
Saltspear
and the 
Fever River
. Once they hold Moat Cailin Robb Stark will not be able to return north. Theon tries to tell
Balon that the lords hold the castles, but again Balon shuts him up, saying the lords have gone south with Robb.
Winterfell may hold out for a year, but the rest shall be theirs.
Theon leaves the solar, but on the rope bridge a sudden gust of wind causes him to stumble to his knees. Asha is
suddenly there and helps him back up, guiding him across the rest of the bridge. She comments he cannot hold his
wine either. Theon tells her he liked her better as Esgred, and she tells him she liked him better when he was nine.

Synopsis
Tyrion
 passes Ser 
Meryn Trant
 as he enters 
Cersei
’s chambers, where he finds the recently knighted Ser 
Lancel
Lannister
 singing to his sister. He complements both, which unnerves Lancel. Tyrion asks Cersei to dismiss Lancel,
as there is an important matter for them to discuss. She immediately thinks it is about the begging brothers that were
incarcerated after claiming the gods are punishing everyone for 
Jaime
 killing the rightful king. Cersei complains that
Ser

Storm's End
 to 
lay
siege
, and 
Renly Baratheon
 is riding to meet him. Tyrion, however, thinks it will end in battle rather than an
agreement, since the brothers are too different, yet alike. They laugh heartily and Cersei is so happy she even hugs
him. He fills two cups with wine, adding some powder to hers. As they toast, Tyrion wonders if this is the Cersei
Jaime sees, and is almost sorry for poisoning her.
The next morning, Cersei is ill, so Tyrion holds audience alone. In the hall, there are both 
Lannister
 guardsmen and
Gold Cloaks
 standing across from each other, with 
Bronn
 and Ser 
Preston Greenfield
 flanking the throne. In
attendance are lovely 
Sansa Stark
, the coughing Lord 
Gyles Rosby
, his cousin 
Tyrek Lannister
 who recently married
young 
Ermesande Hayford
 (he is teased with the nick name “wet nurse”). Ser 
Cleos Frey
 approaches, and Grand
Maester 
Pycelle
 announces that they cannot accept Robb's terms. Tyrion then gives Ser Cleos their own terms:
Robb Stark
 must lay down his sword, swear fealty, and return to 
Winterfell
. He must free my brother
unharmed, and place his host under Jaime’s command, to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis
Baratheon. Each of Stark’s bannermen must send us a son as hostage. A daughter will suffice where there is no
son. They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court, so long as their fathers commit no new
treasons.
When Ser Cleos states that Robb will not agree to these terms, Tyrion continues with:
Tell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock, that soon it will march on him from the west
while my lord father advances from the east. Tell him that he stands alone, without hope of allies. Stannis and
Renly Baratheon war against each other, and the 
Prince of Dorne
 has consented to wed his son 
Trystane
 to the
Princess 
Myrcella
. As to this of my cousins, we offer 
Harrion Karstark
 and Ser 
Wylis Manderly
 for 
Willem
Lannister
, and 
Lord Cerwyn
 and Ser 
Donnel Locke
 for your brother 
Tion
. Tell Stark that two Lannisters are
worth four northmen in any season. His father’s bones he shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey’s good faith.

This raises murmurs of delight and laughter from the audience. Ser Cleos asks about the sword 
Ice
 and Robb's
sisters. Tyrion states that he will have the sword when he makes peace and the sisters when Jaime is released. Tyrion
then tells Vylarr that Ser Cleos is to also have a Lannister escort since he is a cousin, and that Vylarr is to take all of
his guardsmen. This raises concern from Pycelle; Vylarr stands stone still. Tyrion states that the Gold Cloaks and
Kingsguard
 are adequate to protect 
the king
 and queen. 
Varys
 smiles knowingly, 
Littlefinger
 feigns boredom, and
Pycelle is looking confused.
Tyrion attempts to close the meeting, but Ser 
Alliser Thorne
 speaks up complaining about being ignored. Tyrion
feigns ignorance of him being in the city, blaming Bronn for making his friend that he walked 
The Wall
 with wait.
Ser Alliser wants to speak to the king, but is told he is playing with his new crossbow (which Tyrion has just given
him), so Ser Alliser will have to talk with the King’s servants.
Ser Alliser relates how they found the corpses of two long dead rangers, and brought them back to the Wall. They
rose that night and killed Ser 
Jaremy Rykker
 and attempted to murder Ser 
Jeor Mormont
. Tyrion gets assurances that
the Lord Commander survived and they killed these two dead men. Ser Alliser tells them that they were dead the
first time, pale and cold with black hands and feet. As proof he had a hand, but it rotted away while he waited.
Tyrion thinks of the dread he felt when he was on the Wall with 
Jon Snow
. He orders Littlefinger to send Ser Alliser
back with 100 spades to bury the dead and prevent them from walking, and also tells Ser Jacelyn that Ser Alliser
will have the pick of the dungeons to use the spades. Tyrion is informed that the dungeons are near empty since
Yoren
 has already taken all the likely men. He tells Ser Jacelyn to arrest some more, or to spread the word that there
is food at the wall. Ser Alliser is not easily dismissed, trying to warn Tyron of the danger. Ser Preston intervenes,
and Ser Alliser knows better than to challenge a Kingsguard. Then, Bronn marches Ser Alliser from the hall.
Varys compliments Tyrion on how he handled the situation. Littlefinger asks if he meant to send away all his
guards, to which Tyrion responds only his sister’s guards. Tryion notes that Littlefinger is not happy with him, and
Littlefinger replies that he loves him as much as ever but that Myrcella Baratheon cannot wed 
Robert Arryn
 if she
weds Trystane Martell, and to leave him out of the next deception. Glancing at the knife at Littlefinger’s hip, Tyrion
apologizes, stating the realm needs him.
Tyrion asks Varys to walk with him. Varys tells him that Cersei will never let him send away her guard, and Tyrion
replies that Varys is going to help him accomplish this by saying it is part of the plan to free Jaime. Varys is to put
the thief, the poisoner, the mummer, and the murderer in crimson cloaks to join the rest of the guard escorting Ser
Cleos—four among 400 Lannister men cannot be watched closely. She will not like it and be uneasy, but Tyrion
likes her uneasy.
Ser Cleos leaves that afternoon, escorted by 100 Lannister guardsmen. That same afternoon, Tyrion finds 
Timett
dicing in the barracks and tells him to meet him in his solar at midnight. He feasts with the 
Vale mountain clans
 that
night, shunning wine for once. During the feast he asks 
Shagga
 what moon it is and is told black, which they call the
traitor’s moon. He tells Shagga to not get too drunk and to keep his axe sharp.
Shagga uses his axe to destroy the door to Pycelle’s chambers. Tyrion has Timett pull the naked serving girl out of
the bed and march/drag her into the hall. Tyrion pulls the blanket off the maester, who asks why this is being done to
a loyal servant. Tyrion tells him that he sent one of his letters to 
Doran Martell
 and the other to Cersei. Pycelle tries
to blame Varys, but Tyrion informs him that he was the only one he entrusted the information with. Pycelle tries to
claim that something happened to the letter on the way, and that he knows things about Varys that would chill
Tyrion's blood. Tyrion replies that his lady prefers his blood hot. Then, Pycelle tries to accuse Littlefinger, to which
Tyrion responds that he already knows about him. Tyrion instructs Shagga to cut off Pycelle's manhood and feed it
to the goats. When Shagga states there are no goats, Tyrion tells him to make do. Shagga first takes most of
Pycelle’s beard with his axe as Pycelle sprays everything with urine. Pycelle tells Tyrion that he did everything for
House Lannister and to ask 
Tywin
; he says he was even responsible for convincing 
Aerys II Targaryen
 to open the
gates. Tyrion, shocked, states “So the Sack of King’s Landing was your work as well?” He then asks him how many
he has betrayed: Aerys, 
Eddard Stark
, himself, King 
Robert
, 
Jon Arryn
, Prince 
Rhaegar
? Pycelle pleads that Robert
was a wretched king, that 
Renly
 was plotting to bring 
Mace Tyrell
’s 
daughter
 to court and have Cersei supplanted as
Queen. Tyrion asks what Lord Arryn had been plotting, and Pycelle explains that Jon Arryn knew of Cersei’s incest.
Pycelle also knew that Lord Jon planned to send 
his wife
 back to the Eyrie, 
his son
 to foster on 
Dragonstone
, and
that he meant to act on his knowledge. Thanks to Shagga’s axe making closer and closer shaves of Pycelle's neck,
Tyrion finally gets him to confess that he had a hand in the death of 
Jon Arryn
 by assuring he wouldn't receive

effective treatment because he knew about the father of Cersei’s children. He tells them he knew that Cersei wanted
Jon dead but could not say it since Varys was always listening. He sent 
Colemon
 away because he was purging Jon.
Then Pycelle attempts to blame 
Hugh
 for the poisoning, telling Tyrion that Varys can tell him. Disgusted, Tyrion
orders Pycelle thrown into one of the black cells.
When Pycelle is gone, Tyrion searches the quarters and collects a few more small jars, thinking how he wished
Pycelle was the one he could have trusted; Varys and Littlefinger are no more loyal, just more subtle and thus more
dangerous. Tyrion suspects his father's method might be best; send for 
Ilyn Payne
, have all three of their heads
mounted above the gates and be done with it.

Eight days pass before they leave the village. Each day, one of them is tortured by the 
Tickler
 for information about
where valuables and food is hidden (with little result) and the whereabouts of Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
 (for no
information). Finally they are marched to 
Harrenhal
 to serve under 
Tywin Lannister
. 
Arya
, after complaining about
being assigned to the kitchen, is assigned to the understeward in the 
Wailing Tower
, 
Weese
.
Synopsis
Fear has become part of 
Arya
's daily life as she walks the hard, rutted roads among a group of prisoners of 
Gregor
Clegane
 and his men, a kind of fear she had never known until she was held captive in that storehouse at the shore of
the 
Gods Eye
. They spent eight days in the village and are now leaving on Clegane's command, and every day she
has seen someone die.
The Mountain came into the storehouse each morning after breakfast to pick one of them to be interrogated. The
village folk did not dare to look at him, maybe hoping they would escape his attention. But there was no way to hide
from him, no way to be safe. He just chose whomever he liked. There was a girl he picked on the fourth day who
had slept with a soldier three nights running, yet the soldier said nothing. There was an old man he picked on the
fifth day, who had mended their clothing and declared so often that his son served in the 
City Watch
 and did all for
Joffrey
 that the other prisoners had actually started calling him 
All-for-Joffrey
. There was a young mother with a
pox-scarred face who had told Clegane everything she knew on the expectation they would spare her daughter for it,
only to see her daughter be picked the next morning to make certain the mother held nothing back.
The interrogations always went down the same way. They were done in front of the whole group, so that everyone
knew what happened to rebels and traitors. They call the ordinarily looking man who did the questioning 
the
Tickler
. He was assisted by 
Chiswyck
, the old stoop-shouldered man who smashed Arya's head when they caught
her, or by someone else, with Clegane just watching and listening until the prisoners died, which they invariably did.
The questions were always about valuables or food hidden in the village, about the whereabouts of 
Beric Dondarrion
and the size of his band and about who of the villagers had assisted them. They found a few valuables from the
interrogations, but only got wildly inconsistent information about Dondarrion and his men. The longest someone
survived the Tickler's treatment was until evenfall. The bodies were hung by the fires as food for the wolves.
The time in the storehouse has taught Arya that she is no 
Water Dancer
. 
Syrio Forel
 would have never let them
knock him down, take his sword, just watch as 
Lommy Greenhands
 was killed, or sit meekly by in that storehouse
doing nothing while others died. She hates the villagers for being sheep almost as much as she hates herself for
being a lamb, not a direwolf as the sigil of her house suggests. By now the 
Lannisters
 have taken everything from
her: father, friends, home, hope, courage, 
Needle
. They broke her wooden sword in front of her. They have even
taken away her secret of being a girl. She was still able to pee in privacy at the storehouse, yet on the open road that
is not possible, even though she tried to hold it. 
Hot Pie
 gaped at her when she skinned her breeches at a brush in
front of all, but nobody else even looked. Clegane's men didn't care at all.
Their captors have forbidden them to talk and they punish those who disregard the order, as Arya has learned herself
by getting her lip broken. They smashed with a spiked mace the face of a boy who wouldn't stop calling for his
father; then 
Raff the Sweetling
 killed the boy's mother as well when she started screaming. Arya sees no purpose

any longer in being brave, so she watches people die and does nothing. One woman who was questioned tried to be
brave, but she died screaming just as the rest did. There are no brave ones left on this march, only women and
children and very old or very young men. The other men were chained to the gibbet and left as food for wolves and
crows. They only spared 
Gendry
 because he admitted that he had forged his helmet himself, as blacksmiths are too
valuable to be killed.
The Mountain tells them that they will be taken to 
Harrenhal
 to serve Lord 
Tywin Lannister
, a last chance given to
rebels and traitors, which they should take: "Obey, serve, and live." Arya hears people arguing about this when they
go to sleep that night. An old woman laments that what is being done to them isn't just, as they didn't commit any
treason. Dondarrion's me just came and taken everything from them, as Clegane's did. Unlike the Mountain's men,
Dondarrion's did the village folk no harm though, another woman points out, and 
Thoros of Myr
 even paid for what
they took. Only with signed papers, the old woman replies, and those don't lay eggs as the chicken they took from
her used to. Having made sure that no guard is looking, she spits three times for all Lannisters and 
Starks
 and 
Tullys
.
An old man says that the old king would have never stood for this sin and shame. Arya, forgetting herself, asks
whether he is talking about 
King Robert
, but the man meant 
King Aerys
. Then a guard interferes, the old man loses
his two remaining teeth and everyone falls silent.
Besides the prisoners, Clegane's band is also taking pigs, chickens, a cow, and nine wagons of salt fish to Harrenhal.
The Mountain and his men are riding horses, but the captives have to walk and are killed if they cannot keep up or
try to flee. The guards pick women at night and go into the bushes with them, receiving almost no resistance. There
was one girl, prettier than the rest, who had to go with four or five different men each night, until she finally hit one
with a stone one day. Clegane himself beheaded her with his massive two-handed greatsword and made everyone
watch. He commanded that the body was to be left for the wolves. Arya has a side-look at Needle, worn at the hip
by a black-bearded, balding man called 
Polliver
, thinking how good it is that they took the sword from her, as she
would have used it to stab Glegane that moment – and that would likely have ended with her being left as food for
the wolves as well.
Polliver is hardly the worst of the lot, Arya thinks. By now she knows every one of Clegane's men, when they were
only nameless strangers the night she was caught. It's important to keep in mind who of them is lazy or brutal, smart
or stupid. The one they call 
Shitmouth
 has the foulest tongue she ever heard, yet he will give you an extra piece of
bread if you ask, while jolly old Chiswyck or soft-spoken Rafford will only hit you. Arya observes them and listens
to their talk, polishing her hates the way Gendry used to polish his helmet. She hates 
Dunsen
 for wearing Gendry's
helmet, Polliver for taking Needle and Chiswyck for thinking he's funny. She hates even more the people she knows
are responsible for the death of ones close to her: Raff the Sweetling for the death of 
Lommy
, 
Amory Lorch
 for the
death of 
Yoren
, 
Meryn Trant
 for the death of Syrio, 
the Hound
 for the death of 
Mycah
, 
Ilyn Payne
 and Joffrey and
Cersei
 for the death of 
her father
, 
Fat Tom
, 
Desmond
 and the rest, even for the death of 
Lady
, 
Sansa's
 direwolf. The
Tickler is almost too scary to hate, though. There are times Arya almost forgets that he is coming along with the
band, as he is completely inconspicuous when he isn't torturing people, just another soldier and actually quieter than
most of them. Arya has started whispering to herself the names of the people she hates, she does it every night now.
In 
Winterfell
, she used to pray with her father at the 
godswood
 and with 
her mother
 in the 
sept
, but on the road to
Harrenhal, whispering those names has become the only prayer left to her.
Finally the trees give way to a more open landscape of hills, streams and fields – and the occasional burnt holdfast.
After another day's march, they get the first glimpse of the towers of Harrenhal rising hard against the blue of the
lake. Prisoners keep telling each other that things will get better at Harrenhal, but Arya is not sure about this, as she
remembers 
Old Nan's
 stories about this castle built on fear and with mortar 
Black Harren
 mixed with human blood,
but where he was roasted with all his sons by the dragons of 
Aegon the Conqueror
 nonetheless. The castle is only a
few more miles off, Arya thinks, yet they walk almost two more days before they reach Lord Tywin's army,
encamped west of the castle in the scorched remains of a town, the stench from the overflowing latrines greeting
them as they approach, telling Arya that the army has been here for some time. The sheer size of Harrenhal makes it
deceptive to the eyes from afar, yet the gatehouse of the castle alone is as large as the Great Keep of Winterfell.
Arya can only see the tops of the five immense towers from outside. Seeing their grotesque and misshapen form,
looking like an old man's gnarled, knuckly fingers groping for the sky, she now believes every word Old Nan told
about how the stones melted and flowed like candle wax, turning into a searing red as they sought out Harren where
he hid.
Hot Pie does not want to enter the castle, declaring that there are ghosts within. Chiswyck gives him the choice of

joining the ghosts or becoming one, so he walks in with the rest. In the echoing bathhouse, they have to strip and
scrub themselves in tubs filled with scolding hot water, the process supervised by two fierce old women who talk
about them like they are newly aquired donkeys. When they examine Arya, Goodwife 
Amabel
 is dismayed about
her feet while Goodwife 
Harra
 has a closer look at the calluses she received while training with Needle. Harra
believes Arya is a farmer's daughter and got them from churning butter. She tells Arya that she can earn a higher
station in life if she works hard, but will be beaten if she does not. Asked for it, she does not dare to give away her
true name, nor does she want to use Arry. Thus she says Lommy called her Weasel, the name of the first girl that
comes to her mind. Amabel thinks the name is appropriate. She declares that Arya will lose her hair, as it is filled
with lice, and will be assigned to the kitchen. Arya says she'd rather tend the horses, thinking that she could steal one
and escape. Harra slaps her so hard that her lip breaks again and commands her to shut up, as nobody is interested in
her views. Arya thinks that Harra wouldn't dare slap her if she still had Needle. Amabel explains that Lord Tywin
has grooms and squires to look after the horses and that the kitchen would have been a nice place for Arya, as it is
snug and clean and one can always find a warm place to sleep there. However, Arya doesn't seem to be smart, so
they should give her over to 
Weese
, Amabel suggests. They send her off with a rough-spun garb and ill-fitting
shoes.
Weese turns out to be the understeward for the 
Wailing Tower
, a squat man with a carbuncle on the nose and angry
red boils at one corner of his lips. He tells the six assigned to him that the Lannisters are generous to those who
serve them well, a fate none of them deserve. If they do well, they might rise one day as high as he did. However, if
they intend to presume on Lord Tywin's kindness, they'll have to deal with Weese. They are told they are not to look
the highborn in the eye, are only allowed to speak when spoken to and should not get in Lord Tywin's way. Weese
says he can smell defiance, pride and disobedience, and if he does, they'll have to answer for it. All he wants to sniff
of them is fear.

Daenerys III
There is a great celebration in 
Qarth
 for the arrival of 
Daenerys’
 
khalasar
. 
Xaro Xhoan Daxos
 provides her an entire
wing of his palace. After a bath, Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 arrives with a ship captain with news that King 
Robert
Baratheon
 is dead and there is civil war in the 
Seven Kingdoms
.
Synopsis
There is a large celebration for their arrival at 
Qarth
 apparent as 
Daenerys’
 
khalasar
 approaches the city and a
column of camelry rides from the city to provide her an honor guard. The warlock 
Pyat Pree
 told Daenerys that
Qarth is the greatest city, a crossroads, and ancient. Upon seeing the city, Daenerys has to admit the city is
magnificent. It has three thick walls: the first is 30 feet high and made of red sandstone carved with animals, the
second 40 feet high and made of granite carved with scenes of war, and the third 50 feet high, made of black marble
carved with scenes of sex. 
Qartheen
 line the streets and balconies to watch them pass, black 
Drogon
 on her shoulder.
The women are in gowns that bare one breast, and the men wear beaded silk shirts while the children wear only
sandals and paint. Daenerys thinks how the 
Dothraki
 call these people “Milk Men" for their skin and how 
Khal
Drogo
 dreamed sacking the great city.
The merchant prince 
Xaro Xhoan Daxos
 rides up on his camel, which the Dothraki horses shy away from. He tells
Daenerys that if she desires anything she sees it is hers. Pyat Pree sings from her other side “Qarth itself is hers, she
has no need of baubles,” and she should come to the 
House of the Undying
 to drink wisdom and truth. Daenerys
tells them both that she only wants the 
Red Keep
 in 
King's Landing
 and if they want to give her gifts, to give her
ships and swords. Pyat states that it will be as she commands and the other complements her on her wisdom. Xaro
Xhoan Daxos warns her that warlocks are not to be trusted. The two continue to bicker until Ser 
Jorah Mormont
mutters in the common tongue “The crow calls the raven black,” that she should avoid both men, and that it would
be best to not linger here. Daenerys, however, wants their help in winning her throne.
Daenerys expected something grand when Xaro Xhoan Daxos offered the hospitality of his home, but not a palace
larger than a market town, with an entire wing given over to her. He tells her that there will be a feast the next day
with delicacies and music, and the 
Thirteen
 will come to do her honor. Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Pyat depart. The last
of the three seekers, the shadowbinder 
Quaithe
 gives Daenerys a warning to beware of everyone, for they all lust for
the power of her dragons, and then departs.
After Quaithe leaves, Ser Jorah states she is right, but he also does not trust her. Daenerys admits that she does not
understand Quaithe. While the others shower her in promises, she has only cryptic words. It also concerns her that
she has not seen her face. Then Daenerys declares that they will keep their own watch, and will keep a sharp eye on
the dragons. After 
Aggo
 confirms it will be done, she tells 
Rakharo
 to use good men and women to explore the rest
of Qarth since they have only seen the parts that the seekers wanted them to see. She then asks Ser Jorah to go to the
docks to get news of the 
Seven Kingdoms
, and maybe find a ship to carry them home. Ser Jorah tells her the usurper
will kill her and wants to stay with her but she tells him that 
Jhogo
 can guard her, and he has the languages and more
experience with the sea.
After they leave, her handmaidens strip her of her travel stained silks and she bathes in a marble pool with golden
fish. She wonders if the Red Keep has a pool like this with fragrant gardens, remembering 
Viserys
 saying that the

Seven Kingdoms are the most beautiful place in the world. She also thinks she no longer has Drogo’s khalasar
behind her, only her four fierce 
bloodriders
, and that the Dothraki plundered but do not know how to govern. She
ponders Ser Jorah’s words: "The Usurper will kill you." She then thinks about 
Robert Baratheon
, strong as a bull,
fearless in battle and loving war, who killed her brother 
Rhaegar Targaryen
, and his dogs: 
Eddard Stark
, 
Tywin
Lannister
 and 
Jaime Lannister
. How will she overthrow them? Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys, who
was a fool, believed the realm would rise for their rightful king. She then decides that the 
Bleeding Star
 has led her
to Qarth for a purpose, and if the gods intend for her to conquer they will send a sign.
Near eveningfall, 
Irri
 brings word that Ser Jorah has returned. He enters with 
Quhuru Mo
, captain of the 
Cinnamon
Wind
 out of 
Tall Trees Town
. Daenerys has her dragons all around her. He has the news that Robert Baratheon is
dead, reported in 
Oldtown
, 
Dorne
 and 
Lys
. There are tales that 
the queen
, his brother (
Stannis Baratheon
 or 
Renly
Baratheon
, or 
Eddard Stark
 betrayed him. 
Joffrey Baratheon
 sits on the throne with 
House Lannister
 ruling, Robert’s
brothers have fled, and the 
Hand of the King
 has been seized for treason. Jorah does not think it likely that Eddard is
a traitor, saying the long summer will come again before he besmirches his honor. Daenerys wonders if her brother
would have been wiser had he known that vengeance was so close at hand. When asked, the captain replies he is not
returning to 
Westeros
 for a year or more since his ship will sail east from Qarth, making the trader’s circle around
the 
Jade Sea
. When Daenerys states he has brought her a precious gift, he tells her that he has been amply repaid by
being allowed to see dragons. She aks him to come to her one day in 
King's Landing
.
After the trader leaves, Ser Jorah warns Daenerys of speaking so freely. Daenerys replies that the 
Seven Kingdoms
are flying to pieces like the khalasar did after Khal Drogo died. Ser Jorah tells her that she will still need gold,
armies, and ships. Daenerys responds that she knows this, but she is the blood of the dragon. Jorah goes on to say
that King Robert killed a dragon with a warhammer. To this she replies that dragons die, but so do dragon slayers.

Bran
 is with 
Meera
 and 
Jojen
 in the 
godswood
 of 
Winterfell
. Meera tells Bran that Jojen has the 
greensight
 and has
dreams that sometimes come true. Jojen reveals that he has dreamed of the Winged Wolf chained to earth and a
three-eyed crow
 has been unable to free him from the chains. Finally, Bran tells them something of his dreams, and
Jojen keeps pressing. 
Summer
 gets aggressive and attacks as Bran gets angry, but the Reeds manage to climb a tree
to avoid the wolf. Afterwards Bran asks Maester 
Luwin
 about Jojen’s greensight, and is told no man has the
greensight.
Synopsis
Meera
, armed with a three pronged frog spear and a net, is facing 
Summer
 in the 
godswood
. Summer charges past
the spear, but is entangled in the net as he slams into her. 
Bran
 tells her that she loses, but 
Jojen
, whom Old 
Nan
calls “little grandfather” because he is so somber, points out that Summer is entangled in the net. After disentangling
the wolf, and Bran calling to him, she asks if Summer ever grows angry. Bran tells her not with him, and he has
never drawn blood. Meera is still worried, but Bran assures her that he would not have drawn her blood; he knows
and likes her. Bran thinks about how Meera is so like his sister 
Arya
, and tells them that he wishes they were their
wards instead of 
Big Walder
 and 
Little Walder
. They have stayed after all the others have gone, and have become
his constant companions. Bran tells Meera he has never heard of anyone fighting with a net, and asks if their master-
at-arms taught her. She tells him her father taught her, and they have no knights or ravens at 
Greywater Watch
; the
island moves so neither ravens nor enemies can find it. When Bran asks if he would be welcome at Greywater
Watch after the hostilities end, they assure him that 
their lord father
 would welcome him anytime, and that leaving
Winterfell
 sooner rather than later would be good for him.
It is revealed that the 
Bastard of Bolton
 has forcibly taken Lady 
Hornwood
 as his wife after the 
harvest feast
, that
Lord 
Manderly
 took her castle to protect it, and Ser 
Rodrik
 has gone east to settle the uprising and see that justice is
done. Bran could ask Ser Rodrik about visiting the Reeds when he returns.
Meera reveals that Jojen has the 
greensight
; he has dreams of things that have not happened but sometimes do; Jojen
corrects this by saying they always do. Bran asks to hear about the dreams, and is told that Jojen will, but only if
Bran tells them about his own dreams. Bran denies he has dreams, saying that Maester 
Luwin
 gives him sleeping
draughts, which he admits help only sometimes. Meera tells him that everyone in the Castle hears him scream when
he sleeps. Bran does not tell, but is interested in what dreams Jojen has had. Jojen thinks that Bran is 
the Winged
Wolf
 bound to earth by chains. He also states that a crow is trying to peck through the chains, but his beak can only
chip them. When asked if the crow has 3 eyes, Jojen nods.
The crow first came to Jojen when he almost died of greywater fever, and to Bran after he fell. It told him he had to
fly, but when Bran woke, he was broken and couldn’t fly. After hearing this, Jojen is sure that Bran is the Winged
Wolf, and they tell Bran that the 
three-eyed crow
 is not in Greywater Watch, but north, 
beyond the Wall
. When their
father heard Jojen’s dream, he sent them to Winterfell. When Bran asks how he will break the chains he is told to
open his eye, not the two that are opened, but the third one; when he opens his third eye he will be able to see south
to the 
Summer Sea
 and north beyond the Wall.
Bran decides that he is tired of talking of crows, and wants to talk about something else, and then asks about 
lizard-

lions
. However, Jojen keeps asking Bran about his dream, whether he has dreamed he was Summer, and then reveals
that when he touched Summer the night of the harvest feast he felt Bran in Summer, and that he felt Bran fall. He
then asks if falling scares Bran; Bran thinks of 
the golden man
, and that he scares him. He has not been able to tell
Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin, so cannot tell the Reeds either. Jojen continues by asking if he falls every night, and
there is a low rumbling growl from Summer. Meera puts herself between Summer and her brother and asks Bran to
keep the wolf back. Bran claims that Jojen is making Summer angry, but Meera responds that it is him that Jojen is
making angry, his fear. She tells Bran that he and Summer are part of each other. 
Shaggydog
 arrives. The direwolf
lunges and Meera tells Bran to call them off, but he does not know how, and Jojen tells Bran that Summer is
reacting to his anger. Meera tells her brother to climb the tree. Jojen responds that it is not his day to die, but
complies, and Meera follows.
Bran has been unable to call off the wolves, but remembers he is not alone and calls to 
Hodor
. When Hodor appears,
Bran tells him to chase the wolves away, which he gleefully does. When Jojen returns to the ground he never takes
his eyes off Summer as he tells Bran that they will talk again. Bran only thinks that it was the wolves, not him, and
tells Hodor to bring him to Maester Luwin.
When he is with Maester Luwin, he tells him that Meera said her brother has the Greensight. Luwin explains that
their wise men call such people greenseers. He then tells Bran that nobody truly knows what it is, but that the 
First
Men
 thought the greenseers could see through the eyes of the 
weirwood
, which is why the men cut down the trees,
and that they have control over animals and fish. When asked, Bran tells the maester that Jojen only claims to have
dreams that sometimes come true. The maester tells Bran that everyone has dreams that come true, like when he and
Rickon dreamed their 
father
 was in the crypts before they knew he was dead. He then asks Bran whether he
remembers the meaning of the metals of a maester’s chain: black iron for ravenry, silver—healing, gold—sums.
Luwin pulls his chain around his neck to reveal a link made of 
Valyrian steel
 and tells Bran that it signifies the study
of the higher mysteries, magic; this is a study of small use that few maesters trouble with. He goes on to say that
magic may have once been a mighty force but no longer: 
Valyria
 was its last ember, and dragons, the children, and
giants are no more. Jojen does not have the greensight since no living man has that power.
Bran tells Meera what the maester said when she comes to him at dusk, and that Summer should not have tried to
hurt Jojen, but Jojen should not have made the comments about his dreams; the crow lied, and so did Jojen that Bran
could fly. Meera suggests that the maester may be wrong, but Bran replies that he is not and that his father depended
on him. She leaves him with another of Jojen’s dreams, that one day soon Maester Luwin will serve him a king’s cut
off the roast at a great feast, but the portion he gives to the Walders will be grey and dead, yet they will like their
meal better than he.
That night Bran is almost afraid to sit at supper, but everyone is served the same, and there is nothing wrong with
the food served the Walders. Bran is relieved: nothing bad is coming to Winterfell, but he is disappointed also—so
long as there is magic anything can happen. He will never walk, fly or be a knight.

Tyrion VIII
It is late at night when 
Tyrion
 is disturbed by the arrival of 
Lancel
 with demands from 
Cersei
 that 
Pycelle
 be
released and Ser 
Jacelyn Bywater
 be arrested for defying a command in the 
king's
 name. Lancel is arrogant until
Tyrion reveals he knows his part in King 
Robert's
 death and that Lancel has been having sex with the queen. Tyrion
threatens to tell Joffrey, and this convinces Lancel to agree to be Tyrion's spy. Afterwards, Tyrion travels a
circuitous route to be with 
Shae
.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 is informed by a sleepy 
Podrick Payne
 that 
Lancel Lannister
 has arrived. Tyrion is not bothered by the late
hour since he usually works well into the morning reading 
Varys
' whisperers' reports or going over 
Littlefinger's
accounts. He figures, however, that 
Cersei
 was expecting Lancel's late arrival would catch him less alert. Tyrion
takes his time, and roughens his hair to make it look like he has been woken from his sleep.
Tyrion warmly greets Lancel, who has been pacing. Lancel tells him that Cersei commands that 
Pycelle
 be released,
handing Tyrion her warrant. Tyrion tells Lancel he hopes she is not overtaxing herself, he would not want to see a
relapse. After being assured that she is recovered, Tyrion states it is music to his ears, thinking he should have given
her a larger dose. Tryion offers Lancel mulled wine to help him sleep, and he rejects the offer, having not come to
drink. Tyrion states that wine has its dangers and that he would have thought if Cersei was so concerned about
Pycelle she would have come herself. Lancel tells Tyrion just to release the prisoner with a sneer, that the queen is
Joffrey's
 regent. Tyrion replies that he is Joffrey's 
Hand
. Lancel replies “The Hand serves. The regent rules until the
king is of age,” and Tyrion says maybe he should write it down so he can remember, and tells Podrick to leave.
After Pod leaves, Lancel states that Ser 
Jacelyn Bywater
 defied a command in the king's name, and that Cersei
demands he be removed and charged with treason; Tyrion thinks that it means that Cersei has already ordered
Pycelle's release and Bywater rebuffed her. When Lancel threatens Tyrion, Tyrion responds that he will hear no
warning from a boy. Lancel touches his sword and warns Tysrion to watch his words. Tyrion in turn warns him that
at a cry from him, 
Shagga
 will break in and kill Lancel with an axe and not a wineskin. Lancel, incensed, tells
Tyrion that he is a knight. Tyrion asks if Cersei had him knighted before or after she took him to bed. Lancel says
nothing, and Tyrion can tell from his eyes that Varys was right. When Tyrion comments, Lancel demands Tyrion
withdraw his filthy accusations. Before he can finish, Tyrion mentions the result if Joffrey discovers he murdered his
father to bed his mother. Lancel's courage deserts him as he insists to Tyrion that 
Tywin Lannister
 commanded
Lancel to do everything that Cersei told him when he was assigned squire to King 
Robert I Baratheon
. Tryion asks if
Tywin told him to fuck Cersei also, noting that Lancel looks somewhat like 
Jaime
, but a poor copy. Lancel starts to
say he only did has he was bid, to which Tyrion adds that he must have hated every instant of a high place in court,
knighthood, and Cersei opening her legs, and then threatens to go to the king. Lancel begs for mercy as Tyrion
continues his threats to go to the king, whom he is duty bound to inform. When Lancel states he will end it, Tyrion
tells him no, that he will stay close to Cersei, be a spy for him, and tell no one. Lancel agrees, and Tyrion orders him
to drink to their understanding. Tyrion then tells Lancel that he could do well out of this and that knighthood is
nothing. Then he orders him to tell the queen that he begs her forgiveness, and he will let her have Pycelle to do with
however she will, but he will not be on the council. With respect to Ser Jacelyn Bywater, Lancel is to assure the
queen that he thinks he can win him away from Tyrion. Tyrion also notes he does not want another nephew. Lancel
tells him that there is no need for concern since Cersei has him spill his seed on her belly.

After he leaves, Tyrion thinks it fortunate that Lancel's father 
Kevan Lannister
 has two other sons, since in Tyrion's
view, as Cersei will kill Lancel if she finds out he is betraying her, and even if Lancel survives the war, he will never
survive Jaime's return to King's Landing, the only question being whether Jaime kills Lancel in a jealous rage or
Cersei kills him to stop Jaime from finding out. Tyrion privately bets on Cersei.
Tyrion cannot get to sleep, so he sends Podrick, who was asleep, to summon 
Bronn
 and get two horses saddled.
When Bronn arrives, he asks “Who pissed in your soup?” to which Tyrion answers Cersei. He states he should be
used to the taste and that she seems to have mistaken him for 
Eddard Stark
. Bronn replies that he was tall, to which
Tyrion responds not after Joffrey took off his head.
They leave through the postern gate, then down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of 
Aegon's high hill
 onto Pigrun
Alley. Tyrion reflects that the men that have been Hand have been no match for Cersei because they were too
honest. The only way to defeat Cersei is to play her own game. In the crowded brothel, they are met by 
Chataya
,
who leads them to the common room and serves them wine, apologizing for the quality; she cannot find good wine
at any price, which Tyrion understands. As Tyrion waits, 
Dancy
 slides onto his lap, saying she has a cure for him
feeling unloved. He tells her that he has grown fond of 
Alayaya
's remedy. When Alayaya arrives, she leads him up
the stairs, and tells him that Dancy has a bet with 
Marei
, and has only a fortnight before she loses her black pearls.
She leads him to the Tower Room, telling him that she will sleep while he is gone before he disappears down the
shaft to the tunnel.
As he leaves the stables on his gelding, he hears music that reminds him of the words 
Tysha
 sung to him, who was a
lie, a whore Jaime had hired to make him a man.
He arrives at the manse which has been arranged by Varys as a place to sequester 
Shae
. He told Varys he wanted her
protected by ugly, scary men who did not like having sex with women. She is now protected by a 
Braavosi
daggerman
 with a hare lip and a lazy eye, one 
eunuch strangler
, and a pair of foul smelling 
Ibbenese
 who are fond of
axes and each other. If Tyrion had her guarded by his 
clansmen
, it would only be a matter of time before everyone
knew of his concubine.
He enters the room not intending to disturb Shae, but the sight of her nude body makes him hard. He spreads her
legs and starts to lick her until his beard is soaked and then enters her, and explodes almost at once. She opens her
eyes and tells him she just had the sweetest dream.
Tyrion thinks of the wars and intrigues and that he was made for this.

Arya
 is working for the understeward of the 
Wailing Tower
 doing various chores. When the Ser 
Amory Lorch
arrives, 
Jaqen H'ghar
, 
Rorge
 and 
Biter
 are with him. Arya thinks that Jaqen has not seen her, but he interrupts her
sleep that night to tell her he will kill three men for her for saving him and his two companions. She avoids Jaqen for
a while, but after hearing a story by 
Chiswyck
, she whispers Chiswyck’s name in Jaqen's ear. Several days later he
falls to his death.
Synopsis
Arya
 wonders what King 
Harren Hoare
 meant to name the five towers of 
Harrenhal
, but they are now known as the
Tower of Dread
, the 
Widow's Tower
, the 
Wailing Tower
, the 
Tower of Ghosts
, and 
Kingspyre Tower
 since the
burning of Harrenhal
. She now sleeps in a niche in the vaults beneath the Wailing Tower. The work is hard, but no
harder than the miles she was walking every day, and she can wash and the food is filling; she does not need to find
bugs to eat. 
Hot Pie
 is assigned to the kitchens, and 
Gendry
 to the forge, while Arya works for the understeward
Weese
 doing errands; running messages, drawing water, fetching food, and sometimes serving tables in the barracks
hall. Arya hates 
Weese
 and adds him to her list of names. She occasionally gets to see Hot Pie when she is sent to
fetch the food for Weese and his charges; Arya does not want to learn the names of Weese’s other charges since it
hurts when people she knows die.
Lady 
Shella Whent
 only occupied parts of two towers, letting the rest of the castle go to ruin. She left a small staff
when she fled, inadequate for the host that now occupies the castle. As a result, the 
Lannisters
 have to forage for
servants to make more of Harrenhal habitable. Harrenhal covers three times the area of 
Winterfell
, but its buildings
are much grander: the stables handle 1000 horses, the 
Godswood
 covers 20 acres, the kitchen is as large as
Winterfell’s Great Hall, and the Hall of the Hundred Hearths could handle Tywin’s entire host.
Some claim the ghosts of 
Harren the Black
 and his sons occupy the Wailing Tower, but Arya knows that they died
in the Kingspyre Tower; the wailing is from the wind, and the ghosts never trouble her. However she fears living
men, including Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 and 
Tywin Lannister
, who keep their apartments in the Kingspyre Tower. She
considers marching up to Tywin and telling him who she is, but figures she would never get close enough to him,
and if she did, he would not believe her, and she would get a beating form Weese, whom she fears more than the
Mountain; he hits at the slightest provocation. On the road to Harrenhal, she felt like a sheep, but now she feels like
a mouse.
The lords and ladies never notice the grey mice under their feet, and Arya hears many secrets by just listening as she
does her duties. The 'slut' Pretty 
Pia
 is working her way through every knight, the wife of the gaoler is pregnant
either by Ser 
Alyn Stackspear
 or a singer 
Whitesmile
, Lord 
Leo Lefford
 keeps a candle lit by his bed because of the
ghosts, Ser 
Dunaver
’s squire 
Jodge
 cannot hold his water at night, the cooks spit on the despised Ser 
Harys Swyft
’s
food, and Maester 
Tothmure
’s serving girl told her brother that Tywin has ordered the maester to burn a message
claiming that Joffrey is a bastard, and to never speak of it again. She also hears from Weese that 
Stannis Baratheon
and 
Renly Baratheon
 are both kings and have joined the fighting. Many of the Lannister men question how long
Joffrey can hold the throne, protected only by 
Gold Cloaks
 and ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf and a woman. There have
also been a number of reports of 
Beric Dondarrion
 being killed by the 
Bloody Mummers
, but he has already
supposedly been killed by 
Amory Lorch
 at 
Rushing Falls
, and twice by the Mountain.

A fortnight later, the queerest collection of men Arya has ever seen arrives, the Bloody Mummers. Weese assures
her that she does not want to know them, and is told they are called The Footmen, Toes of the Goat, and Lord
Tywin’s Bloody Mummers. They call themselves the Brave Companions and their leader is the very tall, stick thin
Vargo Hoat
. They are housed in the Widow’s Tower, for which Arya is thankful. On their first night, Ser 
Harys
Swyft
’s squire is killed and two of the Bloody Mummers are wounded. Tywin hangs both along with one of Lord
Lewys Lydden
’s archers who is supposed to have started the trouble. They do not stay long, but before they leave
she hears that 
Roose Bolton
 has occupied the 
Ruby Ford
 and her brother is in 
Riverrun
, which is much closer than
Winterfell but she does not know where it lies in relation to Harrenhal; if only she could get away.
She learns that there are captives from the 
Battle of the Green Fork
. They have been given freedom of the castle in
return for a pledge that they will not attempt to escape, but Arya is hoping they can help her escape. There are three
Frey brothers and their bastard brother, but they are soon ransomed. There is also a very fat lordling who is always
in the kitchen, one that wears a black cloak with white suns, and Lord 
Medger Cerwyn
, whom she recognizes. She
figures she can get aid from Lord Cerwyn, but learns later that he died from his wounds.
Arya hears all sorts of rumors about Lord Tywin’s plans. Lord Tywin spends his days with his war council. Arya
often catches sight of him, and thinks he is strong looking for an old man, and his face reminds her of her father,
although they look nothing alike, and she could never picture Tywin laughing.
Ser 
Amory Lorch
 arrives one afternoon, looking less frightening in the daylight. He has fewer men than she
remembers and many wounded. She is told that they rode all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and
slaying rebels. Arya figures they are talking about the men of the 
Night's Watch
. At the end of the column she sees
Jaqen H'ghar
, 
Rorge
 and 
Biter
 with his body covered in half-healed wounds. Jaqen H’ghar still smiles, and his
clothes are filthy, but his hair washed and brushed. His eyes pass right over Arya, and she thinks he did not even
notice her. Arya thinks that Gendry was right and she should have let them die. That night, she says the names
again: 
Weese
, 
Dunsen
, 
Chiswyck
, 
Polliver
, 
Raff
 the Sweetling, the 
Tickler
, 
the Hound
, Ser 
Gregor
, Ser 
Amory
Lorch
, Ser 
Ilyn
, Ser 
Meryn
, and King 
Joffrey
 and 
Queen Cersei
. She thinks she might add three names to the list,
but she is too tired to decide.
She is dreaming of wolves in the wild when she wakes with Jaqen H’ghar’s hand over her mouth. He notes that the
boy Arry became a girl and revealing that he did see her that afternoon. He then explains that she saved three lives,
thus he has to repay her by taking three lives of her choice, in order to appease the 
Red God
. When Arya asks him to
take her to Riverrun, he replies that he will take three lives for her, nothing more, and gives her some time to decide
whom to kill. Then, he leaves before she can even light her candle.
The next morning, Arya yawns in Weese’s presence, and he warns her not to let her mouth drop open again, telling
her he will feed her tongue to his bitch, and twists her ear to make certain she heard. As she works, she thinks of
whom she wants dead, and that, being at war, she should try to kill as many Lannisters as she could, but her father
personally killed those he condemned to death. She is not sure she should trust Jaqen, and avoids him for a while,
which is not hard to do.
Ser Gregor returns, and Weese sends Arya to see if they have clothes that need mending. She arrives to find
Chiswyck talking, and does not want to interrupt because she might be hit. He is talking about when he was
returning from the 
Tourney of the Hand
 with Ser Gregor, Raff, 
Joss Stilwood
, and 
Eggon
. They stopped at an
alehouse where the brewer did not stop talking. They knew better than to talk because the Mountain was seething
over the joust with the 
Knight of Flowers
. The brewer’s girl was serving, and they were touching her. Finally, Joss
put his hand up her skirt, and she screamed, running to the kitchen. The brewer went to Ser Gregor and asked that
his men leave the girl alone. Ser Gregor had the girl brought before him, payed the brewer a silver, and raped her
right there.Her brother ran in from the cellar and Raff stabbed him with a dirk. After Ser Gregor was done, 
Tobbot
and Chiswyck continued to rape her. Ser Gregor told the brewer the girl was not worth a silver, and demanded
change, and the brewer gave it to him. They all roar with laughter at the story while Arya sneaks away. When Weese
learns she did not ask about the mending, he beats her bloody.
Two days later she sees Jaqen H’ghar in the Barracks Hall. Ensuring that Weese is not around, she works her way
down to him filling wine cups until she reaches him and whispers “Chiswyck” in his ear. He gives no sign that he
heard, and nothing happens until the third day, when she hears that a man fell off the wallwalk the previous night.
Some are saying Harren’s ghost flung him down and Arya thinks that she is the ghost in Harrenhal and there is one

less name on her list.

 in hopes of bringing the brothers to reason. She fails
and learns that Stannis has sent a letter claiming that neither 
Joffery
 nor 
Tommen
 are 
Robert Baratheon
’s sons. Even
though there is no proof, she remembers that 
Lysa
 claimed that 
Cersei
 killed her husband. Catelyn asks Renly’s
leave but is not given it—he wants her to see him victorious in the morning.
Synopsis
Hallis Mollen
 announces to 
Catelyn
 that they are the first to arrive at an area where the trees have been cut down by
Stannis Baratheon
’s foragers to build siege equipment. Ser 
Wendel Manderly
 tells Catelyn that this is not their fight
and Catelyn replies that she was sent here by 
Robb Stark
 and for the good of the realm it must be done, but forging a
peace between the brothers will not be easy; she would prefer to be with her dying father 
Hoster Tully
 in 
Riverrun
 or
back in 
Winterfell
. In the distance she can see 
Storm's End
 and Stannis’ army looking small and insignificant under
its walls.
Catelyn thinks about the history of Storm’s End and of the love between the first Storm King, 
Durran
, and 
Elenei
,
the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. After the wedding, Elenei yielded her maidenhood and
immortality. Her parents unleashed storm and wind to destroy Durran’s hold, killing all but Durran and his wife,
who had protected him within her arms. It was the seventh castle he built that managed to withstand the storms. It is
said that this castle was built with the help of the 
children of the forest
 or a child that became known as 
Brandon the
Builder
.
Stannis is the first to arrive with a 
Red Priestess
 as his standard bearer; Catelyn knows that 
Renly
 will be last.
Stannis expresses his surprise to find her here, and gives his condolences for her husband 
Eddard Stark
, though he
notes Stark was no friend of his. Stannis is not grateful for Eddard’s part in breaking the siege, saying it was on
Robert Baratheon
’s command. He holds it against Eddard that he took the position of 
Hand of the King
, which he
did not even want. Stannis tells her that regardless of his feelings for her husband, Catelyn will have justice for his
murder; she responds that Renly promised the same, but she would prefer her daughters back. Stannis promises that
her daughters will be found when he takes King's Landing. Catelyn thinks his tone implies dead or alive, and tells
him that King’s Landing is closer to 
Dragonstone
, but he is at Storm’s End. He replies that he needs the power of the
southron lords to take King’s Landing, and so he must take them from his brother, who owes him loyalty and
obedience as his elder and rightful king. Stannis then asks if Robb has thrown his lot in with Renly, and is told he is
King of the North by the will of the lords and people, and only holds his hand out in friendship. Stannis replies that
kings have no friends, only subjects and enemies.
At this point, Renly’s party arrives with 
Brienne of Tarth
 bearing the banner. Renly asks about Stannis' sigil and the
priestess replies it is the fiery heart of the 
Lord of Light
. Renly says it is just as well since, if they had the same
banner, the battle would be confused. Catelyn expresses hope that there will be no battle, and Stannis states that the
Iron Throne
 is his by rights, and those who deny this are his foes. Catelyn tells them that this is folly with the
Kingslayer
’s host reforming at the 
Golden Tooth
, another 
Lannister
 host gathering at 
Casterly Rock
, and 
Tywin
Lannister
 at 
Harrenhal
 with 20,000 men, and the Lannisters holding 
King's Landing
. Renly immediately demands
that Stannis bend his knee to him, and Stannis absolutely refuses, stating he is eldest and denouncing Renly as a
usurper. Renly responds that the 
Targaryens
 called Robert a usurper and he bore up under the shame. Catelyn tries to

convince them to be reasonable, only to be rebuked by Stannis, who asserts that he is the rightful king; Stannis also
adds that he considers her son no less a traitor than Renly, and promises to deal with Robb in due time. Catelyn asks
how he is the rightful king, given that Robert had two sons, at which Renly laughs, stating that she has not seen
Stannis’ letter. Stannis tells Catelyn that 
Joffrey
 and his siblings are not of Robert’s seed, but bastards born of incest
between Cersei and her brother.
Catelyn asks why Stannis kept this knowledge to himself, and is told that he approached 
Jon Arryn
 since he figured
that Robert would be more willing to listen to Jon, whom he loved, as opposed to Stannis, from whom such
accusations would have seemed self serving. Renly points out that Jon is dead, and Stannis states that his death was
not by happenstance, that 
Cersei
 poisoned him. Catelyn, immediately putting the pieces together, adds that her sister
Lysa
 accused the queen of killing her husband. Renly tells Stannis that he may have the greater right, but Renly has
the bigger army.
Renly reaches under his cloak, and Stannis immediately goes for his sword, but Renly only brings out a peach,
offering it to Stannis. Stannis retorts he did not come there to eat fruit, and Renly replies a man should never refuse a
peach because life is short and as the 
Starks
 say, “Winter is Coming.” Stannis thinks this is a threat but Renly states
it was not, and he tells Stannis he never liked him, but he is of his blood, and if it is Storm’s End he wants, he will
give it to him. Stannis refuses, saying it is his. Renly states he refuses a peach, a castle and did not come to his
wedding. Stannis sneers that the wedding was a farce, considering Renly married a woman he was scheming to
make one of Robert’s whores a year before. Renly corrects this, saying he was going to make 
Margaery Tyrell
 his
queen, but Robert was killed by a boar, and so he got Margaery. He reveals he plans to have a son with her within a
year, and then asks Stannis how many sons he has, telling him that if he had 
a wife that looked like Stannis's
, he
would send 
his fool
 to service her as well. Infuriated, Stannis draws his blade which shines strangely, roaring that he
will not tolerate Renly mocking him to his face, but Brienne moves between them. Stannis tells Renly that he will
not kill Renly with 
Lightbringer
, and will give him till dawn to pledge to him, for the sake of their 
late mother
. In
return, Stannis will grant him Storm’s End, a seat on the council, and name him his heir until he has a son; otherwise
he will destroy Renly. Renly laughs, pointing out that he has the strength in banners: 
House Rowan
, 
House Tarly
,
House Caron
, 
House Tarth
, 
House Penrose
, 
House Fossoway
, 
House Cuy
, 
House Mullendore
, 
House Estermont
,
House Selmy
, 
House Hightower
, 
House Oakheart
, 
House Crane
, 
House Caswell
, 
House Blackbar
, 
House Morrigen
,
House Beesbury
, 
House Shermer
, 
House Dunn
, 
House Footly
 and Stannis' wife’s 
House Florent
. What is present is
only the vanguard, with 100,000 foot still to arrive. After exchanging taunts, Stannis gallops away, the Red Priestess
staying long enough to say before also leaving:
Look to your own sins, Lord Renly.
Catelyn tells Renly that his brother is the lawful heir if Joffrey is Jaime’s son. Renly replies this is true only while he
lives, and asks if Catelyn would agree that it is a fool’s law since he would be a better king than either Robert or
Stannis. He will be a great king:
strong yet generous, clever, just, diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of
forgiveness, patient-
Catelyn adds
-humble?
Renly laughs and states
You must allow a king some flaws, my lady.
Catelyn feels very tired; she has failed, and her son will have to face the Lannisters alone while the Baratheon
brothers destroy each other. She thinks how much Renly is like his brother Robert, but Robert had Eddard to temper
him. Eddard would have prevailed on Robert to bring the whole force to besiege Stannis, the besieger, instead of
forging ahead with only the horses and no fodder. Now he must come to battle soon or starve. Catelyn accompanies
Renly back to his pavilion, sending Hal Mollen to tend to the horses.
Once inside, Renly states his brother has not changed, and since he will not take his gifts, maybe he should fight.

Lord 
Mathis Rowan
 points out that the castle is well provisioned and has a strong garrison under Ser 
Cortnay
Penrose
; they can let Stannis have a profitless siege. Renly, however, is concerned that men will say he fears
Stannis. Lord 
Randyll Tarly
 thinks they cannot leave him unblooded since he may grow stronger than Renly, and the
others seem to agree. Renly decides that they will fight. At this, Catelyn sees no point in not returning to Riverrun,
so she asks to leave, but is told she cannot; she must watch so she can tell her son what happens to rebels.
Renly then gives command of the center to Lord Mathis Rowan, the left to 
Bryce Caron
, and the reserve to Lord
Eldon Estermont
, while Renly takes the right. Lord Mathis Rowan asks who will have the van, and Ser 
Jon
Fossoway
 first asks the honor, but Ser 
Guyard the Green
 states that it should be one of the seven. 
Randyll Tarly
states he led 
Mace Tyrell
’s van since before most of those present were born. After a clamor fills the pavilion, Renly
gives the honor to Ser 
Loras Tyrell
. Ser Loras accepts and asks for one of his knights to ride beside him, so that the
stag and rose can go to battle side by side. Renly gives Brienne this honor. She wants to fight by his side, but is told
that there are four of the 
Rainbow Guard
 that will fight beside him. She accepts the duty, but requests that she arm
him for battle. Renly accepts. Catelyn can hear someone snigger. Renly then asks them to leave him.
Before she leaves, Catelyn asks to visit a sept she saw in a village, and Renly tells Ser 
Robar Royce
 to provide an
escort, but to return by dawn. Catelyn tells him he should also pray, not for victory but for wisdom. Renly tells Ser
Loras to remain with him to help him pray.
Ser Robar Royce is a member of the Rainbow guard and Catelyn knows him slightly, that he is known for his skill in
the tourney, the son of 
Yohn Royce
, bannerman to 
House Arryn
. She asks him about this and he says his father owes
fealty as does his heir, but he is a second son. He is tired of tourneys and looking for glory.
She arrives at her camp to find 
Shadd
 preparing the meal, Hal Mollen dicing with three of his men, and 
Lucas
Blackwood
 sharpening his dagger. Lucas asks if they fight or flee, and she says they pray.

Sansa IV
Sansa
 is called before 
Joffrey
 to pay for her brother 
Robb Stark
’s latest 
victory
. Sansa is being beaten by 
Boros
Blount
 when 
Tyrion Lannister
 arrives. He stops the beating and has her taken to the 
Tower of the Hand
 to be
cleaned up and treated. The next morning he offers her protection, but she refuses.
Synopsis
Sandor Clegane
 is telling 
Sansa
 that if she keeps 
Joffrey
 waiting it will only be worse. As Sansa is making herself
pretty for Joffrey, she wonders if Joffrey has heard about her meetings with Ser 
Dontos
. As they are walking, Sansa
asks the 
Hound
 what she has done and is told that it is what her kingly brother 
Robb Stark
 has done. Sansa tells the
Hound that Robb is the traitor and she had no part; she can only think that if Robb harmed 
Jaime Lannister
 she will
have to face Ser 
Ilyn Payne
. The Hound tells her again that they trained her well, calling her a little bird.
She is led to the lower bailey where a crowd is gathered. She can hear Lord 
Gyles Rosby
 coughing as they part to let
her pass. Ser 
Horas Redwyne
 and 
Hobber Redwyne
 avoid her gaze as she passes. There is a cat shot by a bolt
mewling on the ground. Ser Dontos, riding a broomstick as commanded by the king, whispers to her to “Be brave.”
In the center stands Joffrey with Ser 
Boros Blount
 and Ser 
Meryn Trant
 beside him. She kneels before him, but
Joffrey snaps that kneeling will not save her and she must answer for her brother’s treasons. She is slow to get up,
and the Hound, not ungently, pulls her up when commanded.
Ser 
Lancel Lannister
 now speaks to her, claiming that Robb fell upon Ser 
Stafford Lannister
 with an army of 
wargs
near 
Lannisport
, using some 
sorcery
. Thousands of men were butchered as they slept. According to Lancel, the
northmen
 feasted on their flesh after the slaughter.
Joffrey asks if she has anything to say. Ser Dontos tells him that she is shocked witless. Joffrey then brings up that
her 
direwolf
 savaged him, and Sansa retorts that it was 
Arya
's wolf (
Nymeria
), and that he killed 
Lady
 even though
she never hurt him. Joffrey replies that it was 
Eddard Stark
 that killed Lady, and he killed him. Joffrey then recounts
how he shot a man in the throat at the gates that was bigger than her father. He would shoot her also but 
Cersei
 says
they will kill 
Jaime
. He then commands the Hound to hit Sansa, but Ser Dontos intervenes by wacking her over the
head with his morning star—a melon on the end of a stick. People are laughing, but, despite Sansa’s prayers, Joffrey
does not. Instead he calls to his 
Kingsguard
, telling them to save her face. Ser 
Meryn Trant
 flings Dontos down
while Ser Boros first slams a fist into Sansa’s belly, and then starts to lay the flat of his blade across her thighs. The
Hound rasps “Enough,” but the king orders Boros to make her naked and he tears the silk of her bodice away
exposing her breasts. She can hear sniggers as Joffery orders her beat bloody.
At that point, a voice demands 
"What is the meaning of this?"
. Sansa looks to see the arrival of a furious 
Tyrion
Lannister
, flanked by 
his sellsword
 and 
one of his tribesmen
 who demands Blount tell him what sort of 
knight
 beats
helpless maids. Ser Boros replies one that serves his king, drawing his sword, with Ser Meryn stepping beside him.
Bronn warns them to be careful, as they don’t want to get blood all over their white cloaks. Tryion asks for someone
to give Sansa something to cover herself with, and Sandor tosses her his cloak. Tyrion then asks Joffrey whether he
has no regard for her honor, considering that she is to be his queen one day. Joffrey replies that he is punishing her
for having the blood of the wolf, and Tyrion replies that Joffrey has the wits of a goose. Joffrey insists that the king
can do as he likes, and Tyrion asks if he knows what happened to 
Aerys II Targaryen
, who also did what he liked.

Ser Boros warns Tyrion that no one is to threaten the king, but Tyrion responds he is only educating him, and then
tells Bronn and Timett to kill Ser Boros if he opens his mouth again.
When Ser Boros, turning red, states the queen will hear of this, Tyrion asks if they should send for Cersei. When
Joffrey has nothing to say, Tyrion tells him to learn to use his ears more and his mouth less, lest his reign be shorter
than Tyrion himself. He points out that brutality will not win his people’s love, nor his queen’s. Joffrey replies that
Cersei taught him to value fear over love, and Sansa fears him. Tyrion only notes that it is a pity 
Stannis
 and 
Renly
are not twelve year-old girls as well.
Tyrion then continues by ordering Bronn and Timett to bring Sansa. They take her to the 
Tower of the Hand
. She is
shaking and moving as if she were in a dream. Serving girls clean her up and Maester 
Frenken
 treats her wounds.
Sansa thinks how the Hound hated knights, and now she hates them also, and she does not believe they are true
knights. She sleeps.
She wakes that night and her legs pain her when she gets up. Outside her door, she finds 
a woman
 whom she tells
she wants to go to the 
godswood
; she wants to find Ser Dontos and beg him to take her home before it is too late.
The woman tells her that Tyrion said she was not to leave. When food comes in the morning she tells the servant to
take it away. Later, Tyrion arrives and tells her that she is a guest, not a prisoner.
Tyrion then tells the story of Robb’s victory. Ser Stafford’s host was encamped outside 
Oxcross
. He explains that
there were no army of wargs or sorcery involved as Ser Lancel claimed, as Lancel wouldn’t know a warg from a
wart and according to Tyrion, 
"sorcery is the sauce men spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own
incompetence"
. Robb’s soldiers crept into the camp and cut the horse lines, and then Robb sent his 
direwolf
 among
them, causing a stampede. The panicked horses trampled the camp, killing many. Most of the rest fled in terror,
casting aside their weapons. Among the dead are Ser Stafford (killed by Lord 
Rickard Karstark
), Ser 
Rupert Brax
,
Ser 
Lymond Vikary
, Lord 
Crakehall
, and Lord 
Antario Jast
. Fifty have been taken prisoner including Jast’s sons and
Martyn Lannister
. The incompetent Ser Stafford had not even bothered to post sentries, thinking himself safe and
secure in the Westerlands and most of his army were raw recruits, the sweepings of 
Lannisport
. The only mystery is
how Robb reached Oxcross since 
Lannister
 forces hold the 
Golden Tooth
 and the men stationed there swear Robb
didn't pass them. Tyrion ultimately declares it unimportant; Robb Stark is 
his father
's problem, while Joffrey is his.
Tyrion then asks Sansa how she feels about his nephew and she responds that she loves him with all her heart, more
than ever. Tyrion is amused and tells her someone taught her to lie well, which she may be grateful for one day. He
then asks if she has flowered, to which she answers no. He says that is good, and that he does not intend for her to
marry Joffrey, since there will never be a reconciliation between the Lannisters and 
Starks
 with the way Joffrey has
acted, calling it a pity as the marriage was one of 
Robert I Baratheon
’s better notions. Sansa is concerned that this is
a trick and states she only wants to be loyal. Tyrion adds "...and far from any Lannisters", but admits he cannot
blame her, as when he was her age, he wanted the same thing.
He then notes that she visits the godswood every day and asks what she prays for. Sansa prays for Robb’s victory
and Joffrey’s death, but claims she prays for an end to the fighting. Tyrion tells her there will be another battle
between Robb and 
Tywin Lannister
 and that will settle the issue, warning her not to think that Oxcross was
significant, and to pray that her brother bends his knee, and he will return her to 
Winterfell
 once there is peace. He
offers to have some of his 
clansmen
 guard her, maybe 
Chella
 if she prefers a woman. Sansa, thinking about Ser
Dontos rescuing her, tells him that the wildlings frighten her. He responds that they also frighten Joffrey and the
lickspittles and sycophants who make up his Kingsguard so no one would harm her. When she tells him she would
prefer sleeping in her own bed and the tower is where her father’s men were slain, and their ghosts give her bad
dreams, he agrees to have her escorted back to her bedchamber.

Catelyn
 prays to the seven in a sept in a small village. As she prays, the realization comes to her that both 
Eddard
Stark
 and 
Jon Arryn
 died for their knowledge of 
Cersei’s
 incest, and that 
Bran
 also knows. She arrives back at 
Renly
Baratheon
's pavillion, where 
Brienne of Tarth
 prepares him for battle. She asks Renly to call a Great Council with
his brother and 
Robb
 to let Bran tell what he saw. He refuses to support the concept. Then, a shadow kills Renly.
When the guards arrive, it is assumed that Brienne killed him. Catelyn escapes with her, and they join Catelyn’s
party to leave.
Synopsis
It is full dark before 
Catelyn
, Ser 
Wendel Manderly
 and Ser 
Robar Royce
 arrive at the village. The sept’s seven
walls—one for each god—are cracked and crooked. She enters alone. Catelyn remembers Septon 
Osmynd
 telling
her every god is one with seven aspects. In 
Winterfell
, Septon 
Chayle
 hung carved masks, but here they are but
rough chalk drawings. Catelyn prays to the Mother to spare them if she can, and spare her own sons. She wonders if
Eddard Stark
’s gods ever answered him, and looks around. The Father’s face reminds her of her dying father 
Hoster
Tully
, the Warrior of 
Renly Baratheon
, 
Stannis Baratheon
, 
Robert Baratheon
, 
Robb
, 
Jaime Lannister
, 
Jon Snow
, and
for a second she sees 
Arya
. The smoke burns her eyes, and, after rubbing them, she sees her mother 
Minisa Tully
,
who died in childbirth, in the face of the Mother. When her head starts swimming, she realizes she has not eaten
today; food lost its savor when 
Ned
 died. Then she thinks she can see 
Lysa’s
 face, but the eyes are too hard; it is the
face of 
Cersei
. She first wonders if Cersei prays to the seven also, and then thinks if Robert, who did not regard
Joffrey
 with any warmth, knew that the boy was of Jaime’s seed would have put both him and his mother to death
and few would condemn him. The children born of incest are considered abominations by the followers of both the
old gods
 and the Seven; only among 
the Targaryens
 was such practices common. She realises Eddard and 
Jon Arryn
must have both known, hence why Cersei had them both killed, and she suddenly realizes 
Bran
 knows also. She
prays to the different gods for her children. Ser Robar interrupts her prayers to tell her they must leave to be back
before dawn.
They pass through the army, and to Catelyn it seems like grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners. At Renly’s
pavilion, Ser 
Parmen Crane
 and Ser 
Emmon Cuy
 of the 
Rainbow Guard
 stand guard outside while inside, 
Brienne of
Tarth
 is armoring the king and Lords 
Randyll Tarly
 and 
Mathis Rowan
 are speaking of dispositions and tactics.
Catelyn asks to speak to Renly, but he tells her to wait. Lord Mathis is telling Renly that they should advance before
dawn since the soldiers are in position, and Lord Rowan is agreeing since if they wait, they will charge into the
rising sun, but Renly will not have it said his victory was won by treachery. Renly is sure that Ser Loras will break
the first of Stannis' lines. Renly commands that when his brother falls, his body be treated with respect. When Lord
Tarly asks what to do if Stannis yields, both Renly and Lord Rowan are amused, and Renly recounts how Ser
Gawen Wylde
 tried to escape to surrender to 
Mace Tyrell
 during the siege of 
Storm's End
, and Stannis was going to
hurl him out using a catapult. He was only dissuaded by Maester 
Cressen
 telling him they might have to eat their
dead; mercifully, the 
Onion Knight
 saved them from having to eat the flesh of corpses, though Renly notes this was
little comfort for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell. Renly, assuming Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 will be with Stannis (since
Ser Barristan is neither with him nor with Robb and wants to guard a king), states he wants him spared. Finally,
Renly is ready to hear from Catelyn, the lords departing.
Catelyn now tells Renly that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran, explaining that there was a hunt the day he fell, and

while Robert, Ned and most of the other men were gone, both Jaime Lannister and the queen remained at Winterfell.
She then beseeches Renly to set aside the crown, along with his brother, and Robb would do the same. Then they
could call a 
Great Council
 where Bran will tell his tale so the realm will know the Lannisters are true usurpers.
Renly tells her the time for talk is done. As Brienne is kneeling, belting on Renly’s long sword and dagger, a breeze
seems to fling open the tent flap. Then, Catelyn sees 
a shadow lifting a sword
 that takes Renly in the throat. Brienne
catches Renly as he stumbles into her, his blood flowing over her armor. Ser Robar and Ser Emmon come rushing
in, and, seeing Brienne covered in Renly’s blood, immediately assume she killed him. Ser Emmon immediately
attacks with a battleaxe as Catelyn screams “No!”. Brienne is soon in battle with Ser Emmon and the two men-at-
arms with them. Catelyn starts to tell Ser Robar, who hangs back uncertainly, that is was Stannis, only being able to
explain it as some sort of sorcery, a shadow, swearing on her husband’s grave and her honor. Ser Robar promises to
hold them off and leaves the tent. Brienne has taken out the men-at-arms but now the armored Ser Emmon is in her
wool. Catelyn bashes an iron brazier over Ser Emmon’s helm, sending him to his knees and Brienne, seeing the
chance, slashes through the tent side. Catelyn tells her to follow her slowly so they do not raise suspicions.
Brienne has seen nothing, and Catelyn tells her it was a shadow, and she could feel Stannis. Brienne swears she will
kill Stannis with Renly’s sword. They arrive at the camp, and Catelyn explains that Renly is dead, and there will be
no battle. She tells Brienne to select one of the many spare horses; they have to be far away before they look for
them, so she does not have time to get her own armor and horse. Catelyn tells them to ride, and cut down anyone
that tries to stop them.
Catelyn thinks how all of Renly’s power will now belong to Stannis, won in a single evil stroke; the lords present
will have no choice but to side with the last Baratheon. Then she thinks how Stannis has also declared Robb a traitor
who must be punished, and a chill goes through her as she recalls Stannis's threat that Robb's time will come.

Synopsis
Lord Commander 
Mormont
's men arrive at the 
Fist of the First Men
. 
Jon Snow
 thinks that it actually looks like a fist
plunging up from the ground. The commander tells 
Thoren Smallwood
 it is good ground, and he replies it is an old
place that is strong and will be easy to defend. The commander agrees they are not likely to find a better place to
defend. Its disadvantage, pointed out by Jon, is that they will have to climb down to get water. Their camp is made
behind a stone ring built by the 
First Men
 during the 
Dawn Age
.
As they climbed, 
Ghost
 ran off, and Jon had to keep calling him back, but the commander finally grew impatient and
told Jon to let him go. Jon Snow can tell the travelling is wearing on the Lord Commander, but he tries not to let it
show.
After putting up the Lord Commander’s tent and seeing to the horses, he descends to find Ghost, who suddenly
appears next to him. He feels a growing sense of foreboding. He climbs some rocks from where he can see the
Milkwater
 river and the rugged landscape giving way to high stony hills to the north. When darkness starts to arrive,
Jon is interrupted by 
Samwell Tarly
. Jon tells Sam that the commander plans to stay here and wait for 
Qhorin
Halfhand
 and the men from the 
Shadow Tower
, and he should get a raven ready since the commander will want to
send a message. Sam states the ravens hate being caged, and if he could fly he would be back at 
Castle Black
 and be
eating pork pie.
They return to camp. Overhead, the red tail of 
Mormont’s Torch
 is as bright as the moon. When they arrive, Jon
leaves to attend to the Lord Commander. Mormont, who is talking to some of his officers, tells Jon to bring some
hot spiced wine. As he prepares the wine, he hears 
Jarman Buckwell
 state that following the Milkwater would be the
easiest road to the 
Frostfangs
, but 
Mance Rayder
 will know of their approach. Ser 
Mallador Locke
 recommends
Giant's Stair
 or 
Skirling Pass
. Mormont states he does not want to risk the Frostfangs unless he must. He plans to
remain at the Fist since the 
Wildlings
 outnumber them, and the Wildlings will have to come from the Frostfangs
eventually for food; they will strengthen their defenses. The rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river
since Mormont is sure that 
Craster
 did not lie to them about Mance gathering his force in the Frostfangs. The
officers finish their wine and leave.
Jon offers the commander supper, and he asks if Ghost found any game since they could use meat, and then asks if
Jon agrees with keeping the rangers close. Jon replies that if they stay close, they are unlikely to find his uncle
Benjen Stark
. The commander responds that it would be easier for one man to find 200 than for 200 to find one, and
the land is too vast to search with their limited manpower. They have left a very visible trail, and the fires on the Fist
should be visible to the foothills of the Frostfangs. Jon then brings up the case that his uncle is dead, and the
commander replies that he still may return anyway as a 
Wight
. The commander then tells Jon he will forsake supper

and to wake him at first light.
However, Jon is hungry, and joins 
Dywen
, 
Grenn
, 
Dolorous Edd
, and 
Hake
 for the stew. Dywen states there is a
smell he does not like, a smell of cold. Jon hears a howling and then Ghost appears, surprising Jon since he has
previously refused to come inside the ring. Ghost seems preoccupied, sniffing the air. Suddenly Jon is alarmed since
Ghost knew when the dead came walking, and Dywen has said he smelled cold. Ghost starts to go, and then looks
back, so Jon follows, leaving the protection of the ring. Ghost stops at the stream, and then goes on, so Jon follows,
angry. He loses Ghost a quarter of the way around the Fist. When he catches up with Ghost again, he is digging at a
mound that has been dug only recently. He expects to find a body, but finds a bundle two feet across. Inside the
bundle made from a cloak of the 
Night's Watch
, he finds 
Dragonglass
 weapons.

Jojen Reed
's prophesy has
come true. Jojen now tells him of his 
green dream
 of the sea flowing over the walls of 
Winterfell
. Bran tries to warn
others, but mostly the dream is dismissed. Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
 finally returns with a prisoner, 
Reek
, who was involved
in the forced marriage and then murder of Lady 
Hornwood
. Jojen reveals to Bran that he had a green dream in which
Reek is skinning off Bran's face.
Synopsis
Bran
 is found working the bellows for 
Mikken
 by 
Alebelly
 to tell him that there has been a bird from 
Robb Stark
.
Bran lets Alebelly carry him to Maester 
Luwin
's turret where 
Rickon
 already waits. The maester informs them that
Robb shattered a 
Lannister
 army at the 
Battle of Oxcross
, killing its commander Ser 
Stafford Lannister
. He has also
captured several castles, and is currently at 
Ashemark
, the stronghold of 
House Marbrand
. Rickon asks if Robb is
coming home, but Bran knows that only Lord 
Tywin Lannister
 matters, as 
Big Walder
 states, which disquiets him.
Neither Big Walder nor 
Little Walder
 seem upset about their uncle Ser 
Stevron Frey
's death, who, they note, was
very old (50 or 60) and always tired. Little Walder asks if Ser 
Emmon Frey
 is now heir, and his cousin tells him the
line of ascension: Ser 
Ryman
, 
Edwyn
, 
Black Walder
, 
Petyr
, then 
Aegon Frey
 and his sons. Little Walder states theat
Ryman is too old, and then asks if they think he will be lord, and Big Walder responds he will be lord and does not
care. The maester tells them that they should be ashamed.
Osha
 arrives to carry him; she is stronger than Alebelly. Bran asks if she knows the way north, and she tells him it is
easy. He then asks if the 
children of the forest
, the 
Others
 and 
giants
 are still there and she tells him she has seen
giants and heard of the others. He then asks about the 
three-eyed crow
, which she has never heard of. She sets him
on the window seat of his bedchamber.
Shortly thereafter, 
Jojen
 enters the room unbidden with 
Meera
 behind him. Bran asks Jojen if he has heard about the
bird; he states it was not supper, it was a letter from Robb. Jojen explains that the 
green dreams
 are not easy to
understand. When Bran asks Jojen to tell him his dream, Jojen reveals that he dreamed the sea was lapping all
around Winterfell. Waves crashed against the gates and towers, and the water came flowing over the walls and filled
the castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard. He now recognizes these men and declares that they are Alebelly,
Septon 
Chayle
, and 
Mikken
. Bran, confused and dismayed, replies that the sea is hundreds of leagues away, and
Winterfell's walls are so high the water could not get in even if it did come. Jojen only repeats his claim, adding that
he saw the dead, bloated and drowned.
Bran wants to warn the men, but Jojen tells him it will not save them, as they will not believe him. He then asks
Bran to tell of his wolf dream, and Bran replies that there are different kinds. There are the wolf dreams, which are
not as bad as the others, in which he runs, hunts and kills squirrels. He has other dreams where the crow comes and
tells him to fly. Sometimes the tree is also calling his name in those dreams, which frightens him, but not as much as
when he falls. He explains that he never used to fall while climbing, and that he used to feed the crows in the Burned
Tower. Yet, he did fall eventually, and now when he sleeps he falls all the time.
Jojen tells Bran that he will be called a 
warg
 if others hear of his wolf dreams, and some will hate him in fear, as the
power is strong in him. Bran is concerned since in 
Old Nan
's stories wargs were always evil, and tells Jojen that he

wants to be a 
knight
. Jojen replies that he is a winged wolf but will never fly unless he opens the eye in his forehead,
and he must search for it with his heart. When Bran states that Maester Luwin claims dreams are just that, Jojen
responds they are the past, the future, and truth. With that they leave him, and Bran tries unsuccessfully to open his
third eye.
On the following days, Bran tries to warn his household, but no one seems to believe him. Mikken thinks it funny,
and states he always wanted to see the sea. Septon Chayle states the gods will take him when they do, and he does
not think he will drown since he grew up on the banks of the 
White Knife
. Alebelly takes heed, and refuses to bathe
or go near a well until finally other guardsmen give him a bath because he stinks so badly.
Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
 returns with a man that 
Hayhead
 tells Bran is named 
Reek
. He served the now-dead 
Ramsay
Snow
 (the Bastard of Bolton). The bastard and Reek murdered Lady 
Hornwood
. Rodrik’s men shot Snow as he
attempted to ride away. He had forced Lady Hornwood to marry him and then to sign a will naming him heir. Ser
Rodrik is concerned that 
Roose Bolton
 may not agree that doing this under duress would make the marriage and the
will invalid. Rodrik wants to keep Reek alive for judgement when Robb returns. Meanwhile, 
House Manderly
 and
House Bolton
 are fighting in the 
Hornwood
 forest, and Rodrik does not have the strength to stop them.
Ser Rodrik then brings up Bran commanding Alebelly not to bathe. Bran tells him about the green dream. Maester
Luwin tells Rodrik that he has explained to Bran the uncertainty of prophesies, but then notes that raiders in
longships have been plundering and raping along the 
Stony Shore
, and 
Leobald Tallhart
 sent his nephew 
Benfred
Tallhart
 to deal with it. After he gets more information about the green dream, Rodrik promises not to take Alebelly
with him if he rides against the raiders. Bran takes some hope in this.
When Bran meets with the 
Reeds
 later that night, Meera agrees that it should be possible to change prophesies.
Meera gets angry with her brother when he disagrees, claiming that what he sees always comes true. Then Meera
states that Alebelly and Bran should both fight to avoid their fates. Bran asks if he drowns also and Jojen reveals
another dream of his, in which Bran and Rickon lay dead at Reek's feet, and he was skinning off their faces with a
long red blade. Meera states that she could go down to the dungeons and kill Reek now, but Jojen tells her she will
not succeed; first the jailers would stop her, and they will never believe. Even if Bran went to 
Greywater Watch
, he
could not avoid his fate; the green dreams do not lie.

The 
small council
 is discussing the news of 
Renly
's mysterious murder. 
Tyrion
 points out that they have an
opportunity to recruit 
House Tyrell
 to 
Joffrey I
 since they loved Renly but not 
Stannis Baratheon
. To recruit them,
Tyrion recommends that Joffrey marry 
Margaery Tyrell
. 
Cersei
 does not like the idea, stating Joffrey will not like it,
but eventually agrees. Neither Cersei nor Tyrion want to leave King’s Landing to meet with the Tyrells but
Littlefinger
 volunteers, expecting a reward for his service.
Synopsis
Varys
 reports the 
mysterious murder
 of 
Renly
, whose throat was cut like soft cheese. The reports of the murderer
vary: Stannis with a 
magic sword
, a knight of his 
Rainbow Guard
, a maid, a woman spurned, or Lady 
Catelyn Stark
.
The 
small council
, including 
Cersei
, 
Tyrion
, and 
Littlefinger
, are not pleased with the report since they expect the
truth, not rumors. Varys assures them it is not a ruse, and that Renly is dead.
Tyrion notes that 
Joffrey
 will not be happy since he was reserving a spike for Renly’s head. Tyrion himself is also
unhappy since he was depending on the brothers to decimate each other's armies in battle, but points out the killer's
identity is irrelevant; Stannis has to be behind Renly's death, as he stood to gain the most from it.
Varys reports the foot remain at 
Bitterbridge
 and most of the lords have gone over to 
Stannis Baratheon
 with, as
Littlefinger assumed, Lord 
Alester Florent
 being first. 
Loras Tyrell
, 
Randyll Tarly
, and 
Mathis Rowan
 did not
switch allegiance, and Ser 
Cortnay Penrose
 will not yield 
Storm's End
 until he sees Renly’s body, which has
disappeared. A fifth of the knights left with Loras, who had killed three of Renly’s guards in anger, including
Emmon Cuy
 and 
Robar Royce
. Loras is probably headed to Bitterbridge for his sister 
Margaery Tyrell
 and the foot
still there. Tyrion notes that this is an opportunity to win the Tyrells to their cause; they may have loved Renly, but
perhaps they can be convinced to prefer Joffrey over Stannis. Littlefinger suggests bribes, but both Varys and Tyrion
do not think gold will win 
Highgarden
. Littlefinger admits they are right, and states that Loras, although a younger
son, is 
Mace Tyrell
’s favorite, so they just have to win him. Tyrion suggests marrying 15- or 16-year-old Margaery
to the 13-year-old Joffrey. Cersei objects that Joffrey is promised to 
Sansa Stark
, but Tyrion responds that there is no
advantage in wedding the king to the daughter of a 
dead traitor
. Littlefinger adds that the Tyrells are wealthier than
the 
Starks
 and Margaery is lovely and beddable.
When Tyrion states that Joffrey should like this, Cersei replies her son is too young to care about such things. Tyrion
notes that he was the same age as Joffrey when he married. Cersei insists that Joffrey is made of finer stuff, but
Tyrion reminds her that he ordered Sansa stripped by Ser 
Boros Blount
.
Tyrion has spoken to Varys about arranging a secret visit to 
Chataya
’s for Joffrey; Tyrion hopes that it will sweeten
him. He noted that they will have to arrange to do it when 
Sandor Clegane
 is busy. Varys agreed to look into the
matter.
Tyrion tells Cersei that the marriage may be the only way for Joffrey to live to his wedding night and Littlefinger
adds that Sansa brings only her body to Joffrey’s bed, while Margaery would bring 50,000 swords. Varys adds that
the needs of the realm come before the king’s own desires. Cersei states that the king would never agree to Renly’s
leavings, and Tyrion replies that when the king comes of age in 3 years he can make his own decisions, but until

then he does as the 
Hand of the King
 and the regent say. Cersei agrees but warns them if Joffrey does not like
Margaery.
Tyrion brings up the need to send one of them to Bitterbridge before Loras’ blood cools; Loras will scarcely deal
with 
Bronn
 or 
Shagga
. Cersei first recommends Ser 
Jacelyn Bywater
, but Tyrion points out that whoever they send
must be able to make decisions for the king and council. Cersei recommends Tyrion as 
Hand of the King
 and Tyrion
recommends Cersei as the king’s mother. Littlefinger volunteers, stating he would make a poor hostage and neither
Loras nor Mace bears any enmity towards him. Tyrion does not like it since he does not trust Littlefinger but if he
leaves 
King's Landing
 for any time, everything he worked for would be undone. There is fighting on the route to
Bitterbridge, so Littlefinger will need a strong escort. Tyrion initially offers 100 
gold cloaks
 and they agree on 300
plus 40 knights with squires to give Littlefinger a knightly tail to impress the Tyrells. Littlefinger states he will take
Horas Redwyne
 and 
Hobber Redwyne
 (Horror and Slobber) who will be sent on to their father as a gesture of good
will since 
Paxter Redwyne
 is an old friend of Mace Tyrell's. Cersei expresses wrath at this since 
House Redwyne
would have declared for Renly except for the twins being held hostage. Littlefinger notes that Renly is dead and
Stannis and Lord Paxter have an enmity against each other from the siege of Storm's End. Tyrion decides to send Ser
Hobber and keep Ser Horas in King’s Landing. Littlefinger also demands plenty of horses and gold, and a
commission in writing, which Tyrion agrees to, so Littlefinger states he will start before dawn, but is expecting a
suitable reward for his services. Cersei asks him what he wants, and Littlefinger replies he will think about it. Tyrion
instructs Varys to get parchment and quill, and they will need someone to wake Joffrey.
Cersei asks Tyrion about his chain, and he tells her it is getting longer link by link, and that they should thank Ser
Cortnay since Stannis will not march north with Storm’s End untaken. Cersei now tells Tyrion that he has been a
great help, contrary to what she expected, and kisses him on the brow.
When Cersei leaves, Tyrion tells Bronn that Cersei is up to something, and asks Bronn to try to find out what;
Tyrion hates surprises.

Theon IV
At the 
Stony Shore
, 
Theon Greyjoy
 and his men have won an easy victory against a force led by 
Benfred Tallhart
.
Feeling dissatisfied, Theon meets with 
Dagmer
 on Dagmer's ship and admits to his feelings. He lays out a plan for
Dagmer, which he means to proof himself worthy with to his father, Lord 
Balon Greyjoy
.
Synopsis
Theon Greyjoy
's men have defeated the 
Wild Hares
 and have captured their leader, 
Benfred Tallhart
. Theon
attempts to question Benfred, but the only replies he receives are threats about what 
Robb Stark
 will do to him and
Benfred's spittle. Theon's uncle, 
Aeron Greyjoy
, insists that Benfred be sacrificed to the 
Drowned God
 by drowning,
and Theon finally gives in. Aeron insists that Theon be in charge of Benfred's execution, but Theon declines. As he
walks away, Theon figures that being drowned might be a service to Benfred, since his neck is thick with muscle
and fat and 
Stygg
 is not an expert headman. Theon thinks back to when he had spend a fortnight in Benfred's
company three years ago when he had accompanied 
Eddard Stark
 to 
Torrhen's Square
 for a visit with Ser 
Helman
Tallhart
. During the entire fortnight, Theon had mocked Benfred's neck, to see how angry he could make Benfred
for it.
He can hear the noise of his men celebrating their victory and climbes some stones to reach them. He watches the
dead men and horses on the ground; While 
Tymor
 and his brothers had gathered the unhurt mounts, 
Urzen
 and
Black 
Lorren
 had killed those who could not be saved. He sees his men "paying the iron price" for their valuables by
looting the corpses as the ironborn of old did. As he sees 
Gevin Harlaw
 sawing off a man's finger to get a ring,
Theon wonders whether he should search the two men he killed during the battle. However, the thought of what
Eddard Stark
 would say about it, which frustrates him. He then sees 
Maron Botley
 sitting by his pile of collected
plunder, to which his sons are adding. One of them is in a shoving match with an obviously drunk 
Todric
. Theon
asks 
Wex Pyke
 for his bow and plans to shoot the ale horn out of Todric's hand, but as he looses his arrow Todric
moves and is hit in the belly. This gets the attention of the other looters, whom Theon addresses, telling them that he
had previously told them that he abides no drunkards and no squabbles over plunder. Theon orders Botley to silence
Todric. Botley and his sons are quick to obey and immediately strip the dead Todric of his valuables. Theon thinks
to himself that, although 
his father
 has given him the command, some of his men see him as "a soft boy from the
green lands", and hopes that killing Todric has made them realize he means what he says.
Theon kicks Benfred's banner, wondering about the 
rabbit skin
 tied to it and frustrated that he does not feel elated as
he did after the 
Battle of the Whispering Wood
. As he returns to his 
Sea Bitch
, he sees Benfred's limp body being
dragged from the water.
Theon is bothered by the fact that all of his work, including the attack on the fishing village, will be put down to
raiders, as word about the hosting of the 
Iron Islands
 has been effectively kept secret. He knows the northmen will
not realize their peril until 
Deepwood Motte
 and 
Moat Cailin
 are attacked and bitterly thinks to himself that songs
will be sung for Asha after all is over, while he will be forgotten. He is determined not to allow that to happen.
Theon goes to 
Foamdrinker
, where he finds 
Dagmer
, who he had left behind to guard the ships to prevent him from
getting credit for the successful attack. Dagmer notes that Theon does not smile despite the victory. Theon tells
Dagmer that they need to talk, so he takes him to his cabin in 
Foamdrinker
. There, Theon states that they did not

capture enough horses, and Dagmer asks why they need horses since Balon ordered them to only harry the coast.
Theon admits that he has a plan, hoping the tone in Dagmer's voice he hears is interest, not disapproval.
Theon realizes he needs to use Dagmer's pride when Dagmer states he is and always has been Balon's best man. He
complements him with being the most skilled swordman and spearman on the Iron Islands, to which Dagmer
disagrees. Although he used to be, he informs Theon that now 
Andrik
, who serves Lord 
Dunstan Drumm
, and Black
Lorren
 and 
Qarl the Maid
 are said to be the best. Theon counters, saying that Andrik is not nearly as feared as
Dagmer and claiming that raiding is no work for "Lord Balon's best man". Dagmer tells Theon that he is aware that
it is Theon who feels wasted, and Theon replies that it should have been him who had his sister's command. Dagmer
explains that, with Maron and Rodrik dead and Theon a hostage in the north, Balon had learned to rely on Asha,
who has never failed him. Theon states that he has never failed Balon either, and that the 
Starks
 knew his worth. He
cites he was one of 
Brynden Tully
's picked scouts. He was in the first wave at Whispering Wood, and almost
crossed swords with 
Jaime Lannister
, prevented only by the intervention of 
Daryn Hornwood
, who died in the act.
Dagmer tells Theon that he knows Theon is no craven, having trained him in his youth. He admits to Theno that the
Starks had Theon for ten years, and that 
Robb Stark
 is Theon's friend. Theon replies that he is no 
Stark
 but a
Greyjoy
, and means to be his father's heir, but needs a way to prove himself in order to achieve that. Dagmer
reminds Theon that he is young and other wars will come in which he can prove his worth, but that they are now
commanded to raid. At that, Theon reveals his plan; He will give Aeron six ships to raid, but means to "do a deed
that the harpers will sing of for a thousand years", knowing that Dagmer loves to hear the song about the axe which
had split his jaw in half. He tells Dagmer that he is to march on 
Torrhen's Square
, the seat of Ser 
Helman Tallhart
.
Helman took his best men south, and Benfred and the sons of those men are now dead. All that remains is a small
garrison under 
Leobald Tallhart
. Dagmer is to make no secret of his approach and start building siege engines when
he arrives. When Dagmer protests that siege engines are not the 
ironmen
's way, Theon replies that Leobald will not
know that. Upon seeing the siege engines, Leobald will call for help, and Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, 
Winterfell
's castellan,
will ride to Leobald's aid in strength. Dagmer states he will certainly be outnumbered and cannot ever take Torrhen's
Square, but Theon replies that it is 
not Torrhen's Square
 he means to take.

Tywin Lannister
’s host is leaving 
Harrenhal
. Arya has been kept busy delivering messages for Weese, and she wants
to find 
Jaqen H'ghar
 before he leaves. She finally finds Jaqen and gives him Weese’s name. As she watches 
Tywin
Lannister
 lead his host out of the castle, she realizes that she has been targeting the wrong people, people who really
do not matter. She goes in search of Jaqen, but finds Weese’s dead body first.
Synopsis
The Castle is in an uproar with preparations for 
Tywin Lannister
’s host’s departure. Ser 
Addam Marbrand
 was the
first to depart, a day before the rest. 
Weese
 calls Ser Addam a great horseman and sword fighter, and Lord Tywin’s
most daring commander. Arya hopes Ser Addam and all his men die. She is sure that they are going to fight 
Robb
Stark
, and wonders what Robb has accomplished.
Arya has been kept busy running messages from dawn to dust. She has even delivered messages beyond the wall,
and considered running away except that Weese told her he would deliver her to 
Vargo Hoat
; maybe if Weese were
dead. Weese does not know Arya can read, so he never seals his messages. That day, she delivers a message
demanding payment for a debt to a knight who cannot read. She reads it to him, and he tries to hit her so she takes a
silver banded drinking horn from him and flees, giving it to Weese. For this Arya is promised the reward of sharing
a crisp capron with Weese that night. As she runs errands, she searches for 
Jaqen H'ghar
 to give him another name
before he leaves. She finally asks a gate guard and is told that Ser 
Amory Lorch
 is to be castellan of 
Harrenhal
, so
Jaqen will not be leaving. The 
Brave Companions
 will also be left to do foraging. Unfortunately, the Mountain will
be leaving to command Tywin’s van in battle, putting him, 
Dunsen
, 
Polliver
, and 
Rafford
 beyond reach.
Weese gives Arya a message for 
Lucan
 that Ser 
Lyonel
, who is to ride with 
Kevan Lannister
, needs a new sword.
When she reaches the armory she spies 
Gendry
 and asks him which one of the men is Lucan, he tells her that 
Hot
Pie
 asked him if he heard her scream 
Winterfell
 when they were fighting on the wall. Arya immediately claims she
didn’t and Gendry tells her she did, but that he told Hot Pie he needs to clean out his ears because she yelled “Go to
hell” and she better have the same story; she does not want Hot Pie to know who she really is, and thinks maybe she
should give Jaqen his name. Gendry gets Lucan, who pulls down a longsword and gives it to Arya with the message
that it is too good for such an oaf. Arya claims she will pass on the message, but will not because Weese would beat
her bloody. The longsword feels good in Arya’s hand, although a lot heavier than 
Needle
, and she thinks that she
may not be a 
Water Dancer
 but she is not a mouse either. She considers using the note to get a horse, pretending she
is doing it for Ser Lyonel since the stableboys are not able to read.
She is trying to decide whether to take the chance when she overhears some archers talk. One says that Robb
brought giants from the north, another that Starks are more like wolves than men, and then one states that Robb is
scared to attack Harrenhal, and would piss in his pants if he knew they were coming. One man comments that
maybe they are the ones that should run. She thinks that yes, they should run or her brother will kill them. She is
interrupted by Weese, who has come up in front of her and she did not see him. He complains that she took long
enough, and snatches the sword from her, slapping her with the back of his hand and telling her next time she will be
faster. She was a wolf and suddenly is not. He asks her if she wants another slap, and tells her he wants none of her
insolent looks, and to tell 
Tuffleberry
 he has barrels for him but he needs to send lads to fetch them. He then warns
her to run if she wants to eat tonight, and not to get lost again or she will be beat bloody.

Halfway to the brewhouse, she runs into 
Rorge
 and three other of Ser Amory’s men. He calls her “Yoren’s little
cunt” and recalls that he promised to fuck her with her stick, saying she is no longer so brave now that he is not
wearing chains. When she tells him she is looking for Jaqen, she can see something in his eyes, possibly fear. He
tells her he is in the bathhouse and to get out of his way. In the bathhouse, she tries to sneak up on Jaqen, but he
knows she is there, telling her the scuff of leather on stone is as loud as warhorns to a man with open ears, and
clever girls go barefoot. She is upset that he heard her, and whispers Weese’s name in his ear. He states that a man
will attend him at his leisure.
She gives Tuffleberry the message and he curses, saying his lads are busy and that he will have those barrels within
an hour, or Lord Tywin will hear of it. Weese is not happy about this message, but finds six men.
Supper is a thin stew, and Weese shares his capon with a woman who has been sleeping with him. When he sees
Arya staring, he reminds her he told her what would happen if he caught her staring. He slaps her, then shoves her
and her dress catches on a loose nail and rips. Weese commands her to fix that before she sleeps.
She is kicked awake in the morning by Weese, who tells them that the work will not get easier now that Tywin’s
host is gone. Later, Arya watches as Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan pass, followed by their great lords and captains.
Last comes 
Gregor Clegane
, with 
Polliver
 beside him wearing Gendry’s helmet. Suddenly Arya realizes she was
stupid and that neither 
Chiswyck
 nor 
Weese
 mattered. Why didn’t she say Lord Tywin? She hurries to find Jaqen to
tell him.
She hears a shriek of pain, and finds a dozen people looking at the body of Weese with his ugly dog on his chest.
Every so often the dog rips a mouthful of flesh off his face. One man exclaims that he had that bitch since it was
pup, and it must be 
Harren’s
 ghost. When Arya lifts her gaze, she sees Jaqen on the battlements, who casually lays
two fingers across his cheek.

Synopsis
Catelyn
 and her escort are nearing 
Riverrun
 and are met by 
Martyn Rivers
 and his outriders. She learns that 
Robb
has crushed Ser 
Stafford Lannister
’s levies, and that the 
Greatjon
 has seized three of the 
Lannisters
' gold mines.
Robb reached 
Oxcross
 by following a trail 
Grey Wind
 had discovered around the 
Golden Tooth
. However, Martyn
tells her that Lord 
Tywin
 is marching on Riverrun as they speak. Catelyn makes all haste back to her father 
Hoster's
castle, but first takes 
Brienne
 as her sworn sword, to prevent the girl from doing anything foolish. Catelyn is fearful
of her brother 
Edmure's
 chances in battle against Lord Tywin, and outside Riverrun discovers 
Lannister men
hanging from the walls. Edmure informs her that four men from Ser 
Cleos's
 party attempted to free Ser 
Jaime
, and
nearly succeeded. They were hanged for their deeds, and the Kingslayer was placed in the deep dungeons and
chained to the wall. Her father's steward, 
Utherydes Wayn
, asks Catelyn if there is no hope of aid from the south,
hoping that 
Stannis Baratheon
 will be forced to make common cause with them, but Catelyn gives no answer, since
'Stannis has made common cause with '
a power greater and darker
'.
Edmure also explains that birds have arrived from 
Storm's End
, with messages from Ser 
Cortnay Penrose
 seeking
help. Cortnay claimed he feared for the boy 
Edric Storm
, 
Robert's
 only known high-born bastard. Catelyn makes
known her dissent in Edmure giving Lord Tywin battle. Her brother has commanded 
Roose Bolton
 to take
Harrenhal
, and has also called the levies from the 
Twins
, those under the command of Ser 
Helman Tallhart
. Catelyn
argues that Robb left those men to make certain Lord 
Walder
 kept faith. She learns that Roose wed 
one of Lord
Walder's daughters
.
Catelyn then visits her father, but Lord Hoster mistakes her for 
Lysa
, and mumbles several strange, disjointed lines,
"
Jon
’s a good man…strong, kind…you’ll wed when Catelyn does…That stripling…wretched boy…not speak that
name to me, your duty…". Catelyn is then led by Utherydes to the 
silent sisters
 who possess Lord 
Eddard's
 bones.
When she states that she must thank 
Cersei
 for even this much, her father's steward tells her to thank the 
Imp
, since
it was his doing. Catelyn thinks to herself "One day I will thank them all".
Catelyn commands the silent sisters to lay Ned's bones to rest in the 
crypts of Winterfell
, and then asks to be left
alone with her husband's body, musing that she envies the silent sisters for their supposed ability to speak to the
dead.

Synopsis
Daenerys
 relates to 
Xaro Xhoan Daxos
 how the 
Pureborn
 have denied her, despite all the customary bribes and
traditional proceedings she followed. Daenerys' hope of obtaining ships and men from the Pureborn was in vain, and
now she has to move on. The Pureborn are interested only in her dragons, not in her cause. She again beseeches
Xaro for ships, but the merchant prince tells her he has no warships. He asks her again to marry him, and she again
refuses. She considers going to the 
Warlocks
 for aid, and again Xaro warns her not to. As they move through the
marketplace, Daenerys witnesses a firemage make a ladder of fire and climb it into the sky, as cutpurses move
through the astonished crowd. Xaro declares the feat a fine trick, but 
Quaithe
 appears and tells them it was no trick.
The shadowbinder tells Daenerys that half a year ago, the man could scarcely make even a small fire appear, but his
power has grown now, and all because of Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons. Quaithe warns, "You must leave this
city soon…or you will never be permitted to leave it at all." Daenerys realizes that Quaithe wants her to go to
Asshai
, and when she asks why, the shadowbinder tells her it is there she will find truth. Her khas warn her not to
trust the Asshai’i shadowbinder, and Xaro concurs. Later, Ser 
Jorah
 tells her she will find no help in 
this city
. He
explains why Xaro wants to marry her: During a Qartheen wedding ceremony, the bride and groom each ask one
thing from each other that the other cannot refuse. Ser Jorah is convinced that Xaro plans to obtain one of her
dragons in this way. He tells her she should go east, but not to Asshai. When Daenerys suggests returning west to
Illyrio
, Jorah warns her that the Magister cares only for himself and would provide no help. Daenerys believes he
will give her the ships and soldiers to retake 
Westeros
, but Jorah states, "Nothing knits a broken realm together so
quick as an invading army on its soil.”
He reminds her that a man was sent to kill her when 
Robert Baratheon
 heard that she was pregnant, and fears what
might happen when word spreads of her dragons. Daenerys wonders why the comet led her to Qarth if not to obtain
ships and an army, and Ser Jorah implores her to go to 
Pyat Pree
 for help.

Synopsis
Tyrion
, the royal family, and their retainers are at the docks to see Princess 
Myrcella
 off to 
Dorne
. Tyrion is sending
Arys Oakheart
 with her as her 
sworn shield
. Prince 
Doran Martell
 has promised to move his banners into the high
passes once Myrcella is safely at 
Sunspear
.
Tyrion knows one of 
Cersei
’s secrets, how she is consorting with the unsavory hedge knight 
Osmund Kettleblack
and his brothers in order to raise her own force of sellswords. What the Queen doesn’t know is that 
Bronn
 is
matching every copper she gives the 
Kettleblacks
, thus Ser Osmund is really one of Tyrion’s men. On the ride back
to 
Maegor's Holdfast
, things get out of hand when someone in the crowd hits 
Joffrey
 in the face with dung, and the
king sends 
the Hound
 to deal with the perpetrator. The crowd, frenzied due to the lack of food and the harsh living
conditions, boils over and begins to trample the procession. Sensing what is about to happen, Tyrion screams for
them to ride hard for the gates of the Holdfast. In the mad rush, several members are lost, and by the time Tyrion
reaches the safety of the gates, their lives are in doubt.
As Joffrey is ranting about traitors and how they attacked him, Tyrion dismounts and slaps him so hard his crown
flies off, and then shoves him to the ground, shouting, "You set your dog on them! What did you imagine they
would do?" Tyrion commands Ser 
Boros
 and Ser 
Meryn
 to return and find 
Sansa
 and those missing, and when the
two 
Kingsguard
 balk, Cersei begins to berate them as well for their cowardice. Sansa returns, saved by Sandor
Clegane who is covered in blood. Meanwhile, a fire has broken out in the city, and Tyrion can see the fear in the
Hound's eyes when he commands the men to go and put out the fire.
Later, it is discovered that 
Preston Greenfield
, 
Aron Santagar
, and the 
High Septon
 lost their lives; Lady 
Tanda
’s
daughter 
Lollys
 is found alive, having been raped by fifty men outside a tanner’s shop, and Tyrion’s cousin 
Tyrek
 is
missing. Tyrion wants his cousin found, mostly because the boy’s father 
Tygett
 was always kind to Tyrion. He is
dismayed to learn from 
Jacelyn Bywater
 that many of the 
City Watch
 and the common folk consider Tyrion the
problem in the city, and would revolt given the chance. Later, Bronn remarks, while 
Varys
 is in the room, that things
would be a lot easier if 
Tommen
 were king. Tyrion understands this as a hint that Bronn thinks Joffrey should be
killed.

Davos III
Synopsis
Davos
 has recently returned to 
Stannis
's fleet after delivering the king’s message throughout the realm. He learns
that Stannis has been having terrible nightmares, and that only Lady 
Melisandre
 can soothe him to sleep. She has
been sharing his pavilion of late, and he wonders how she soothes him to sleep.
Ser 
Cortnay Penrose
 arrives to parley with Stannis, and scorns the king and all his new-found allies who were so
recently sworn to 
Renly
. He especially mocks Lord 
Alester Florent
, for not only changing sides, but changing gods
as well.
Ser Cortnay will not accept Stannis’ demands, and will not surrender 
Storm's End
 nor 
Robert
’s bastard 
Edric Storm
.
The Castellan throws his gauntlet in King Stannis’ face, and proposes single combat to settle the issue. Stannis
rejects him, stating he will take the castle by storm if he must, to which Ser Cortnay responds, "Bring on your storm
- and recall, if you do, the name of this castle." Stannis dismisses all his men save Davos, seeking the former
smuggler’s advice. Davos states his respect for Ser Cortnay, who kept his faith, unlike all these new lords in Stannis’
army. Stannis dislikes them as much, but he needs their strength in order to win his throne. Stannis sent Ser 
Parmen
Crane
 to 
Bitterbridge
 to gather the rest of Renly’s army, but there has been no word since. He tells Davos that he
grieves for his brother Renly, and dreams of a green pavilion and the manner of Renly’s death, even though he was
in bed at the time of Renly’s demise. Stannis says, "…but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go
to my grave thinking of 
my brother’s peach
."
Davos advises him to strike for 
King's Landing
 at once, but Stannis will not leave Storm’s End untaken in his rear,
for men will consider him defeated there. Stannis then tells Davos that he must have the boy 
Edric Storm
, as
Melisandre has seen it in her flames; and she has also seen Ser Cortnay’s death, as she saw Renly’s at 
Dragonstone
.
The king commands Davos to bring Melisandre by boat under the cover of darkness beneath Storm’s End, as he did
some 15 years before.
That night, Davos is sickened by what he must do for his king. He asks Melisandre if she is good or evil, and she
responds, "Oh, good. I am a 
knight
 of sorts myself. A champion of light and life." Davos calls her a liar, for she
means to kill a man this very night, as she killed 
Maester Cressen
 and Renly. The Red Woman responds that the
maester poisoned himself, and that she had nothing to do with Renly’s death. However, she later admits that Renly
was unprotected, while the walls of Storm’s End have spells woven into the stones, and that no shadow can pass
from the outside. When Davos proclaims that a shadow is a thing of darkness, Melisandre rebuffs him, stating that
shadows don’t exist in the dark, they are servants of light and fire, provided by her god, 
R'hllor
.
When they arrive at a gate in a water tunnel beneath the castle, Melisandre disrobes, and Davos watches in horror as
the now pregnant woman gives birth to a shadow, and Davos recognizes the man who cast it.

Synopsis
Jon
 hears the call of a warhorn, one blast to signify brothers returning. 
Qhorin Halfhand
 has arrived, with 100 men
from the 
Shadow Tower
. Qhorin recognizes Jon, and tells him that he knew Lord 
Eddard
 and Jon’s grandfather Lord
Rickard
 as well. The men from the Shadow Tower were delayed because they met 
Alfyn Crowkiller
 and his men
who had been scouting along 
the Wall
. They killed the wildling leader and took some captives, but lost four men in
the process. Later, Jon overhears dissent in the ranks as 
Chett
 and 
Lark
 the Sisterman speak of not going into the
Frostfangs
, no matter what the 
Old Bear
 orders. Jon has given the warhorn he found to 
Sam
, because it is cracked
and he could get no sound from it, but Sam likes ancient items.
In Mormont's tent, Jon overhears Qhorin telling Mormont about a captive claiming that 
Mance Rayder
 had 
wargs
and 
mammoths
 in his army. He also explains that the captive claims the wildlings plan to breach the Wall, not climb
it or burrow beneath it. Qhorin tells them that Mance is seeking something in the high, cold places of the Frostfangs,
some power or artifact. Qhorin advises the Old Bear to send scouts into the mountains, and Mormont agrees. 
Jarmen
Buckwell
 will take four men to climb the 
Giant's Stair
, 
Thoren Smallwood
 will lead a party to probe the 
Milkwater
,
while Qhorin himself will lead a third party into the 
Skirling Pass
. Qhorin immediately chooses Jon Snow as one of
his four men, stating, "The 
old gods
 are still strong 
beyond the Wall
. The gods of the 
First Men
…and the 
Starks
."

Tyrion XI
Synopsis
Tyrion
 learns from 
Lancel
 that 
the Queen
 intends to hide 
Tommen
 away at 
Rosby
 under the care of Lord 
Gyles
. He
is disturbed that 
Varys
 has not learned of this, or decided not to inform him.
Later, Tyrion has 
Bronn
 deliver word to Ser 
Jacelyn Bywater
, commanding him to take fifty men and capture Lord
Gyles' party, and to expel the garrison and keep Tommen safe at Rosby. He does not want Lord Rosby hurt, nor any
killing done in front of Tommen. For this, Ser Jacelyn will earn a lordship. Bronn offers to do the job instead if
there's a lordship in it for him, but Tyrion refuses, privately noting that Bywater's men will defend Tommen whereas
Bronn's are more likely to sell Tommen to the crown's enemies if the coming battle goes against them.
Tyrion then sets out for 
Chataya
’s, but then abandons his patience and rides directly to 
Shae
’s mansion. He finds her
listening to 
a singer
, and has the man expelled and sworn to silence. When one of the 
begging brothers
 appears, Shae
recognizes him as Lord Varys. The Spider informs Tyrion that 
Storm's End
 has fallen and that 
Stannis
 will soon be
marching on 
King's Landing
. Tyrion bids Varys to wait at the stables while he talks to Shae.
Once alone, Shae asks Tyrion to make her his lady in court, and even suggests he kill Cersei, but Tyrion tells her,
"The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men."
 When Tyrion proposes to take her
to the 
Red Keep
 and hide her in the kitchens, Shae balks, and mocks him for being afraid of 
his father
. Tyrion slaps
her in the face, telling her never to mock him again. Feeling remorseful, he tells her the story of 
Tysha
 and his
father’s wrath. He departs to meet Varys at the stables, and the eunuch suggests that Shae be placed as a maidservant
to Lady 
Tanda
’s daughter 
Lollys
. Shae would then be able to access the 
Tower of the Hand
 through a secret passage,
which Tyrion is surprised to learn exists.
Varys then attempts to tell Tyrion how Ser 
Cortnay
 died, and when he suggests it was magic, Tyrion disbelieves
him. Varys recounts the story of how he came to be a eunuch: that he was a member of a mummers’ troupe, and that
one day in 
Myr
 a certain man bought Varys from his master. The sorcerer castrated Varys, and burned the parts,
creating a blue flame from which a voice spoke in a language he didn’t comprehend. Varys claims he has hated
magic since that day, and means to see Stannis dead if the man practiced magic.
Tyrion is somewhat skeptical, beliving it more likely that Stannis has hired a skilled assassin from the 
Free Cities
,
musing on how he used to dream of being rich enough one day to hire a 
Faceless Man
 to kill his sister. Tyrion's
greater concern is that Stannis is now bringing his army to bear against King's Landing, and he is the only one
standing in the way of Stannis's victory. With the city's people's hatred for 
House Lannister
 and himself in particular
at its highest, defeating Stannis seems unlikely.

Synopsis
Catelyn
 reflects on how she has always done her duty, remembering that she never comforted 
Littlefinger
 after
Brandon
 had injured him, nor did she bid him farewell when 
her father
 sent him off. Later, Maester 
Vyman
 shows
her a letter from Lord 
Elwood Meadows
, the new castellan at 
Storm's End
. The man does not make note of 
Edric
Storm
, and she wonders again why 
Stannis
 is so interested in the boy, thinking he might mean to use the boy’s
appearance as proof of 
Joffrey
’s ill heritage. Catelyn is considering the nature of bastards and their fathers, and
recalls 
Roose Bolton
’s recent missive where he calls his bastard, 
Ramsay Snow
, a boy of tainted blood and that he
counts himself "well rid of him". Bolton states that he hopes 
Robb
 will weigh his capture of 
Harrenhal
 against the
crimes of his bastard son.
Catelyn is drawn away as fighting begins across the 
Red Fork
, yet each time Lord 
Tywin
’s troops attempt to cross,
Edmure
’s men repel them, raining arrows down upon them as they attempt to ford the river. Catelyn is unimpressed
despite the victory her brother has won against one of the most famous battlefield commanders alive. She sends
wine to 
Cleos Frey
, and then attempts to gain information from him, but the man knows little of use. All she learns
is that Ser Cleos saw only 
Sansa
 at court, and she looked drawn; Catelyn muses that either Cersei is keeping 
Arya
hidden for fear of what she might say or do, or her younger daughter is dead. Catelyn does consider 
Tyrion
 a man
who might be trusted at his word, despite what has transpired between the two of them. She then learns the results of
the great victory, that 
Leo Lefford
 has drowned, 
Gregor Clegane
 was badly wounded, and the great knight
Strongboar
 taken captive. Yet despite the fact that they were winning, she is still afraid.

his brother
 can
smell something wrong in the air. The direwolf desperately tries to escape from the godswood, but the gate is
locked, so tries to climb a tree to reach the wall, following Bran’s thoughts. Summer falls from the tree, and Bran
awakes with a sore shoulder to find a strange man in his room, followed by 
Theon Greyjoy
. Theon, calling himself a
prince, tells him that the castle is his now, that his 
ironmen
 swam the moat and unlocked the postern gate. His
father’s former ward informs him that he must make the people of

The sea has come to Winterfell

refuses to bend the knee. Most in the castle defy Theon, but 
Reek

Jaqen H'ghar

Synopsis
Arya
 and 
Hot Pie
 are eating tarts in the kitchens when the 
Bloody Mummers
 return, this time with nearly 100
northmen
 as prisoners, along with their lord commander, 
Robett Glover
, and 
Aenys Frey
. 
Vargo Hoat
 claims that
Lord 
Roose Bolton
 fled with his host after the battle. Ser 
Amory Lorch
 has the men imprisoned in the 
Widow's
Tower
. Arya tries to convince 
Gendry
 to help her free the northmen, but the apprentice smith is happy enough where
he is and wants no part of it. Arya later goes to the 
godswood
 to practise with a wooden stick, and she meets 
Jaqen
H'ghar
 there. The 
Lorathi
 tells her he would have done with his promise, and asks her to name a third. He also
knows her to be Arya Stark, and tells her that some people have many names. She asks him to help her free the
northmen, but Jaqen reminds her that she has only one name left. When Arya asks if she could name anybody, even
the king
, Jaqen tells her, "Speak the name, and death will come. On the morrow, at the turn of the moon, a year from
this day, it will come. A man does not fly…but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there, and a
king dies." Arya whispers "Jaqen H’ghar", and stuns the man. But Jaqen is unafraid, and a dagger appears in his
hand, telling her she would lose her only friend. Arya says that a friend would help her, and Jaqen agrees to help her
if she names another name. They go and find 
Rorge
 and 
Biter
, and Jaqen tells her, "The hungry gods will feast on
blood tonight, if a man would do this thing", but Arya is resolute.
Jaqen brings Arya along, and has her demand several kettles of hot soup from the cooks. Each man takes one of the
huge kettles, with Rorge carrying two, and they invade the tower where the prisoners are kept. Boiling soup flies
everywhere as the guards are dispatched, and when Rorge unlocks the door to the cells, Robett Glover thanks them
and asks if they are from the Brave Companions. Arya is confused, but has no time to ask him what he meant when
fighting breaks out in the great castle. Jaqen wipes blood from his sword on Arya’s shift, telling her this is her work.
Later, Arya takes back the name, and asks if she still can name a third, but Jaqen responds that she has gotten far
more than three deaths. As she watches, Jaqen tells her the debt is paid and that he must die, and his features change
as he passes a hand over his face. Arya asks who he is and if she could learn to do the same, but Jaqen tells her she
would need to go with him across the 
narrow sea
. He leaves her with a coin, of great value in the right place, and
tells her that if she ever needs to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from 
Braavos
, and say 
"
valar
morghulis
"
. Jaqen, who claims his name is as dead as Arry, then disappears into the night.
Lord Roose Bolton arrives in the aftermath of the 
fall of Harrenhal
, and Vargo Hoat turns the castle over to him. The
prisoners were all a ruse to begin with, and apparently Bolton had bought the services of the Qohorik sellsword. As
Roose Bolton takes control of the castle, 
Shagwell
 grabs Arya and presents her to her brother 
Robb's
 bannerman as
the weasel who made the soup. Bolton asks her name, and Arya tells him ‘Nan’. The Lord of the 
Dreadfort
 then asks
if she is afraid of leeches, for he claims that a man must purge himself of bad blood. When Arya tells him she is not
afraid, Bolton names her his cupbearer. The banners over the gatehouse are changed to the flayed man of the
Dreadfort and the direwolf of the 
Starks
. Arya watches as the Bloody Mummers parade Ser Amory around naked,
then feed him to a caged bear, and she thinks to herself, a bear all in black, like 
Yoren
.

Daenerys Targaryen
 enters the 
House of the Undying
, where she experiences many visions. She reaches the
audience chamber of the Undying Ones, who give her cryptic information and then try to consume her. 
Drogon
rescues her and she runs outside, where 
Pyat Pree
 tries to attack her, but Drogon comes to her help once again.
Synopsis
Daenerys stands before the 
House of the Undying
. 
Drogon
 hisses at the gray and ancient ruin and most of her
companions, Ser 
Jorah
, 
Jhogo
, 
Aggo
, and 
Xaro
, tell her she should turn back, but she is resolute to enter the abode
of the Warlocks. 
Pyat Pree
 steps out to her, saying that Daenerys must enter alone, or not at all. He leads her to the
entrance, warning her to always take the door to her right, and only take stairs leading up. On her way she will see
visions of the past, future and days that never were, and those that will speak to her from other rooms, but she must
not enter any room and keep her path until she reaches the Undying's audience chamber.
At the entrance, Daenerys drinks a glass of 
shade of the evening
 a dwarf gives her, to prepare her for the truths
within, and enters. In the House of the Undying, she notices right away that she is in the presence of sorcery.
Fortunately, she brought 
Drogon
 with her into the Warlocks' home. Daenerys sees a great many visions during her
journey through the halls:
1
. 
A beautiful naked woman sprawling on a floor with four little men with rat-like faces raping her.
2
. 
A feast of corpses, a room full of savagely slaughtered bodies, and many of the corpses have cups or spoons in
their hands; above them sits a dead man on a throne with the head of a wolf, wearing an iron crown and holding
a leg of lamb like a king would hold a scepter;
3
. 
old, dead, loyal Ser 
Willem Darry
 beckons her into the house with the 
red door
, in 
Braavos
4
. 
An old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says "Let him be
the king of ashes";
5
. 
a 
man
 who looks like 
Viserys
, but taller and with darker eyes, who says to a 
woman
 nursing a baby, "
Aegon
…
What better name for a King… He is the Prince that was Promised, and his is the song of ice and fire"; and
when the man’s eyes meet Dany’s, he says either to her or the woman with the baby, "There must be one
more… The dragon has three heads", and he picks up a silver harp and begins to play;
6
. 
a vision of Pyat Pree telling her the visit is over, and to follow him into a garden;
7
. 
a great hall with several robed people claiming to be the Undying 
Qarth
, who tell her, "We sent the comet to
show you the way (to Qarth)… shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?", but it turns out to be
sorcery.
Finally, Daenerys comes upon a room with several figures that are no more than shadows, unbreathing, and over
them floats a human heart, blue and corrupted (these are apparently the real Undying). The figures speak inside
Dany’s head:
we know… the shape of shadows… morrows not yet made… drink from the cup of ice… drink from the cup of
fire… Mother of Dragons… Child of Three… three heads has the dragon… three fires must you light: one for
life and one for death and one to love… three mounts must you ride: one to bed and one to dread and one to
love… three treasons will you know: once for blood and once for gold and once for love… daughter of death,

slayer of lies, bride of fire…
She now sees visions in her head, floating faster and faster:
1
. 
Viserys
 dying;
2
. 
a tall lord with copper skin and silver hair bearing the banner of a fiery stallion;
3
. 
a dying prince with rubies flying from his armor whispering the name of a woman with his last breath;
4
. 
a blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who casts no shadow;
5
. 
a cloth dragon amidst a cheering crowd;
6
. 
a great stone beast flying from a smoking tower, breathing shadow fire;
7
. 
her Silver horse given to her by 
Drogo
 at her wedding;
8
. 
a corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, smiling sadly;
9
. 
a blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice;
10
. 
shadows dancing in a tent;
11
. 
a little girl running toward a house with a red door;
12
. 
Mirri Maz Duur
 shrieking in the flames as a dragon bursts from her;
13
. 
a corpse being dragged behind a silver horse;
14
. 
a white lion running through grass taller than a man;
15
. 
a line of naked crones emerging from a lake, kneeling before Daenerys beneath the 
Mother of Mountains
;
16
. 
ten thousand slaves crying "Mother" as Daenerys rides by on her silver.
At this point, the visions turn to a nightmare as the Undying try to consume Dany, and she is helpless to stop them
until Drogon starts to tear the corrupted heart to pieces. Fleeing from the burning House of the Undying, Pyat Pree
attacks her with a dagger, but Drogon interrupts him long enough for Daenerys to hear 
Jhogo
’s whip crack, and then
she is in the arms of Ser 
Jorah
.

Synopsis
Tyrion
 dispatches his clansmen into the 
kingswood
 to raid 
Stannis
's baggage trains, ambush his scouts, and perform
night raids. Tyrion feels he can trust only about a quarter of the 6,000 men in the 
City Watch
, and feels unprepared
for the coming battle. He orders 
Bronn
 to start burning down the houses along the wall by the quay, feeling that the
enemy could scale the wall easier by climbing on the roofs of the houses. Tyrion is aware that 
Winterfell
 has fallen
to the 
ironmen
. 
Balon Swann
 has been named to the Kingsguard to replace 
Preston Greenfield
, and Tyrion approves,
but he does not approve of Cersei’s choice of 
Osmund Kettleblack
 to replace 
Boros Blount
. Blount was stripped of
his white cloak after he surrendered 
Tommen
 immediately when 
Jacelyn
’s men overtook them. Blount is rotting in
Rosby
’s dungeon on the count of treason, since the Kingsguard are supposed to give their lives in defending the
royal family.
Tyrion has appointed the new 
High Septon
, and tells him to warn the people that Stannis means to burn the 
Great
Sept of Baelor
. Tyrion is also visited by 
Hallyne
 the Pyromancer from the 
Alchemists' Guild
, and is surprised to
learn that they have 13,000 jars of 
wildfire
, way ahead of schedule. When Tyrion asks why, the pyromancer explains
that their spells have been more potent of late, but is at a loss to explain why. He does ask Tyrion if there are any
dragons
 about, and elaborates something he heard a long time ago, that magic began to disappear from the world
when the last dragon died.
Jacelyn informs Tyrion that Tommen is safe, but the Hand does not know where the boy is being kept in case Tyrion
is captured and tortured by the invaders. 
Varys
 then informs Tyrion of a plot by several merchants calling
themselves 
Antler Men
 to arm commoners in the streets. Tyrion writes the order for their arrest, one of them being
the master smith 
Salloreon
.

Theon Greyjoy
 discovers that 
Bran
 and 
Rickon Stark
 have gone missing from 
Winterfell
 with their 
direwolves
, the
wildling
 woman 
Osha
, 
Hodor
, and the two 
Reeds
, 
Meera
 and 
Jojen
. He organizes a hunt to find them, but grows
desperate during the hunt when no trace of Bran and Rickon can be found. When the sun finally goes down, 
Reek
offers Theon a solution to his problem.
Synopsis
Theon suddenly wakes up in Eddard Stark’s former bedroom with the girl 
Kyra
 sleeping next to him. He tries to
calm himself, but as he cannot remember dreaming, he cannot put it down to a bad dream. He gets out of bed, opens
the window and looks outside, where all is quiet. He goes back to bed, until he realizes which sound is missing: the
direwolves
. He sends 
Urzen
, who is guarding at his door, to check up on the direwolves, who have been locked up in
the 
godswood
. Recalling the day the direwolves had torn the 
wildlings
 who had attacked 
Bran Stark
 in the
wolfwood, the idea of the direwolves running around makes him feel queasy. He wakes up 
Wex Pyke
, who is
sleeping by the bed, and sends him to check if Bran and 
Rickon Stark
 are still in their beds. Wex returns with the
news that the two Starks are gone. As Theon finishes dressing, Urzen returns to tell him that the wolves are gone as
well.
Theon gives the order to rouse the castle. As the order is being carried out, he wonders whether 
Stygg
 has reached
Deepwood Motte
 yet, knowing that his sister 
Asha
 might be on her way to Winterfell by now. The people of
Winterfell are gathered in the yard. Theon angrily thinks that he tried to treat them justly, but that they have repaid
him with betrayal.
Urzen and Black Lorren show Theon that 
Squint
 and 
Drennan
, who had been guarding the Hunter’s Gate, have been
killed. He recognizes Squint’s wounds as having been the work of the direwolves. He surmises that Drennan has
been killed by “the woman”, and realizes she must have had help from someone who freed the wolves. He thinks to
himself that he should have killed the direwolves the day he took the castle. He decides to search for the wolves at
daylight.
In the yard, where 
Reek
 informs him that six people are missing: Bran, Rickon, 
Meera
 and 
Jojen Reed
, 
Hodor
 and
Osha
. Learning 
Dancer
 is still in the stables, Theon realizes they escaped on foot, and that they would be slowed
down by the fact that Bran would be in the basker on Hodor’s back and that Osha would need to carry Rickon.
Theon confronts the people of Winterfell, who do not answer his questions.
Reek suggests skinning them, but Theon loudly declares there will be no flaying in the 
north
 while he rules
Winterfell, hoping some of the people at Winterfell will understand that he is the only thing protecting them from
people like Reek.
Theon organizes a hunt on Bran and Rickon, ordering Maester Luwin to accompany them because he does not dare
to leave Luwin behind in the castle. Little Walder Frey asks to come too, which Theon allows. They leave the castle
with eleven men, two boys, and twelve dogs. Reek takes a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack with
him, but Theon does not inquire as to its contents. The tracks of the drivewolves, Hodor, and the two Reeds are
easily found and the dogs find the scent. They venture northwest, into the heart of the wolfswood. Theon considers

that they might be fleeing to Deepwood Motte, unaware that Asha will be occupying the castle. He bitterly thinks to
himself that he’d sooner see them all dead, believing it is better to be seen as cruel than foolish.
Maester Luwin asks Theon to consider being merciful, not only to Bran and Rickon, but also the Reeds, citing their
value as a hostage against Lord 
Howland Reed
. Theon agrees to spare them all, including Hodor, if he can, but not
Osha, who took an oath and broke it.
They find the remains of a freshly killed young elk, clearly killed by the direwolves. Theon realizes that the animal
has only been eaten off by the wolves, and that Osha has not even cut off a few steaks. He asks Farlen if the dogs
could be tracking the wrong wolves, but Farlen denies the possibility.
They continue, but the dogs lose the scent less than an hour later, at a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains.
They are unable to determine where the wolves left the stream. Wex alerts them to the fact that there are only
pawprints visible, but not the prints of men, meaning the wolves entered the water alone. Theon is horrified at the
discovery, realizing that Osha likely send the wolves ahead on their own. He sends Gariss, Murch, Aggar, and four
dogs to double back and find where the group must have parted from the wolves, while the others follow the
direwolves, as they would not part from Bran and Rickon for long. He takes Wex, the Frey boy, and Gynir Rednose
with him upstream. They search on both sides of the stream, but Theon feels forced to give up at midday, when they
still have not found a sign of them. They reunite with Farlen’s search party, which had travelled downsteam, who
bare the same bad news. Gariss, Murch, and Aggar, having retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell, have not been
able to find any sign of the Starks either.
Theon does not dare to admit defeat and suggests returning to the brook again. Little Walder Frey believes they are
unable to find the Stark children because the Reeds are with them, citing numerous superstitions on “mudmen”. All
men laugh at the notion, until Luwin cites how the histories say the crannogmen had once been close to the 
children
of the forest
, suggesting they may have secret knowledge. Regardless, they return to the steam and search for many
a mile, but when the last daylight fades, they are forced to abandon the search. Reek approaches Theon, suggesting
that the Starks have travelled northeast, in the direction of the Umbers. However, Reek states, the children would
need to shelter someplace closer by, and he might know where that is, mentioning the old mill on 
Acorn Water
.
Although Theon questions why the Starks would have gone to hide there, with so many other possibilities nearby,
Reek insists on the location. He shows Theon the contents of his sack, and when Theon finds the wolf’s-head
brooch, he realizes what Reek is implying. He orders all but Aggar, Rednose, and Gelmarr to return to Winterfell.
Luwin asks him to remember his promice of mercy, but Theon replies that “mercy was for this morning”.

Synopsis
As 
Qhorin Halfhand
’s party moves through the 
Skirling Pass
, they note watchers high up in the pass. Qhorin sends
Stonesnake
 and Jon to dispatch the watchers, and they are warned not to let them sound a horn. Stonesnake teaches
Jon how to climb a sheer cliff face, and they eventually reach the top above the 
wildlings
. There are three, and after
killing two, the third turns out to be a woman, 
Ygritte
. She yields to them, and Jon takes her captive, despite
Stonesnake’s warning that she should be killed. When she learns that Jon is a bastard son of a Stark lord, she tells
him the wildling story of 
Bael the Bard
. Supposedly, before he joined the free folk, he was a raider, or, according to
Stonesnake, a murderer and robber.
Lord 
Brandon Stark
 wanted Bael’s head, but was never successful in capturing the bandit. To teach the lord a lesson,
Bael slipped into 
Winterfell
 calling himself Bard Sygerrik, which means ‘deceiver’ in the old tongue of the 
First
Men
, which the giants still speak. In return for his performance, he requested the fairest flower in Winterfell, and the
lord gave him the rare winter rose. In the morning, the singer was gone along with Lord Brandon’s daughter.
A year later, the lord’s daughter was found in her bedchamber with a young baby. Bael had hidden her in the crypts
of Winterfell. Thirty years later when Bael was 
King-Beyond-the-Wall
 and led the wildlings south, it was his son,
the new Stark lord, who slew Bael, since the bard would not harm his son. Upon returning home, the young lord’s
mother killed herself when she found out Bael was dead. The young lord was said to have eventually been killed by
one of his bannermen
. Jon does not believe the story, which claims that the blood of the Starks and the wildlings is
the same.
When Qhorin and the others arrive, Ygritte recognizes the Halfhand and confirms that the wildlings would kill him
if he yielded. Qhorin’s men state that she should be killed, and Qhorin leaves Jon alone with Ygritte to carry out the
task. Ygritte tells Jon that 
Mance Rayder
 would accept him if he ran off with her. Jon, about to behead her, finally
stops himself and tells her to run off.

Synopsis
Sansa
 meets again with Ser 
Dontos
 in the godswood, and learns that he hears more things as a fool than he ever did
as a knight. And 
Varys
 the Spider pays in gold for anything overheard, making Dontos believe that 
Moon Boy
 has
been working for Varys for years. Dontos tells her that 
Stannis
 burned the 
godswood
 at 
Storm's End
 at the behest of
the 
Red Woman
. When Sansa asks him to make good on his promise, Dontos tells her the time is not right for their
escape. Dontos does promise her that when his friend returns to 
King's Landing
, they will have a ship to escape on.
Sansa does not want to return to her room yet, so she goes up to the roof, where she is surprised by 
the Hound
.
Clegane is in a foul mood as ever, and tells her that he enjoys killing, and that only cowards fight with fire. He
claims he fears no man, but Sansa thinks that he does fear 
his brother
. Once again, he assures her that there are no
true knights
.
That night, Sansa has a dream where she is surrounded by a mob, and calls out to all the great knights, but none
respond to her call. She feels herself bleeding, and awakes to find the sheets soaked with blood. She realizes that she
just had her first 
flowering
, and burns the sheets in fear that 
Joffrey
 will find out and want to bed her. Her maids
catch her and bring her before 
the Queen
, but Cersei comforts her, knowing the girl is frightened at the prospect of
marrying Joffrey. She tells her how difficult Joffrey was to bear, and how 
Robert
 was out hunting when Joffrey was
born. Cersei informs her that while Sansa may not love Joffrey, she will love the children she bears him. The Queen
also reveals that Robert always wanted to be loved, to have friends and be cheered, and that her brother 
Tyrion
 had
the same disease. She tells Sansa: 
"Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same."

Synopsis
Jon
 tells 
Qhorin Halfhand
 what 
Ygritte
 said to him about 
Mance Rayder
 accepting him if he ran off. Qhorin
confirms this. He knew Mance when he was a black brother, and the ranger tells Jon that Mance loved songs and
wildling
 women, and that he was a wildling captured as a child by the Watch. He was the best ranger they had, but
he returned to his roots, some say to gain a crown. Qhorin suspects that Jon let Ygritte go, and Jon confirms that he
did, however Qhorin understands that the girl was not a threat, and if he had wanted her dead he would have had
Ebben
 do it, or have done it himself. Qhorin tells Jon that he now knows him better than he did before, and that it is
important for a commander to know his men.
They travel at night and rest during the day. That morning, Jon dreams of five direwolves, when there should have
been six. Seeing through the eyes of 
Ghost
, he finds himself in a forest and senses a voice calling his name from a
nearby 
weirwood
 with a face resembling 
his brother
's, except it has three eyes. His brother explains to him how to
open his eyes, and the tree reaches down and touches him, and he finds himself back in the mountains. He is atop a
cliff, and oversees thousands of men training for combat. He also sees 
mammoths
 with 
giants
 riding them. Suddenly,
an 
eagle
 soars out of the sky coming straight for him. Jon awakens shouting Ghost’s name. The others hear his
shout, and he tells them what he saw. Qhorin calls it a wolf dream, and Ebben calls Jon a 
skinchanger
. Qhorin,
however, does not balk at the thought of wargs and giants during a time when the dead walk and the trees have eyes
again. They set out just before dusk, and spot an eagle watching them, well out of bowshot.
Soon after, they find Ghost wounded and dress the direwolf's wounds. Qhorin tells them they must head back to the
Fist
, for they have been seen by the eagle which they fear is a skinchanger as well. They begin the journey back
through the 
Skirling Pass
 without lighting any fires despite the cold. But their lead on the enemy is shortening, and
when they come upon the place where the wildlings were killed, Squire 
Dalbridge
 remains behind with all their
arrows, sacrificing himself to give the others an advantage.

Synopsis
Varys
 shows 
Tyrion
 a message from 
Winterfell
 that reveals 
Bran
 and 
Rickon
 were killed at the hands of 
Theon
Greyjoy
. Tyrion goes to tell 
Cersei
 the news, wanting very much to see her reaction. She tells him she could have
frightened Bran into silence, but 
Jaime
 reacted without thinking. Tyrion tells her that they must take good care of
Sansa
, because with two of her sons dead, Lady 
Catelyn
 might decide to kill Jaime. Cersei warns him that he trusts
Varys too much, telling him that the Spider feeds them all information to make them think they would be helpless
without him. She reveals that Varys told her Tyrion meant to take 
the Hound
 from 
Joffrey
, and Tyrion explains he
needs Sandor Clegane and Ser 
Balon Swann
 to lead sorties in the upcoming battle. Tyrion also informs her he means
to give Joffrey a small command far out of the main fighting, so that the men can see their King leading them.
Cersei then springs a surprise on Tyrion, bringing out who she thinks is Tyrion’s whore, 
Alayaya
. The girl has been
badly beaten, and the Queen reveals she did this because 
a Lannister
 always pays her debts, and Tyrion has been
conspiring against her since he arrived. Tyrion pretends to be horrified, but is relieved that his sister had not found
Shae
. Cersei tells him the whore will not be harmed so long as 
Tommen
 remains safe, but Tyrion bluffs by saying he
will have Tommen treated the same way the girl is. Alayaya does not give Tyrion away, and goes along with the
whole thing. Tyrion then threatens to pay Cersei back for what she did, when she least expects it. Having lost, the
Queen shouts at him to get out. He finds Shae in his room, having come through the secret passage, but she was
blindfolded by Varys and does not know where the entrance lies.

Synopsis
Catelyn
 hears the celebration going on in 
Riverrun
, but she sits alone with 
Brienne
 and desolate over the loss of her
two young sons. The 
raven
 arrived that morning, and Catelyn is beside herself with grief, despondent at the thought
nearly all her children are dead or lost to her. She tells Brienne that she sent 
the Kingslayer
 a bottle of 
wine
 to loosen
his tongue. She means to question him, and is perhaps contemplating having the man killed since she has so little to
live for anymore.
At midnight, Catelyn goes to interrogate Jaime, and asks Brienne to wait outside. Jaime mocks her at first, but
eventually agrees to answer her questions if she agrees to answer his. Jaime admits to being the father to all of
Cersei
’s children, and to throwing 
Bran
 out the tower window. However, Jaime denies sending the assassin after
Bran, saying, "if I wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself." Catelyn questions him about the dagger
that 
Littlefinger
 claimed 
Tyrion
 had won from him. Jaime backs what Tyrion told her in the 
Mountains of the Moon
,
that he always bets on his brother and lost at that tourney. Jaime admits that King 
Robert
 mocked him with the
dagger at the feast the night of the tourney, and Catelyn is dismayed that Littlefinger, who was like a brother to her
once, would deceive her the way he has.
Catelyn then reveals that 
Robb
 has recently taken 
the Crag
 from the 
Westerlings
, and marched ever closer to
Casterly Rock
. Jaime then steers the conversation to what really happened to 
Brandon Stark
 and Lord 
Rickard
 at the
hands of the Mad King 
Aerys
, perhaps to absolve himself of having slain the king. Brandon was on his way to
Riverrun when he learned of 
Lyanna
's disappearance, and instead went to 
King's Landing
 with a handful of friends,
all sons of prominent lords, and upon entering the 
Red Keep
, Brandon shouted for 
Rhaegar
 to "come out and die".
Rhaegar was not there to answer the challenge, and Aerys had Brandon and his men arrested for conspiring to
murder his heir. Aerys demanded the fathers of the men come to King’s Landing to answer the charges against their
sons; when they came, both fathers and sons were murdered at the command of King Aerys, with Brandon dying of
strangulation trying to reach his father who was being burnt alive by Aerys' pyromancers. Jaime was a young
member of the 
Kingsguard
 when he saw all this, and it was Ser 
Gerold Hightower
 who told him, "You swore a vow
to guard the king, not to judge him", whom everyone consider a better man than him.
Jaime, now fully drunk, angrily rants that he is reviled for what he considers his finest act and begins to mock 
Ned
Stark
’s honor, stating that unlike Ned, a man who fathered 
a bastard
, he has never been unfaithful and that Ned had
no right to judge him, the man who avenged his father and brother, but Catelyn has heard enough, and calls for
Brienne’s sword.

Theon Greyjoy
 is awoken by 
Wex Pyke
 and 
Reek
 and informed of the arrival of his sister, 
Asha
. Theon meets with
Asha, who berates him for having killed 
Bran
 and 
Rickon Stark
 and having mounted their heads upon the gates of
Winterfell
. Theon refuses to abandon his conquered seat, after which Asha leaves. As a last measure, Theon sends
Reek away with a bag of coin in search of men to defend the castle. Afterwards he has yet another nightmare, which
makes him realize all around him belongs to the Starks.
Synopsis
Theon Greyjoy
 is woken from a nightmare, in which he is being chased by 
large wolves
 with the faces of children,
by his squire, 
Wex Pyke
, with 
Reek
 standing behind him. Reek informs Theon that 
Asha
 has arrived. As Theon
prepares to see his sister, he thinks back about the nightmares he has been having lately, ever since the night he and
Reek killed the two boys at the mill. After washing his face, Theon dresses in rich clothing, only to realize that Asha
cares more for blades. He changes again, this time dressing in felted black wool and ringmail. Lastly, he dons his
crown.
Theon has taken to using guards for his own safety, while his own men have become sullen and anxious following
the murders of 
Gelmarr
, 
Aggar
, and 
Gynir
. Although the three 
ironborn
 had been killed by Reek with Theon's
permission, to ensure they would not be able to reveal what had happened at the mill the night they returned with the
corpses of the children, Theon had felt the need to blame someone for their deaths. To that end, he had executed
Farlen
, going as far as to personally execute him like 
Eddard Stark
 would have done. The memory is a sour one, as it
had taken him four difficult blows to sever Farlen's head, afterward feeling sick about it.
His men would prefer to leave 
Winterfell
, a thought that makes Theon angry. He refuses to be driven from his own
seat, being the Prince of Winterfell. He blames Asha, feeling she had taken this long to respond to his commands on
purpose. Reek, 
Urzen
 and 
Kromm
 escort Theon to the hall, where he finds Asha in the high seat of the 
Starks
. Theon
is dismayed to discover that Asha brought only twenty men. In turn, she scolds him for having killed 
Bran
 and
Rickon Stark
 and having mounted their heads upon Winterfell's gates. The memory of returning the bodies to
Winterfell is a sour one for Theon as well. He recalls forbidding 
Luwin
 from sewing the heads back onto the bodies
and placing them in the 
crypts of Winterfell
. Theon leads Asha to Eddard Stark's solar, where he tells her that
Dagmer
 has lost the fight at 
Torrhen's Square
. Asha tells him she was not surprised to learn about it, and informs
him that Dagmer is currently leading the survivors back to the 
Stony Shore
, making Theon realize that she is better
informed than he is.
Theon is furious about the fact that Asha is planning on leaving only ten of her men behind for him. 
Leobald
Tallhart
 has joined Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, Lord 
Wyman Manderly
 has sent a dozen barges upriver, and 
the Umbers
 are
gathering beyond the 
Last River
. Asha compliments her brother for the clever way he took Winterfell, but tells him
that the wise course of action would have been razing the castle and taking the two princes as hostages back to 
Pyke
.
Winterfell is too far from the sea, and every northman is now his enemy. Theon counters her, telling her that he
killed two of Eddard Stark's sons to lay to rest the ghosts of their brothers, 
Rodrik
 and 
Maron
. Asha tells him that
Rodrik might feel the need to avenge Eddard's sons and asks Theon to return with her to 
Deepwood Motte
. When
Theon refuses, Asha leaves, telling him he shall hold the castle for the remainder of his life.

Asha departs the castle with her men and Theon watches her go from atop the wall, where he is approached by Reek.
Reek offers to find Theon two hundred good men if Theon provides a horse and a bag of coin. He asks for 
Palla
 as a
reward. Although Reek makes Theon uneasy, he does not dare kill the man, as he is literate and cunning, and could
easily have left a hidden account of what they had done behind. Theon agrees to give him the girl if he can deliver
two hundred men, and Reek leaves the castle before the sun goes down. That night Theon dreams about the
welcoming feast Eddard Stark had thrown King 
Robert I Baratheon
 when the king visited Winterfell. Although the
feast is jolly at first, the room grows darker and suddenly Theon finds himself dining with the dead. Robert's guts are
spilling out on the table from a great gash in his belly, while Eddard Stark is headless. Lining the benches below are
the corpses of men he knows: 
Jory Cassel
, 
Fat Tom
, 
Porther
, 
Cayn
, 
Hullen
, and all the others who had gone south to
King's Landing
. 
Mikken
, 
Chayle
, 
Benfred Tallhart
 and his 
Wild Hares
, the miller's wife, 
Farlen
, and the 
wildling
Theon had killed to rescue Bran are among them. There are also people who Theon has never met, including
Rickard
, 
Lyanna
, and 
Brandon Stark
. Then, 
Robb Stark
 enters through the doors with 
Grey Wind
 beside him, both
of them bleeding "from half a hundred savage wounds".
Theon wakes screaming, and Wex and his guards fetch Luwin, but Theon does not dare drink the sleeping draught
that the 
maester
 leaves him. Instead, he summons 
Kyra
 and fucks her, but even that cannot help him sleep again, and
she leaves sobbing of pain. At dawn, Theon goes outside. Seeing everything belonging to the Starks around him, he
thinks to himself he should have gone with Asha. In silence, he looks at the heads mounted atop the iron spikes of
the gatehouse, reflecting on what fools people could be. Although everyone had accepted his story, the heads on the
wall actually belong to the miller's sons, who had been of an age and coloring with the two missing Starks. With
their faces flayed, no one had been able to tell the difference. Theon never found Bran and Rickon.

Sansa VI
Synopsis
Sansa
 is in the 
Red Keep
's royal sept. The 
battle of the Blackwater
 is underway and the people in the sept are
waiting for the outcome.
Joffrey
 obliged her to see him off before. He made her kiss 
his sword
 promising that he would kill 
Stannis
 with it.
Sansa hopes that Joffrey will fight himself and get himself killed. She told him that her brother 
Robb
 was always in
the thick of the fight. Joffrey replied that he will kill Robb as well.
In the sept the people are singing. Sansa sings with them until they start praying for the victory of Joffrey. Silently
Sansa prays for his defeat and goes away. As she leaves for Maegor's Holdfast she can hear the sound of battle.
Within the holdfast Sansa enters the Queen's Ballroom, where there is almost every highborn woman in the city,
along with a handful of old men and young boys. Sansa notices 
Ilyn Payne
. She asks Cersei why Ser Ilyn has come.
Cersei explains why they need him:
-
"When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him."
-
"Won't your guards protect us?"
-
And who will protect us from my guards? The queen gave 
Osfryd
 a sideways look. "Loyal sellswords
are rare as virgin whores. If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their
haste to rip them off. They'll steal what they can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women,
and stableboys, all out to save their own worthless hides. Do you have any notion what happens when
a city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn't, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers,
and there's such a dearth of good sacking songs."
-
True knights would never harm women and children. The words rang hollow in her ears even as she
said them.

True knights. The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. "No doubt you're right. So why
don't you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for 
Symeon Star-Eyes
 and Prince 
Aemon the
Dragonknight
 to come rescue you, sweetling. I'm sure it won't be very long now."

Synopsis
Davos
' ship 
Black Betha
 is in the second line on the right as 
Stannis
' great fleet, under the command of Ser 
Imry
Florent
, enters 
Blackwater Bay
. He sees that the city defenders have few enough ships, but the shore is well
fortified, and dozens of catapults and archers line the walls of the city. Davos is glad to know that Stannis sent
Melisandre
 back to 
Dragonstone
, because the king feared the commonfolk would say it was the sorceress who won
the battle.
As they pass two winch towers on either side of the headwaters of the channel entering the 
Blackwater Rush
, Davos
fears a chain boom, which he sees exists, but it is not raised. The old sailor is curious, but there is little time to
consider what it means. Fighting breaks out, and despite his inexperience, Ser Imry's battle plans seem to be working
well, until the barge with the 
wildfire
 in it explodes. The channel turns into a ruin of hundreds of ships, many
burning from the unquenchable green liquid. Davos goes overboard as hundreds of men on both sides die screaming
in the green blaze. As the mass of ships and debris begin to float back out towards the bay and Davos hopes he can
reach the open sea, he sees the great chain boom raised closing off the Blackwater Rush, turning its mouth into the
mouth of hell.

Tyrion Lannister
 watches as half of 
Stannis
' fleet is on fire in the 
Blackwater Rush
. Hundreds of people are dying in
the water. 
King Joffrey
 complains that most of his ships are ablaze, but for Tyrion there is no alternative to
sacrificing them. Some of Stannis' ships have escaped, however, releasing men in front of the city wall or waiting on
the southern shore of the Blackwater. Tyrion allows Joffrey to launch the 
Antler Men
 with the 
catapults
 into the
fray. He gets word that there is a large force attempting to batter down the 
King's Gate
. When he arrives there, he
orders 
the Hound
, who is in command, to go out with his men, but Clegane refuses. Tyrion realizes that the man is
afraid of the wildfire and he is forced to rally the troops himself, leading a sortie through the gate to stop Stannis'
men.
Synopsis
Tyrion Lannister
, standing on top of the 
Mud Gate
, watches motionlessly as half of 
Stannis'
 fleet is ablaze in the
Blackwater Rush
, along with most of 
King Joffrey's
 ships. It seems like the river itself is on fire. The air is full of
smoke, arrows and screams. The wildfire is drifting downstream towards ships that desperately, but futilely, try to
escape. The low-hanging clouds reflect the green glow, creating an eerily beautiful scenery. Tyrion is reminded of
dragon fire and wonders whether he feels the same way as 
Aegon the Conqueror
 did when he watched the 
Field of
Fire
. He is captivated and can't turn away, although he realizes that this is only half a victory and that the
celebrations of the 
Gold Cloaks
 behind him are premature.
Tyrion sees another ship loaded with wildfire exploding and has to shield his eyes. Hundreds of people are dying in
the water, either burning to death or drowning. He thinks of Stannis, who might be sitting on his warhorse among
the mass of people on the southern bank of the Blackwater, watching the same spectacle. Tyrion hears King Joffrey,
huddled among his guards on the wallwalk below, complaining about the fate of his fleet, as the 
Kingslander
, 
Queen
Cersei
 and 
Loyal Man
 are already burning and the 
Seaflower
 is about to be engulfed by flames as well. He advises
his nephew that there was no alternative to sacrificing the own fleet, thinking by himself that Stannis would have
sensed the trap, if the royal fleet had not come forward for battle. 
Bronn
's position under the 
Red Keep
 is too far
away for Tyrion to see anything, but the sellsword must have set the oxen into motion the second Stannis' flagship
had passed and the enormously heavy chain was pulled up by the winches, creating a barrier that now prevents most
ships from escaping the wildfire inferno.
Some do, though, as Tyrion observes with dismay. While the main channel of the Blackwater is all aflame, the north
and south banks are not, as the wildfire has not spread as evenly Tyrion hoped it would. A good part of Stannis'
ships have made for the southern side of the Blackwater, from where they can bring the enemy troops across later
on, while at least eight ships have already landed under the city wall, putting men ashore there. Stannis' main host
might need some time to regain their courage after watching the jade holocaust that has absorbed so many of their
fellows, but when they start to attack again, the risk of the city forces breaking will be acute, as Lord 
Jacelyn
Bywater
 has warned Tyrion. Seeing shapes moving among the charred ruins of the city wharves, he sends order to
Lord Jacelyn to make another sortie against soldiers stumbling ashore.
He also commands Ser 
Arneld
 to swing the 
Three Whores
 thirty degrees west. King Joffrey brings up that his
mother has promised him that he could use the catapults and Tyrion allows him to go through with his plan for the
Antler Men
. When they were brought before the King for justice, Joffrey promised them that he would send them

back to Stannis. The traitors are now naked and trussed up in the square, antlers nailed to their heads, and Joffrey
intends to catapult the bodies over the city wall in Stannis' direction. Tyrion tells Joffrey to proceed swiftly, as the
Great Whores will be needed for other things soon. As the happy King is about to leave, escorted by members of the
Kingsguard
, Tyrion orders Ser 
Osmund Kettleblack
 that they should keep Joffrey safe under any circumstance but
also keep him among the defenders. He wonders whether 
Cersei
 will be true to her promise of protecting 
Alayaya
the way he protects Cersei's wretched bastard son.
Tyrion gets word that hundreds of enemies have landed on the tourney grounds and prepare for battering down the
King's Gate
 with a ram. He curses, hurries to his horse and, followed by 
Podrick Payne
 and Ser 
Mandon Moore
,
gallops through the 
River Row
, kept clear of traffic on Tyrion's command to allow movement between the gates,
towards the King's Gate. When he arrives there, the ram is already in place outside and crashing against the wood.
Some of the defenders on the gatehouse square are wounded, but Tyrion spots a good many sellswords and knights
who are not, and he orders another sortie, asking who is in charge.
Sandor Clegane
 steps forward and objects to Tyrion's order, dropping his helmet to the ground. His face is covered
in blood from a gash on his forehead and his left ear is sheared off. Tyrion insists on a sortie, but the Hound tells
him to bugger that and bugger himself. A sellsword seconds Clegane, explaining that three sorties left half of the
men wounded or dead. Tyrion sarcastically asks him whether he thinks he has been hired to fight in a tourney. He
repeats his order, addressing the Hound in particular, but then is shocked to notice that Clegane is actually scared.
He changes his tactics and tries to coax the men into action, but Clegane is adamant that he will not lead the men
into the fire again. He suggests to open the gate instead and kill the enemies when they rush inside. Ser Mandon
advises him to obey the order of the 
Hand of the King
, but the Hound just curses Tyrion some more, then asks for
wine.
Clegane's face is white as milk and Tyrion thinks he's dead on feet, worn out by the battle and his terror of fire. Even
worse, the Hound's fear has shaken the will of those he commands. Tyrion is looking around for another man to put
in charge, but dimisses his own idea of using Ser Mandon, as he remembers a comment by his brother 
Jaime
 that Ser
Mandon is not the kind of man others would follow. He hears another crash of the ram and announces that he will
lead the sortie himself, thinking to himself that this is madness but madness is better than defeat. The Hound laughs
at the suggestion with contempt, but Tyrion gives orders to prepare the attack. However, only twenty men respond to
his call while the others follow Clegane's example. Sitting on his horse with helmet and shield, Tyrion addresses the
holdouts: "They say I'm only half a man. What does that make the lot of you?"
He manages to shame them by suggesting they are less than a dwarf if they refuse to fight the enemies. Within a few
moments, twice as many men respond to Tyrion's orders. He announces:
"You won’t hear me shout out Joffrey’s name. [...] You won’t hear me yell for 
Casterly Rock
 either. This is
your city Stannis means to sack, and that’s your gate he’s bringing down. So come with me and kill the son of a
bitch!"
Tyrion unshields his axe and trots towards the sally point. He thinks the men are following him, but he doesn't dare
to look around and check whether they really do.

Synopsis
Tyrion
, with Ser 
Balon Swann
 and Ser 
Mandon Moore
 at his side, is cutting through 
Stannis
’s forces. He is
confused to see such a large force of men to the west, seemingly fighting Stannis’s men, and can’t figure out where
they came from. But he has little time to consider it, as he sees hundreds of Stannis’s troops crossing the 
Blackwater
by using the half-sunk ships as a bridge. Racing onto the boats, Tyrion’s men are overwhelmed, and he goes over the
edge of a gunwale, clinging for his life. Ser Mandon Moore appears and tells Tyrion to take his hand, his left hand.
As Tyrion reaches for his hand, he instinctively withdraws as Ser Mandon’s sword slices into his face. Tyrion,
grievously wounded, watches as 
Podrick Payne
 saves his life by shoving Ser Mandon into the river.

Sansa
 watches as Lancel falls to his knees, severely
injured. She attempts to calm Cersei's guests and orders others to help Lancel receive medical care.
Dontos
 persuades her to lock herself in her room, and when Sansa arrives at her chambers, she finds 
Sandor Clegane
hiding in the shadows. The Hound, drunk and battered from the fighting, tells her he lost, and that he should have
killed

forces her to look at him, and then tells her, "I could keep you safe…No one would hurt you again, or I’d kill them."
Sandor then asks that she sing for him, as she had promised she would. She is too frightened to remember the words
of the song he wants, and can only sing the

Mace Tyrell

Renly
 who slew
Ser 
Guyard Morrigen

Synopsis
Dany
 considers the defeat of the Undying to be 
Drogon
’s victory. However, 
Xaro
, whose guest she is, warns her that
the 
Warlocks
 are gathering their power to come for her, and that the other two great merchant consortiums want her
either expelled from 
the city
, or killed outright. Dany realizes she must flee, for Xaro’s protection can only go so far.
The merchant again asks her to marry him, but this time Dany learns that what Xaro really wants is one of the
dragons. Dany tells him that it would cost one-third of all the ships in the world in order for her to give up one of her
dragons. Xaro leaves, and Dany questions Ser 
Jorah
 about some of the mysteries she saw in the 
House of the
Undying
. Jorah says that the three heads of the dragon represent 
Aegon
 and his two sisters, but Dany is not
convinced. The knight confirms that 
Rhaegar
 did play a silver harp, but he says that if the 
Prince’s son
 was the
promised one in the vision, the infant Aegon was killed during the 
sack of King's Landing
. Jorah has no knowledge
of the song of ice and fire.
Dany later sets out with the exiled knight and her bloodriders to find ships to take her from Qarth. Along the docks,
Jorah warns her that a big, scarred man and an old man with a staff are following them. When a merchant hands her
a beautiful box as a gift, Dany opens it to find a green scarab within. The creature within the box flies out, and
mayhem erupts. The creature would have bit Dany had the old man with the staff not knocked it out of her hands.
The merchant was a 
Sorrowful Man
, and the creature a 
manticore
 that would have killed Dany had it bitten her.
They learn that the huge, scarred eunuch is the pit-fighter Strong 
Belwas
, and the old man is his squire 
Arstan
Whitebeard
, both sent by Magister 
Illyrio Mopatis
 to return them to 
Pentos
. The old man recognizes Mormont, and
the exile recognizes him but cannot place a name. Arstan claims he comes from the 
Seven Kingdoms
, and squired
for a knight of 
House Swann
 as a young man. The two claim that Illyrio sent for them because he wishes to have her
dragons in order to bring justice to the Seven Kingdoms, which are a divided and warring realm. Dany concedes that
she must leave Qarth, but commands them to change the names of their three ships to that of Aegon’s three dragons.

Synopsis
After aiding in the capture of 
Harrenhal
 
Arya
 is now serving Lord 
Roose Bolton
. She is bothered by the killing and
head-staking of many of the servants who worked for Lord 
Tywin
, most of them inherited from Lady 
Shella Whent
who held Harrenhal prior to Lord Tywin. Arya does not wish to reveal herself to the Lord of the 
Dreadfort
, even
though she knows the man to be one of 
Robb
’s banner-men.
Arya overhears a meeting between Bolton and his advisors, mainly 
Freys
. The Freys believe that Robb will lose, and
that they should sue for peace and leave Harrenhal. Bolton states that he is not a man to be undone, like 
Stannis
Baratheon
 was. Arya learns that 
Winterfell
 has fallen and is horrified when she finds out that her brothers are dead.
Bolton dismisses the Freys, and has Arya remove the leeches.
Qyburn
 reads a letter from the Lady 
Walda
, Bolton’s new wife. Bolton orders the letter burned, and a message sent
to 
Helman Tallhart
, who had recently taken 
Darry
 from the 
Lannisters
. Bolton orders him and 
Robett Glover
 to burn
the castle and put the people within to the sword in the name of King Robb, and then to strike east for 
Duskendale
.
Bolton says that both men will wish vengeance for what has transpired to their families and homes in 
the North
.
Bolton then announces that he will hunt wolves that day, for he cannot sleep with all the howling at night. That
evening, Bolton returns with nine dead wolves, and tells Arya that he means to give Harrenhal to 
Vargo Hoat
 when
he returns to the north. Arya is to remain at Harrenhal to serve the Goat. Outside the tower occupied by the Freys,
she hears much shouting within and sees 
Elmar
 crying on the steps. The young son of Lord 
Walder Frey
 says,
"We’ve been dishonored. There was a bird from the Twins. My lord father says I’ll need to marry someone else."
Elmar was promised a princess originally, but whether or not he knows it to be Arya is unknown.
Arya then decides to flee 
Harrenhal
, and eventually convinces 
Gendry
 and 
Hot Pie
 to come with her that night. They
meet at the 
Tower of Ghosts
, Gendry says the postern gate is guarded, and Arya says she will get rid of the guard.
She approaches him openly and tells him that Lord Roose has her giving a silver piece to all the guards for their
service. She takes out the coin Jaqen gave her and drops it, when the guard reach for it, she slits his throat and the
three ride out through a sally port and away from Harrenhal.

House Lannister
 during the 
Battle of the Blackwater
, with over
600 new knights made. Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 is named a member of Joffrey’s 
Kingsguard
, and 
Margaery
 is betrothed to
Joffrey. With this, Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey is ended, to her great relief. 
Mace Tyrell

Many of the great lords sworn to 
Casterly Rock

freeriders as well. 
Lothor Brune

Fossoways

As

 is being besieged, 
Theon Greyjoy
 declines Maester 
Luwin
's suggestion of yielding. Theon parleys
with Ser 
Rodrik Cassel
, using Rodrik's daughter 
Beth
 as a hostage. Theon knows that the host will attack regardless
of his threat of Beth and considers Luwin's suggestion of requesting 
taking the black
 until he is informed that the
northmen are 
fighting among each other
. Newly arrived 
men from the Dreadfort
 slaughter Rodrik's host, and Theon
is shocked to discover that they are being led by "Reek", who reveals himself to be 
Ramsay Bolton
. Ramsay knocks
Theon to the ground and orders 
Winterfell to be sacked
.
Synopsis
Theon Greyjoy
 is approached by Maester 
Luwin
, who advices him to yield. 
Victarion
 and 
Balon Greyjoy
 have not
replied to Theon's messages, and although new birds will not reach them on time, Theon orders Luwin to send them
anyway. He accuses Luwin of wanting him dead. The maester calmly explains that, although he bears Theon no
great love, his 
order
] serves and the fact that Theon holds Winterfell means that Luwin is bound to serve him. Again,
he counsels Theon to yield 
Winterfell
, as he has no hope of holding it. Theon counters that by holding onto
Winterfell, 
Rodrik Cassel
 cannot turn south to take Victarion in the rear. He is willing to withstand a siege of a year,
but Luwin tells him that within days the northmen will be climbing the walls in more places than Theon can stop
them.
Theon has his 
ironborn
 assemble in the yard. He informs his men he will not run from the northmen, and gives them
the option of leaving him or dying beside him. None of his men reply, until 
Wex Pyke
 steps over to Theon's side.
Lorren
, 
Red Rolfe
, 
Kromm
, 
Werlag
, 
Tymor
 and his three brothers, 
Ulf the Ill
, 
Harrag Sharp
, four 
Harlaws
 and two
Botleys
, and 
Kenned
 the Whale follow. The others leave. Black Lorren counsels him to put the castle folk to the
sword, as they will turn on them as soon as the fighting begins. Garbed for battle, Theon climbs the watchtower and
watches the northmen who have gathered. Despite his disapproval about the plan, Lorren goes to fetch 
Beth Cassel
.
After 
Cley Cerwyn
 announces Ser Rodrik Cassel's wish to parley with Theon, Theon goes to the drawbridge. Theon
meets them in the market square, where Rodrik demands Theon return Winterfell to the 
Starks
, command his men to
lay down their weapons, and allow himself to be judged by 
Robb Stark
. Theon gives Rodrik his own terms, telling
the 
knight
 that the northmen are to disperse and to swear fealthy to Balon Greyjoy as their king and Theon as the
Prince of Winterfell. He then signals Lorren, who produces Rodrik's daughter Beth with a noose around her neck
atop the walls of Winterfell. When Rodrik accuses Theon of being craven, Theon tells him that he felt the noose for
ten years. He declines Rodrik's offer of taking his daughter's place, informing the knight that she will hang if the
northern army is still present at sunset. Every following dawn and dusk, he says, another hostage will follow.
Theon returns to the castle and retreats to 
Eddard Stark
's bedroom. He knows that the northmen will attack and that
Winterfell will easily fall. Finding no solace in 
wine
, Theon takes his bow to the inner ward, where he loses shafts at
archery butts. He sees no way out: if he hangs Beth, the northern army will attack at once; But if he does not hang
her, he will prove his threats are empty. Luwin approaches him, suggesting Theon take the black. Theon considers
the option, realizing it is a way to live with dignity and honor. They are interrupted by Kromm, who informs them
that men from the 
Dreadfort
 have arrived, who are now fighting Rodrik's army.

After the 
battle at Winterfell
 ends, the leader of the Dreadfort men presents Theon with the corpses of Rodrik
Cassel, Cley Cerwyn, and 
Leobald Tallhart
, and Theon orders Winterfell’s gates to be opened to their new friends.
The Dreadfort leader, Red Helm, informs Theon that Rodrik thought the Dreadfort men were allies to the other
northmen, which allowed the Dreadfort to win the battle despite being outnumbered five-to-one. He takes off his
helm and Theon identifies him as Reek. The man tells Theon that Reek is dead; His name is Ramsay Snow, although
he prefers Ramsay Bolton. Reek had been killed while fleeing the northern soldiers who had captured Ramsay, but
as they had exchanged clothes, no one had realized the switch of identity. Ramsay tells Theon that he was promised
a prize
 for bringing two hundred men, but brought more than promised by bringing six hundred. Instead of Palla, he
prefers Theon's bedwarmer Kyra. When Theon objects, Ramsay punches Theon to the face and Theon falls to the
ground in pain. The Dreadfort men attack the ironborn, and Theon sees Red Rolfe, Kenned, Ulf, and Luwin die,
while the roof of the stables are set aflame. Ramsay orders his men to "save me 
the Freys
 and burn the rest. Burn it,
burn it all." The last thing Theon sees during the 
sack of Winterfell
 is his horse 
Smiler
 escaping the stables afire.

Synopsis
Tyrion
 lies abed dreaming of the men who died fighting alongside him in 
the battle
, as well as those he killed. He
dreams of 
Tysha
 as well, and when he awakens, realizes that he is not at the 
Tower of the Hand

hovering over him is one he does not recognize. Unable to speak, the maester gives him

Maester 
Ballabar
 keeps mumbling about

and looks upon his destroyed face in a mirror. Three-quarters of his nose is gone along with part of his lip, and the

Podrick Payne

Synopsis
The weather in the 
Skirling Pass
 has gotten worse. 
Qhorin
 sends 
Ebben
 back with the last garron to reach the 
Lord
Commander
 with all haste, while the rest try to head off pursuit. Watched by the eagle, Qhorin then sends
Stonesnake
 back as well, to take the high passes to reach the 
Fist of the First Men
. Qhorin commands Stonesnake to
tell Mormont all that 
Jon
 saw: that he faces giants and wargs and worse, and that the trees have eyes again. That
night, the Halfhand asks Jon if his sword is sharp, and makes the young man recite his oath with him. Qhorin then
commands Jon to yield when they are overtaken, and not to balk no matter what the wildlings ask him to do to prove
himself. Jon is appalled at the suggestion, but Qhorin tells him to go among the 
Wildlings
 and learn what they plan,
watch what they do, but to remember who he is and to return to Mormont when he has learned what the wildlings
are searching for. Qhorin promises to tell the Lord Commander that Jon never broke his oath when he sees him
again.
They are overtaken soon after by 
Rattleshirt
 and a party of wildlings, 
Ygritte
 amongst them. They have Ebben’s
head, and Rattleshirt orders them killed. Jon yields, as Qhorin ordered him to, and the Halfhand says in contempt, "I
was warned bastard blood is craven." Rattleshirt commands Jon to kill Qhorin to prove himself. Jon slays the big
ranger only after 
Ghost
 gives him an opening by biting the man’s calf. The wildlings accept him despite Rattleshirt’s
misgivings, and Ygritte tells him that the eagle was once 
the man
 he killed up in the passes when they captured her.

Synopsis
Jojen
 wakes 
Bran
 from a wolf dream, and warns him that he's spending too much time as 
Summer
, and that while
the wolf eats in the dreams, Bran does not. Bran informs them that 
Winterfell
 has been burned to the ground and is
all ash except for the stone walls. They have been hiding in the crypts all this time. Trusting Bran’s vision, they
decide it is now safe to come out of hiding. 
Hodor
 moves a massive stone blocking off the door out of the crypts,
and they indeed find Winterfell in ashes. They find several of 
Theon
’s ironmen dead, along with men bearing the
badge of the 
Dreadfort
.
The direwolves rejoin them, and lead them to Maester 
Luwin
 who lies near death in the godswood, which is still
largely untouched. Jojen says, "There is power in living wood, a power strong as fire." The maester is thankful that
the boys are still alive, although he knew that Theon had killed the miller’s boys from their looks, but had never
revealed his knowledge to Theon. Maester Luwin admits that he is dying, and provides his last advice. He tells 
Osha
not to send the boys off together, they are 
Robb
’s heirs and must be separated. Osha asks him where to bring the
boys, but Luwin is unsure, with the 
ironmen
 to the west, the 
Bastard of Bolton
 to the east, and war everywhere,
"each man against his neighbor, and winter is coming…such folly, such black mad folly…" Maester Luwin tells
Bran to be strong, that he is 
his father
’s son. He then asks a boon of Osha, and the wildling woman sends the others
away. When she returns, it is decided that Bran will go north in search of the crow with Jojen, 
Meera
, Hodor and
Summer, while Osha will take 
Rickon
 and 
Shaggydog
 south, perhaps to 
White Harbor
. As Bran looks upon
Winterfell for perhaps the last time, he thinks to himself, The stone is strong, the roots of the trees go deep, and
under the ground the 
Kings of Winter
 sit their thrones. It is not dead, just broken. much like Bran himself.

Synopsis
Chett
's hatred of 
Jon Snow
 and 
Samwell Tarly
 for usurping his comfortable position as steward to Maester 
Aemon
has boiled over. He and 
Lark
 the Sisterman are conspiring to desert the 
Night's Watch
, along with 
Small Paul
 and
about a dozen other sworn brothers. The traitors plan to kill Lord Commander 
Mormont
 and several other officers to
prevent anyone from actively seeking them out after they desert.
Thoren Smallwood
 and his party are the only of the three rangings to return so far, and they have seen the size of
Mance Rayder
’s army. Thoren wishes to give battle to Mance’s army, mainly because there are so few warriors in it,
it's composed of mostly women and children. Chett and his men plan to kill in the dead of night, and flee to places of
safety, leaving Thoren Smallwood and 
Ottyn Wythers
 as senior rangers. Thoren won’t search for them because he
wants to lead the attack, and Wythers would rather flee to the Wall and could not care less about deserters. That
evening, the Watch gathers before Mormont and his senior men, who announce that they will march in force against
the 
wildling
 army, which is about ten days away. Mormont acknowledges that they might all die and has his men
reaffirm their oaths to the Night's Watch. Meanwhile, Chett worries that some of his deserters may lose their resolve.
Late in the night, Chett awakens to find it snowing. The desertion plans are ruined because the turn cloaks can be
easily tracked in the fresh snow. Chett still seeks to get some satisfaction from the night and creeps over to the
sleeping Samwell Tarly, with the intention of murdering him. He is interrupted as a ranger in the distance sounds his
horn. Sam awakens, and he and Chett hear the horn blow three times. Both men are shocked at the realization of
what three horn blows mean, a signal that has not been used in hundreds and thousands of years. Three horn blows
mean 
Others
. Chett looks down and realizes he has wet himself.

Synopsis
Ser 
Jaime
 is being escorted to 
King's Landing
 by 
Brienne
 and his cousin, Ser 
Cleos Frey
, by boat. He was released
in secrecy from 
Riverrun
 by 
Catelyn
 after swearing never again to take up arms against the 
Starks
 or 
Tullys
, and to
honor his brother 
Tyrion's
 pledge to release 
Sansa
 and 
Arya
. The oath was sworn at sword point and while drunk,
and Jaime considers killing Brienne and getting away. He is still chained hand and foot.
Jaime ponders 
Cersei's
 feelings with him after the 
Bran
 incident and wonders if she sent the assassin to Bran's room,
but dismisses that notion thinking that she would have sent Jaime himself to do the dirty work. Their boat is moving
down the 
Red Fork
 of the 
Trident
, and Jaime has Cleos shave his head so he will be less recognizable should they
get caught. He and Brienne treat each other with contempt. She stops their boat to cut down and bury several tavern
wenches hanging in the trees. Jaime mocks Brienne because a note reveals the women were killed by 
northmen
,
most likely Bolton men, for servicing 
Lannister
 men.
Their trip is interrupted when Brienne spots a river galley bearing down on them. The galley is under the command
of Ser 
Robin Ryger
, sent by Ser 
Edmure Tully
 to return the Kingslayer to Riverrun. Brienne jumps out of the skiff
and climbs a cliff face. Jaime distracts the men on the galley by challenging Robin to single combat while Brienne
dislodges a large boulder which crashes down on the galley, sinking it. When Brienne swims back to the skiff, Jaime
considers smashing her in the face with his oar, but instead pulls her into the boat. Jaime derides Brienne and asks
her if she wants his thanks, but she rebuffs the "Kingslayer" and says she is only motivated by the oath she swore to
Catelyn to return him to King's Landing. Jaime marvels at Brienne's sense of duty.

Synopsis
Ser 
Desmond Grell
 is 
castellan
 of 
Riverrun
 while 
Edmure
 is off at battle and he has confined 
Catelyn
 to 
her father
’s
rooms for releasing 
the Kingslayer
 without the consent of King 
Robb
 or Edmure. She is aware Grell has dispatched
Ser 
Robin Ryger
 to bring back Jaime, and hopes that he fails. Her father's room smells of death and it makes Cat
think of Ned and her two youngest boys. Lord Hoster is having fever dreams and mumbling, "Forgive me...the
blood...oh, please...Tansy..." "Dead." "…you’ll have others…sweet babes, and trueborn…" Catelyn recalls that 
Lysa
has had five miscarriages since her marriage and deduces that Lysa must have miscarried before marrying as well.
She realizes that 
Jon Arryn
 had no heir at the time of her and Lysa's twin betrothals. He was older than their father
and as a soiled bride, "Lysa was the price Jon Arryn had to pay for the swords of 
House Tully
." She does not know
who the father of the original miscarriage might have been. Catelyn writes a letter to Lysa pleading for her to come
to Riverrun before their father passes away saying, "He needs your forgiveness," but she realizes Lord Hoster will be
gone before the raven even makes it to 
The Eyrie
. Catelyn goes to the 
sept
 and lights three candles. One for the
Father Above
 for her own father. One for the 
Crone
 "who let the first raven into the world when she peered through
the door of death" and one for the 
Mother
 for Lysa and all the children they had both lost.
Later, Edmure returns to Riverrun, informing Catelyn that he turned away the 
Lannisters
, but that 
Stannis
 lost the
battle
 for 
King's Landing
 and that 
Highgarden
 and 
Dorne
 have both declared for 
Joffrey
. Edmure scolds Catelyn for
freeing Jaime and tells her 
Cersei
 will never free Catelyn's daughters, but Catelyn claims 
Tyrion
 will be held to the
word he spoke in open court and the Kingslayer gave his word as well. Edmure dismisses the Kingslayer's words as
worthless and informs Catelyn that Tyrion took an axe to the head and is most likely dead. Edmure has sent three
ravens informing 
Lord Bolton
 that Jaime has escaped in the hopes of capturing him at 
Harrenhal
. Catelyn despairs
because if Jaime is believed to have escaped instead of being released as part of a prisoner swap, the Lannisters have
no reason to free Catelyn's daughters.

Jaime
 is a sworn brother of the Kingsguard. Tywin will never let Tyrion have the

however, and warns him that he will hang the next whore Tyrion takes to bed.

his misgivings about Jon to the king, but Mance wishes to speak with Jon alone.
Mance indicates that he has seen Jon twice before, once when he was still a 
black brother
 and Jon just a boy, and
again during King 
Robert
’s visit to 
Winterfell
. Mance had disguised himself as a singer in order to see King Robert
and get the measure of 
Benjen Stark
, who was a bane to the 
wildlings
. Testing Jon, he asks why he deserted the
Night’s Watch, but Jon asks him to tell his story first. The king explains that he had been wounded in a hunt and
treated by an old wildling woman. She mended his cloak with burgundy fabric which was rare for wildlings to have
and hence very valuable to part with. When Mance returned to the Watch, they replaced his cloak with a new black
one emphasizing the importance of the black uniform and not recognizing the symbolism of her gift. Mance came to
resent the restriction to the new black cloak of the Night’s Watch.
Jon, knowing now that Mance was at Winterfell, asks, "And did you see where I was seated Mance? Did you see
where they put the bastard?" The king then accepts Jon as member of the 
free folk

 stop at the 
Inn of the Kneeling Man
 to eat. The innkeep mentions the 
Lightning Lord
, and
we learn that Lord Beric and 
Thoros
 are still together raiding in the 
Riverlands
. The innkeep recommends they
abandon their skiff and ride for 
King's Landing
. Brienne buys the inn's horses for three gold and their skiff, getting
robbed blind according to Jaime. The 
husband
 of the innkeeper recommends they follow a specific path to avoid
outlaws, and they ride off. Jaime is impressed that Brienne takes the opposite path, realizing they might have been
set up.
That night, Jaime reminisces of how he became a 
Kingsguard
. 
His sister
 was brought to court by 
Tywin
, who was
Hand
 at the time. He hoped to wed her to prince 
Viserys
. Jaime was squiring for 
Sumner Crakehall
, and was
knighted by 
Arthur Dayne
 during the battle against the 
Kingswood Brotherhood
. Cersei later informed him that their
father meant to wed him to 
Lysa Arryn
, and she told him that if he took the white cloak, they could be together in
King's Landing. They did it behind their father's back, and Tywin could not object to King 
Aerys
' wishes. Tywin
then resigned as Hand and took Cersei back to 
Casterly Rock
, unknowingly ruining their plan, for Jaime was now
stuck in King's Landing as a sworn brother of the Kingsguard.
Years later, when Aerys made the mistake of admitting Tywin's army, the Mad King called for the former Hand's
head. Alone in the throne room, Aerys had one final plan, but Jaime arrived in his golden armor, the blood of Lord
Rossart
 on his blade, and killed the King. Jaime had hoped to slip out unnoticed, but his father's men entered the
throne room, and they thought Jaime meant to give the throne to his father, but Jaime told them he didn't care who
was proclaimed king. He was waiting on the Iron Throne to see who would come to claim the kingdom, but it was
Eddard Stark
 who found him there. Eddard said nothing but he saw the blood of the king Jaime had sworn to protect
on Jaime's hands. If only his father's men hadn't found him standing over Aerys' body…

Synopsis
Arya is gathering vegetables when she hears voices. She warns 
Gendry
 and 
Hot Pie
. They try to hide but one of their
horses gives them away. They are discovered by three men: 
Tom of Sevenstreams
, 
Lem
 and 
Anguy
. The men say
they are 
Kingsmen
 and ask them to come with them to a nearby 
inn
. Arya hesitates but after Anguy shows how
skilled he is with the bow she realizes that they stand no chance and she agrees.
At the inn Gendry remains in the stable to watch their horses although Tom assures them that they are safe. Arya
and Hot Pie enter the 
inn
 with the three men. The innkeeper sold them horses and gave them directions. Tom and his
friends were waiting for them to get the horses back but they did not see them.
Tom gives Arya a paper acknowledging a future payment of three 
dragons
 after the war for their horses. Arya
protests and wonders how they will be able to reach 
Riverrun
. Suddenly Gendry runs in to warn them that there are
strangers outside.
The people in the inn are not worried but Arya is afraid that it will be Ser 
Gregor Clegane
's men. She slams a
tankard in Lem's face and tries to escape but to no avail. The men outside come in and among them, Arya recognizes
Harwin
. He recognizes her and proclaims her real name to the surprise of all.

Catelyn III
Synopsis
Catelyn
 hears 
Robb
’s return from the west, and recalls that when 
Edmure
 returned, dozens of men left after
trampling Robb’s banner, all of them 
Freys
. She is brought before her son to explain why she released 
Jaime
Lannister
. 
Rickard Karstark
, whose sons 
Eddard
 and 
Torrhen
 were killed by Jaime, is angry at her but Robb is more
gentle and acknowledges that "love is not always wise". Thinking about her daughters whom she had hoped to trade
for Ser Jaime, Catelyn agrees. Lord Karstark, however, is unappeased and leaves the room in a fury.
In privacy, Robb introduces his mother to his new bride. Catelyn immediately realizes that, as Robb was pledged to
marry a Frey, he has insulted the Freys and broken the alliance. But with his "love is not always wise" speech Robb
has made it impossible to blame him, as Catelyn disobeyed him because of her love for her daughters.
Robb tells her how he met his wife. He had taken a wound storming 
the Crag
, and 
Jeyne
 nursed him back to health.
The night he was told his brothers were murdered, Jeyne consoled him and they slept together. Robb married her the
next morning. As the 
Westerings
 were vassals of 
House Lannister
, Jeyne has taken her family with her to escape the
revenge of the Lannisters. Catelyn notices that 
Grey Wind
 is not with her son, because Jeyne is afraid of the wolf,
and the beast growls whenever her uncle, 
Rolph Spicer
, is near. Catelyn does not like that and convinces him to send
Ser Rolph off on some errand, for Grey Wind should always be near him. She considers what it may take to appease
Lord 
Walder Frey
 after this slight. The loss of the Freys is strongly felt by Robb, and there was nothing that could be
done when 
Ryman
 and 
Black Walder
 led their men back to 
the Twins
.
Edmure tells 
his uncle
 about his victory against the Lannisters but the latter interrupts him and both the Blackfish
and Robb berate Edmure for his actions. Edmure was told to not to engage the Lannisters because Robb wanted
them to come West. His plan was to hold them there so that the Lannisters would be unable to defend 
King's
Landing
 against 
Stannis Baratheon
's invasion. Edmure's attack delayed 
Tywin Lannister
 long enough for messengers
to reach him, allowing the Lannister host to turn around, link up with 
Mace Tyrell
's army and arrive at King's
Landing to turn the tide at the 
Battle of the Blackwater
. Edmure ruined their whole plan, and admits that he must
make amends. Robb plans to retake 
the North
, but first he must win back the Freys.

Synopsis
Hot Pie
 has decided to stay with 
Sharna
 as a baker at the 
inn
. The others depart for 
Riverrun
, or so 
Tom
 tells 
Arya
.
Harwin
 tells Arya the tale of how they first rode out in search of 
Gregor Clegane
, and about all the men they lost
when Gregor's men fell on them. Most of the 120 men from the original group are dead, including 
Lothar Mallery
and 
Gladden Wylde
. It was all a trap; Lord 
Tywin
 had planned for 
Eddard
 himself to ride out and deal with Gregor,
but 
Jaime
 didn't know of the plan when he attacked Ned in the streets of 
King's Landing
. As Eddard's leg was
broken, he had to send others out. 
Dondarrion
 and his men learned a sharp lesson when the trap sprung. Dondarrion
should have died, having been run through with a lance, but 
Thoros of Myr
 saved him. After Tywin became 
Hand of
the King
 they became outlaws themselves but they kept fighting in the name of 
King Robert
. They harried the
foraging parties and attacked the baggage trains of Tywin's army, and their brotherhood began to grow as many
flocked to their cause, mostly commoners uprooted by the war.
Later, they meet up with 
Greenbeard
 and learn that Jaime Lannister has escaped from Riverrun. When Arya
discovers that they mean to bring her before Lord Beric rather than take her to Riverrun, she tries to ride off, but
Harwin catches her. Her father's man is now a member of the 
Brotherhood Without Banners
, and answers only to
Beric and Thoros' Lord of Light, the god 
R'hllor
.

Synopsis
Sam
 and the few survivors from

 are running south in the middle of night with a heavy snow falling. They
are ringed by men with torches to keep the 
wights
 away, but Sam is beginning to lag and is near exhaustion. He
eventually falls in the snow, and cannot get back on his feet. He recalls the horror that occurred at the Fist, when the
wights fell on the 
Night's Watch
. 
Mormont
 had commanded him to send ravens with warning, and Sam kept sending
them with updates, but when it came time to send a raven with word that their end was near, Sam had already let the
birds escape. The Watch held the Fist at first, using fire arrows to hold back the wights. But the dead were relentless
and eventually overpowered the Watch, men dying by the score. Mormont had the survivors mount up and form a
wedge, slashing past the wights and down off the Fist into the forest. Now they are running for 
the Wall
, pursued by
the wights and perhaps the 
Others
.
Grenn
 tries to get Sam to his feet, but the fat steward is too tired. Finally 
Small Paul
 arrives and carries Sam, but the
three of them have fallen far behind the survivors with their torches, and the cold sets in. Upon an undead horse, an
Other appears from the swirling snow. The being kills Small Paul with its ice sword, but Sam stabs the Other with
the 
dragonglass
 dagger that Jon gave him. The dagger causes the Other to melt away, body and armor, before Sam
and Grenn's eyes. Grenn retrieves the icy cold 
obsidian
 dagger, and they once again run off to try and catch up with
the other survivors.

Synopsis
The 
small council
 meets to discuss the progress of the war, and 
Tyrion
 learns that 
Lancel
 is still near death. 
Randyll
Tarly
 
defeated
 the northmen attacking 
Duskendale
, with 
Helman Tallhart
 reported dead, and 
Robett Glover
 fleeing
west and being chased by 
Gregor Clegane
. Tywin informs them that 
Daven Lannister
 is rounding up a new army
and will join with men from the 
Golden Tooth
, and then march on 
Riverrun
 when 
Robb Stark
 returns north. They all
agree that Robb will march for 
Moat Cailin
, for he is a king without a kingdom.
Kevan
 reveals that 
Balon Greyjoy
 has sent letters with terms of alliance. Greyjoy wants the 
North
, but Tywin says
they will not treat with Balon while other options may present themselves. 
Littlefinger
 agrees to go to the 
Eyrie
 to
marry 
Lysa Arryn
, and once he is consort, deliver 
the Vale
 of Arryn into Tywin's hands. Since Littlefinger will be
leaving within a day, Tyrion is named 
master of coins
. 
Pycelle
 informs them that 300 
Dornishmen
 ride for 
King's
Landing
 in response to Tyrion's negotiations, despite the hatred between 
Dorne
 and 
Highgarden
 that has gone on for
hundreds of years.
Mace Tyrell
 does not like the idea of Dornishmen riding across 
the Reach
. Tyrion considers how the Lord of
Highgarden talked like a general although he had never won a decisive battle. His victory over 
Robert Baratheon
 at
Ashford
 was won by Randyll Tarly and the 
siege of Storm's End
 lasted for a year without result until 
Eddard Stark
relieved the castle.
Garlan Tyrell
 has been named Lord of 
Brightwater Keep
 since 
Alester Florent
 is a traitor. 
Varys
 brings word of a
three-headed dragon being born in 
Qarth
, and that the 
Night's Watch
 is begging for help against a 
wildling
 army.
Lord Tywin
 does not want to hear about rumors of dragons, and is disinterested in news of wildlings, claiming that
if 
the Wall
 is overrun, the 
Starks
 and 
Greyjoys
 will have a new enemy to deal with, even speculating they may be
able to make a deal with 
Mance Rayder
, overriding the attempts of Varys and Tyrion to have gold cloaks who
deserted during the 
Battle of the Blackwater
 forced to take the black. He adjourns the meeting, asking Tyrion, 
Cersei
and Kevan to stay. Tyrion warns them not to trust Littlefinger with this quest to the Vale, but Tywin is resolute,
believing it better to have Baelish ruling the Vale as opposed to the likes of 
Yohn Royce
 or 
Lyn Corbray
 and adds
that Littlefinger has proven his loyalty, telling Tyrion that just the other day Baelish informed them of a plot by the
Tyrells to bring 
Sansa
 to Highgarden and marry her to 
Willas
. The Hand is aware that should Mace Tyrell ask leave
to bring Sansa to Highgarden, they must consent or else offend the Tyrells. Tywin wishes to circumvent this
problem by offering Cersei's hand in marriage to Willas. Cersei adamantly refuses but her father has the final say,
and Cersei storms out of the room in a fury. Tywin then tells Tyrion that he will wed Sansa Stark, further solidifying
the Lannisters's position, because should 
Robb
 die and Sansa and Tyrion have a son, the child will become Lord of
Winterfell
.
Tyrion protests, arguing that a marriage to Sansa is worthless while the Greyjoys hold the north and questions why
he isn't being forced into a marriage with Balon's 
daughter
, but Tywin counters that the 
ironborn
 won't rule the
north, they will just plunder it, uniting the northmen against them, which the Lannisters can use to retake the north
when Tyrion brings Ned Stark's grandson home to claim his birthright. Tyrion argues again, protesting that Sansa is
still a child, but Tywin retorts with Cersei's testimony the girl has flowered. Tyrion suggests sending the girl back to
her mother
 as a gesture of goodwill that might make Robb Stark bend the knee, but Tywin coldly retorts that if they

do that, Sansa will be married off to one of the northern or Riverlords to shore up her brother's alliances. Tywin adds
that this marriage is a reward for Tyrion's previous service and threatens that if Tyrion won't go through with it, they
will marry Sansa off to Lancel or another of his cousins and find Tyrion another bride; the threat of being married to
Lollys Stokeworth
, as well as the prospect of being made Lord of Winterfell if he is to be denied 
Casterly Rock
 is
enough to cow Tyrion.
As a last attempt at protest, Tyrion argues that any claim Sansa might have to Winterfell will be made irrelevant
when her brother gets a child from whichever Frey girl he marries, and learns to his surprise that Robb Stark has
broken his pledge with the 
Freys
 and married 
Jeyne Westerling
. Ser Kevan reveals that 
Lord Westerling
's 
wife
 is a
Spicer, a house of extremely low birth having descended from traders. Tyrion is confused by the lack of fury in his
father's eyes at this betrayal by the Westerlings, a house sworn to Casterly Rock. Lord Tywin states, "Jeyne
Westerling is her mother's daughter, and Robb Stark is 
his father
's son."

The 
Greatjon
 brings Lord 
Rickard Karstark
 and four of his men to Robb as prisoners.
Rickard, who was overcome with grief and anger, sought vengeance for the loss of his two sons. After 
Catelyn
released Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 from captivity, he and his men murdered Willem Lannister and Tion Frey in their cells
at 
Riverrun
, killing two guards in the process. Robb orders Rickard's accomplices to be hanged and sentences
Rickard to death, knowing that he must perform the execution himself, as both the 
Starks
 and 
Karstarks
 are
descended from the 
First Men

The rest of the Karstark men had already departed Riverrun to seek out and kill Jaime Lannister, also offering gold
and the hand of 
Rickard's daughter
 in marriage to anyone who could turn the Kingslayer over to them. 
Edmure
 urges
Robb to hold Lord Karstark hostage and not to let word get out to the 
Freys

Lannisters

squires. But Robb feels he has been betrayed by the murder and has no choice but to kill the man whose two sons
died defending his life. Robb carries out the sentence in the

advice in comforting Robb, and the young woman promises that she will soon bear Robb's son if the gods answer

Daenerys III
Synopsis
Daenerys
 and one of the master slavers in 
Astapor
 are discussing the purchase of 
Unsullied
 through a 
translator
.
Dany is pretending not to know 
High Valyrian
 speech, but she understands everything the slaver is saying to the
translator. 
Kraznys
 demonstrates the loyalty of the Unsullied, how the eunuchs follow every command given them
and feel hardly any pain. Both Daenerys and 
Arstan
 are horrified by the conditions the Unsullied live under, and the
brutality of their training. The slaver indicates he has 8,000 Unsullied currently for sale. Daenerys informs him she
will spend the night considering the offer.
Arstan is against the use of slaves, when 
sellswords
 can be bought in the 
Free Cities
; he insists that if Daenerys
lands in 
Westeros
 at the head of a slave army, many of the realm's people will oppose her for no more reason than
the abbhorence of slavery. Daenerys is, however, too proud to go back to 
Pentos
 as a beggar, not after seeing what it
did to her 
brother
, how bitter and angry constantly begging for help left him.
Lonely since 
her husband's
 death and confused over Ser 
Jorah Mormont
's advances on her, Daenerys takes 
Irri
 as a
lover one night, the 
Dothraki
 handmaiden more than willing to sexually pleasure her 
Khaleesi
, but Daenerys finds
no release, only guilt over treating her handmaid as a bedslave.
The next morning, when Ser Jorah comes to speak with her, Daenerys snaps at him; she despises Astapor and has
only contempt for the Unsullied, but she still recognizes that they are too useful to pass up. Ser Jorah also gives
Daenerys more food for thought on hiring the Unsullied, pointing out that they don't rape nor put to the sword the
population of cities they've conquered unless specifically ordered to, minimizing the bloodshed that will inevitably
occur when Daenerys starts the war to reclaim her throne. He also points out their usefulness in answering Daenerys'
query as to why Astapor has never been sacked, since any enemy attacking Astapor would face the city's entire
garrison of Unsullied, there are few neighboring cities and nations that pose a threat, and the combination of the
Unsullied's reputation and heavy bribes offered by Astapor's rulers are enough to dissuade passing Dothraki
Khalasars
 from attacking the city.
Daenerys is tempted, knowing that Viserys would purchase as many Unsullied as he could, but she questions if she
can be anything like 
Rhaegar
, to whom Arstan and Jorah keep comparing her, if the loyalty of her men is only based
on being bought and paid for. Ser Jorah points out that Rhaegar's honor and the loyalty he inspired in his men didn't
save him from dying at 
the Trident
.

Synopsis
Traveling north to

, 
Bran
 and his companions meet a 
Liddle
 in the hills. The man indicates that the 
Bastard
of Bolton
 is offering gold for wolfskins and for word on the walking dead. Later, 
Meera
 tells a story of a hero who
might have been a 
crannogman
 (judging from other characters in the story, presumably 
Howland Reed
), during the
year of the false spring
. This crannogman had left 
Greywater Watch
 and visited the 
Green Men
 on the 
Isle of Faces
.
Returning home, he stopped at 
Harrenhal
 for the 
great tourney
. Three squires accosted him and mocked him for his
short stature, knocking him to the ground until he was rescued by a 
she-wolf
. The story names no names, but from
their references, we know who they are.
The story tells of 
Jaime Lannister
 being named to the 
Kingsguard
, despite 
his father
's absence (Tywin had recently
resigned as 
Hand
). The 
Wild Wolf
 had asked 
Ashara Dayne
, one of princess 
Elia
's ladies-in-waiting, to dance with
his 
shy brother
. 
The pup
 offered the crannogman some armor so that he could take his vengeance on the squires
during the tourney, but the little man turned him down. The crannogmen prayed to the 
old gods
, and the next day at
the tourney, a 
mystery knight
 called the 
Knight of the Laughing Tree
 defeated the knights whose squires had
wronged the crannogman. Instead of collecting a ransom from the three defeated knights, the mystery knight asked
them to teach their squires honor. The Knight of the Laughing Tree disappeared before he could be unmasked,
despite the fury of King 
Aerys II
. The tourney was won by prince 
Rhaegar
, but Meera ends the story by saying that
what happened next is a sadder tale that deserves its own telling. Bran has never heard this story before, and both
Reeds are surprised that Lord Eddard never related it to him.

 is too weak, and
should she draw more life-energy from him he would die. Melisandre tells Davos that there are only two gods,
R'hllor
 and the 
Great Other
, whose name cannot be spoken. They are opposites, white and black, good and evil, fire
and ice. The Other is the god of Darkness, the Soul of Ice and his war with R’hllor is everywhere and everlasting.
Melisandre claims that the 
Other’s
 servants often hide in plain view, but the priests of R’hllor can see through
falsehoods. She explains that she saw in the flames that Davos wanted to murder her. Davos admits to this, blaming
her for the death of his sons who died in the 
Battle of the Blackwater
. Melisandre speaks of a prophesy, which
portends that 
Azor Ahai
 will be born again in the light of R’hllor, and she is convinced that Stannis is the
embodiment of this prophecy: "When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again
amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone." Melisandre departs, telling him that he (Davos) has served
R’hllor once and will do so again.
Later, 
Axell Florent
 brings his brother 
Alester
, Stannis’ 
Hand
, and tosses him into the cell with Davos. Lord Florent
is a defeated man, and he tells Davos that his nephew 
Imry
 died with the fleet, and that most of Stannis’ bannermen
were captured at the battle and bent the knee to 
Joffrey
. He is now condemned as a traitor for writing a letter he
planned to send to Lord 
Tywin
, offering peace and suggesting that Stannis would swear fealty to Joffrey but would
remain Lord of Dragonstone and 
Storm's End
, and that the Florents would get 
Brightwater Keep
 back. In addition,
he offered 
Shireen
’s hand in marriage to 
Tommen
. Alester rants about Melisandre’s talk of a stone dragon,
"madness, sheer madness. Did we learn nothing from 
Aerion Brightfire
, from the nine mages, from the alchemists?
Did we learn nothing from 
Summerhall
? No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons." Davos knows
Stannis well and tells Florent that Stannis would rather die a king than bend his knee, and that he would never
consent to wed his daughter to Tommen, a child born of incest.

attack the slavers. With the help of the Unsullied who obey her as she is now their owner she has the slavers killed.
The other slaves join her and soon

soul. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land."
When Dondarrion appears, Arya is appalled by his appearance. Once handsome, the man is now stick thin, missing
an eye, with part of his skull crushed in, a noose scar around his neck, and a terrible wound through his chest.
Dondarrion asks for charges to be made against Sandor, but the Hound spits at the accusations, laying them at the
feet of his brother and others. But Arya accuses him of killing

The fight ends with Clegane’s shield destroyed and his left arm in flames, but the Hound cuts Dondarrion from
shoulder to breastbone. Sandor is screaming in pain and fear from the hideous burn to his arm. When Arya confronts

Thoros, to tell Sandor he has gone to hell.

Synopsis
Axell Florent
 brings 
Davos
 before King 
Stannis
, taking the torch with him to leave his brother 
Alester
 alone in the
darkness. Axell tells Davos in private that he has seen Stannis’ victory in the flames, and if Davos does not help him
become 
Hand
, he will see the Onion Knight killed. Stannis proclaims that Alester will die for treason, and has Axell
tell Davos of his plan to invade 
Claw Isle
. Davos calls the plan a folly, and Stannis dismisses the enraged Axell.
Stannis mentions that 
Barristan Selmy
 once told him that "the rot in 
King Aerys
' reign began with 
Varys
", and that
Robert
 should have killed the eunuch, and sent 
Jaime
 to 
the Wall
 as Lord 
Eddard
 had suggested, but Robert listened
to 
Jon Arryn
 instead.
Stannis then raises Davos to Lord of the 
Rainwood
, Admiral of the 
Narrow Sea
, and his new Hand of the King.
When Stannis mentions battle, Davos mistakes him to mean the continuance of the war, but 
Melisandre
 has entered
the room and calls it "the 
great battle
… Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends". Stannis has also seen a
vision in the flames, of men in black with torches on a high hill in the forest during snow, while all around them
shapes were moving. Melisandre proclaims that Westeros must unite under King Stannis in order to defeat the one
whose name must not be spoken. The King takes three leeches fat with the blood of 
Edric Storm
 and tosses them
one at a time into a brazier, naming each of the false kings: 
Joffrey

Balon Greyjoy

Robb

that this is not the best way, for it both will and will not work. The better way is to sacrifice Edric Storm to the
flames, for there is power in a king's blood: Melisandre believes that his death will wake the stone dragon, as
prophesized, and the sacrifice of one life to save thousands of others is warranted, but Stannis will not hear of it.

Synopsis
Jaime
 and 
Brienne
 are in the bathhouse in 
Harrenhal
, washing themselves before meeting 
Roose Bolton
. Jaime feels
dizzy in the hot bath, and begins to tell Brienne his story despite his own misgivings about revealing the tale. Jaime
says, "
Aerys
 would have bathed in wildfire if he’d dared. The 
Targaryens
 were all mad for fire." After the 
Battle of
the Bells
, Aerys realized that 
Robert Baratheon
 was no mere outlaw, and that the Targaryens faced their greatest
threat since the 
Blackfyre Pretenders
. He began to disperse his 
Kingsguard
 to take command of the army, recalled
Rhaegar
 from the south, and sent letters to 
Casterly Rock
. But when 
Tywin Lannister
 never responded, Aerys
commanded his pyromancers 
Rossart
, 
Garigus
 and 
Belis
 “to place caches of 
wildfire
 throughout 
King's Landing
.”
Lord 
Chelsted
, the current 
Hand
, found out what was going on and tried to stop Aerys from continuing along his
mad course, but Aerys had him killed and named the pyromancer Rossart, the man who had burned 
Rickard Stark
alive, his Hand.
All this time, Jaime remained in the throne room guarding the king and his secrets. After the 
Trident
, Aerys sent 
his
wife
 and Prince 
Viserys
 to 
Dragonstone
, but kept 
Elia
 and her children in the 
Red Keep
 because he thought that
Prince 
Lewyn Martell
 had betrayed Rhaegar during the battle, and thus needed Elia and the children as hostages to
ensure 
Dorne
's loyalty. With the wildfire in place, Aerys told Rossart, "The traitors want my city, but I’ll give them
naught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat." Aerys may have thought that the great
fire would kill everyone, but transform him into a dragon, much as 
Aerion Brightflame
 had thought. When the
Lannisters
 appeared before King's Landing 
Varys
 advised to keep the gates closed. But on the advice of 
Pycelle
,
Aerys let in the Lannisters, who proceeded to 
sack King's Landing
.
Jaime felt he had to act after the Mad King commanded him to bring him his father’s head. He killed Rossart, then
returned to the Throne room and killed King Aerys. Days later he hunted down and killed the remaining two of
Aerys’ pyromancers, Garigus and Belis, so that their secret would die with them. When Brienne asks why no one
else knows this tale, Jaime tells her that the 
Kingsguard
 are sworn to protect the king’s secrets, and that 
Eddard
would never have believed his tale. Jaime then nearly passes out from the heat, and Brienne calls out for 
Qyburn
.
They are brought before Roose Bolton, who tells them he chose to wed 
Walda Frey
 because Lord 
Walder Frey
offered him his bride’s weight in silver. When Brienne inquires after 
Arya
, Bolton mysteriously states that she was
lost for a time, but she has been found and is to be returned safely to the north. Bolton tells them he awarded
Harrenhal to 
Vargo Hoat
 because the goat was a stranger to the 
Seven Kingdoms
 and did not know ‘the prize was
poisoned’. He means the curse of Lord Tywin, for Hoat was not aware of what Tywin does to traitors such as the
Tarbecks
 and the 
Reynes
. Bolton explains that he has a small problem, because the goat wishes to return Jaime to
Rickard Karstark
 to claim the Lord’s reward of 
his daughter
’s hand in marriage. Vargo had Jaime’s hand chopped
off to send as a grisly token to Lord Tywin, feeling he would be well safe in 
Karhold
. What he doesn’t know is that
Robb
 has beheaded Lord Karstark, and the goat is now doomed. But since Vargo is in Bolton’s employ, Tywin
might feel that Bolton was responsible for the maiming as well. Jaime agrees to carry word to his father absolving
Bolton of all blame. But as for Brienne, Bolton tells her, "It would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo
of both his prizes."

Synopsis
Tyrion
 has been sent to greet the three hundred 
Dornishmen
 with a small retinue. However, he is shocked when he
finds that the Dornishmen are being led by Prince 
Oberyn Martell
 and not his brother, Prince 
Doran
. The Red Viper
of Dorne has an infamous reputation for using poisoned weapons in battle. The man fought in the 
Free Cities
 and
even formed his own 
sellsword
 company, he studied at the 
Citadel
 for a time, and most importantly, he crippled
Willas Tyrell
 in a tourney. Though this was years ago, it has never been forgotten by the 
Tyrells
, who will not be
happy that this man is attending the marriage of one of them.
The Red Viper tells Tyrion the story of how he and 
Elia
 traveled to 
Casterly Rock
 when Tyrion was an infant. It was
just after the death of 
Joanna Lannister
. 
Tywin Lannister
 was in mourning and ignored the Martells. Oberyn and Elia
were disappointed to find out that Tyrion was only a dwarf, after the stories they had heard about him being Tywin’s
monster son. The Red Viper then gets down to the point, asking Tyrion, "when will justice be served?" He warns
Tyrion that he does not mean to stop after killing 
Gregor Clegane
: "Before he dies, the Enormity that Rides will tell
me whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that." But Tyrion has a more subtle warning: The
Lannisters
 have tens of thousands of Tyrell men present as allies. And the Tyrells hate the Dornish, and especially
Prince Oberyn for what he did to Willas.

Hound

complain that the Hound will follow and murder them in their sleep, Beric states, "Sandor Clegane would kill us all
gladly, but not in our sleep."

Synopsis
Bran
 and the others reach a small, deserted village on a lake. There is a 
holdfast tower
 on an island in the middle of
the lake, and Bran tells them that Good Queen 
Alysanne
 once stayed there. 
Brandon's Gift
 is a strip of land south of
the Wall to a distance of 25 leagues which was once given to the 
Night's Watch
 to support them. The 
New Gift
,
given to the Watch by Queen Alysanne and her husband King 
Jaehaerys I
, doubled that distance. Bran tells them
there is a secret walkway just beneath the lake’s surface that will allow them to reach the tower.
They stay in the tower that night during a terrible thunderstorm, and Bran tells them that all the gates through the
Wall were sealed when each of the castles had to be abandoned, leaving only three gates open at each of the manned
castles. When 
Hodor
 starts to scream in fear of the thunder, Bran reaches out to him the way he does to 
Summer
,
and calms the big man. 
Jojen
 spots men on the shore in the village, and Bran enters Summer to investigate.

Synopsis
Jon
 is with 
the Magnar
’s men nearing 
a village
 alongside a lake. He realizes that he must somehow escape and reach
Castle Black
 before the raiders do, in order to warn them. The 
Thenns
 captured an old man camped in one of the
ruined houses, and Styr commands Jon to kill the man. Jon balks, but 
Ygritte
 slits the man’s throat with her dagger.
As Styr begins to command his men in the Old Tongue, a crash of thunder sounds, and suddenly a 
direwolf
 is
attacking the Thenns. Jon mistakes the wolf for 
Ghost
 or 
Grey Wind
 for a moment, wondering if 
Robb
 returned to
the North, but he never realizes that it is 
Summer
. The direwolf slaughters several 
wildlings
, and in the confusion,
Jon mounts the old man’s horse and begins to flee. He is hit with an arrow in the calf, believing the shot was fired by
Ygritte. Jon gets away, forcing the horse to gallop for hours without rest, heading for Castle Black.

Synopsis
Daenerys
 and her army of 
Unsullied
 reach 
Yunkai
, to find the city guarded by a huge force including two 
sellsword
companies. She knows that open battle will cost her many lives, even though her commanders feel she will win
easily. Daenerys tells her men to invite the two sellsword Captains, as well as the Yunkish leader. The first to arrive
are the three Captains of the 
Stormcrows
, who spurn her offer to join her, although she notices 
Daario Naharis
 smile
at her as they leave. The Captain of the 
Second Sons
 also laughs at her offer, but does accept a wagonload of wine to
bring to his men. The master slaver brings Daenerys chests full of gold hoping she will leave Yunkai alone, but she
sends him off with his gold and a warning that she will attack in three days time.
After he leaves, Daenerys tells her commanders that they will attack that night, since none of Yunkai’s defenders
will be expecting it. Soon after, Daario returns with the heads of the other two Stormcrow Captains, and swears the
service of his company. 
Jorah
 warns her not to trust the 
Tyroshi
, yet she commands the battle to commence as
planned. During the fight, she asks 
Arstan
 to tell her more of her brother 
Rhaegar
. Whitebeard explains that the
Prince was always melancholy, and a sense of doom hung over him. "He was born in grief, and that shadow hung
over him all his days." Daenerys knows that it was the shadow of 
Summerhall
 that Arstan was referring to. Word
arrives that her army won the battle easily during the night, with the help of the Stormcrows, and all the Second
Sons too drunk to fight. Daenerys commands her men to spare any who threw down their swords, and promised to
free any slaves. Once again, Daenerys’ army swells to even greater size. Daenerys rides on her white mare past all
the newly freed people who call out to her as "Mother!"

 and the

 visit the

. Arya escapes the outlaws but is
captured by the 
Hound
.
Synopsis
Gendry
 mentions that Master 
Mott
 considered 
Thoros
 a false priest, and Thoros agrees. He was sent to the 
Seven
Kingdoms
 to bring word of 
R'hllor
, but he spent his time eating and whoring. King 
Robert
 was fond of him, and
many enjoyed the sight of his flaming sword in melees. Lord 
Beric
 silences Thoros by saying, "Fire consumes. It
consumes, and when it is done there is nothing left. Nothing." The outlaws reach 
High Heart
 again, and the ancient
dwarf woman calls Beric the Lord of Corpses, for the stink of the grave is fresh on him. The 
ghost of High Heart
tells them her dreams: the 
kraken king
 is dead, and Lord 
Hoster
 too; the 
goat
 sits alone in the 
hall of kings
 in a fever
"as the 
great dog
 
descends on him
"; she dreamt of drums and pipes and screams 
making a great clangor
; and "of 
a
maid
 at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again,
slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow." Suddenly, she spots 
Arya
, and calls her "blood child" and "dark
heart", bidding her to leave. When Beric explains to the old dwarf woman that Arya is being brought to 
Riverrun
,
she tells them to seek 
her mother
 at the 
Twins
, for there is to be a wedding. She then demands a song as payment for
her dreams, the same song she always requests from 
Tom
; 
Jenny of Oldstones
.
Later, Arya speaks with 
Edric Dayne
, who is called Ned like 
her father
. Edric tells her that he saw her father during
the Hand's tourney
 while he squired for Lord Beric. He reveals that Beric was promised to 
his aunt
, “but that was
before he died”, Arya thinks to herself. Ned tells her of 
Wylla
, his 
wet nurse
, who he says is the mother of 
Jon
Snow
. She has been in the service of the 
Daynes
 for years, and Ned is surprised that Arya’s father never spoke of
her nor of 
Ashara
, Ned’s aunt. He tells Arya that her father and Ashara fell in love during the 
tourney at Harrenhal
,
and that she killed herself after the war because her heart was broken. Arya does not believe the young Lord of
Starfall
, believing her father only loved her mother. She asks 
Harwin
 about it, and he confirms that Eddard and
Ashara may have fallen in love at Harrenhal, but at that time his brother 
Brandon
 was betrothed to Catelyn. He
claims that Ashara killed herself over grief for 
her brother
, and tells Arya "Let it lie, my lady. They’re dead, all of
them."
When the outlaws come upon a ruined village, Arya thinks the 
Lannisters
 destroyed it, but she is told that the village
was destroyed years before by Hoster Tully, because Lord 
Goodbrook
, the lord of the village, had fought for the
Targaryens
 during 
Robert's Rebellion
. Later, Thoros sees in his flames that Riverrun will soon come under attack by
the Lannisters again, and he believes the ghost’s dream that Catelyn and Robb are at the Twins. That night, Arya
sneaks off while everyone else is asleep, feeling that the outlaws cannot be her pack if they want to ransom her off to
her 
brother
, mother, or uncle 
Brynden
. However, she is captured by 
the Hound
 while racing through the woods.

 he told 
Jaime
 to give his warm
regards to 
his father
. Jaime responds, 
"So long as you give mine to 
Robb Stark
."
Jaime is now traveling for 
King's Landing
 under the protection of Steelshanks 
Walton
 and a host of 
Dreadfort
 men.
Qyburn
 tells him that Lord 
Selwyn
 has promised Vargo Hoat 300 gold dragons for the safe return of 
his daughter
,
but the goat wants more as he still believes there are sapphires in 
Evenfall Hall
.
One night, Jaime has a bizarre fever dream that he and Brienne are trapped in the dank caverns beneath 
Casterly
Rock
. He sees the shades of the other knights of the 
Kingsguard
 as well as Prince 
Rhaegar
, come to judge him for
killing 
Aerys
. After the fire of his sword goes out, Brienne’s continues to burn, defending him from the shades.
When Jaime awakens, he commands Walton to return to Harrenhal saying that he "forgot something". Back at
Harrenhal, the goat’s men open the gates, and Jaime finds that Brienne has been tossed into the bear pit with only a
tourney sword.
Vargo Hoat, with a bandage around his face from where Brienne bit off his ear, will not pull the woman up. Jaime
jumps into the pit to save Brienne, and holds off the bear long enough for Walton’s men to fill it with quarrels. The
Mummers
 are unable to stop them because Steelshanks' escort of 200 men outnumbers them two to one.
Vargo asks Jaime to tell his father that he had been merciful, and the Kingslayer promises that the goat will receive
his ransom. When Brienne asks him why he came back, Jaime responds that he had dreamed of her.

Synopsis
Traveling in the rain to 
the Twins
, 
Catelyn
 recalls 
Robb
 sending Ser 
Rolph Spicer
 to deliver 
Martyn Lannister
 to the
Golden Tooth
 in an exchange of captives. We also learn that 
Robett Glover
 has been put on a ship at 
Duskendale
 as
part of the agreement. Robb left 
his wife
 at 
Riverrun
, and only Ser 
Raynald Westerling
 travels with them. Robb has
brought 3,500 men with him, those who have been with him since the 
Battle of the Whispering Wood
, and who will
follow him to 
Moat Cailin
 after the wedding. While passing through 
the site of the battle
, Catelyn thinks of 
Theon
Greyjoy
 boasting he had almost crossed swords with Ser 
Jaime
 and how much ill would have been undone if Theon
had died in place of 
Lord Karstark
’s sons.
When they reach 
Oldstones
, Cat recalls that the ruins were once a great castle of the 
River Kings
 during the 
Mudd
Dynasty
. The Mudds were 
First Men
, but during the time of King 
Tristifer IV
, the kingdoms of the First Men were
falling before the onslaught of the 
Andals
. Tristifer IV died when seven Andal kings joined forces against him.
Robb tells his mother that he plans to legitimize his brother 
Jon
 and name him heir should he and Jeyne not have a
child. Catelyn is stunned by this proclamation, and pleads with him not to make the mistake the 
Targaryens
 made
when King 
Aegon IV Targaryen
 legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed. The 
Blackfyre Pretenders
 plagued the
Targaryens for five generations until Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 slew 
Maelys Blackfyre
 on the 
Stepstones
. They both fear
that 
Sansa
 will give 
the Imp
 a son and thus control of 
Winterfell
 and agree that must be prevented. She pleads that
Robb consider naming his sister 
Arya
 as heir, but Robb insists that no one has seen Arya since 
his father's
 death and
that his sister is likely also dead. Catelyn tells Robb that she cannot support his choice of Jon but Robb reminds her
that he doesn't have to ask for her support, stating his reason as, "I'm the King."
Jason Mallister
 soon joins Robb’s force at 
Hag's Mire
, bringing with him the captain of the 
Myraham
. The man tells
them that 
Balon Greyjoy
 fell to his death when a wind blew him off one of the bridges between the towers of 
Pyke
,
and no sooner was he dead than 
Euron Crow’s Eye
 returned and claimed the 
Seastone Chair
, naming himself King
of the Iron Islands and the North. Knowing 
Victarion
 and 
Asha
 will not stand still for this, Robb commands 
Maege
Mormont
 and 
Galbart Glover
 to take men by longship and sail through the marshes of 
the Neck
 to seek out 
Howland
Reed
. Robb plans to march on Moat Cailin with 12,000 men once he joins with 
Roose Bolton
. The 
crannogmen
 will
guide a small force under Robb’s command across the swamps in order to reach Moat Cailin from the north. When
Galbart warns him what should happen if the crannogmen were to fail him, Robb replies, "They will not fail. My
father knew the worth of Howland Reed." Robb then announces that Catelyn will be taken to 
Seagard
 under the
protection of Lord Jason after the wedding. He then calls his bannermen to fix their seals as witnesses to the decree
naming his heir.

moment, he admits to himself that it is not the face he and his brothers saw when they started out on the ranging.
Nor does he remember its red eyes weeping blood (sap). Sam prays earnestly to the 
old gods
 to protect them. He and
Gilly camp in one of the 
wildling
 huts for the night, but Sam is woken by shapes moving within. The corpse of
Small 
Paul
 comes after Sam, and he tries to stab it with the 
obsidian
 dagger, but it shatters upon contact with Paul’s
chainmail. Despairing, Sam thrusts a burning stick from the campfire in the wight’s mouth, setting it on fire. Outside
the hut, the wights begin to surround Gilly and her infant son after killing their horse. Thinking all is lost, a raven
lands on Sam’s shoulder, and suddenly thousands of ravens fly from the branches of the 
weirwood
 tree to tear the
wights to pieces. The raven perching on Sam's shoulder speaks, telling him to go, and he and Gilly begin to run
south, but without their horse they fear they'll be overtaken by wights. Suddenly a voice calls out, "Brother! Here."
From the falling snow appears 
a man
 dressed all in black astride a great elk. When Sam reaches up for the man’s
bare hand, Sam notices his hand is black and cold as ice.

expression that the "wolf bitch" hates the "pretty bird"--Arya and her sister don't get along. Sandor admits that
maybe he is a monster for killing so many but also tells her that he saved

The Hound informs her that he is taking her to

Synopsis
Robb's
 host approaches 
The Twins
. Robb rides at the head with 
Catelyn
, 
Edmure
 beside him and Ser 
Raynald
bearing his banner. Catelyn cautions Robb again about offending Lord 
Frey
, and advises him to ask for food and
wine as soon as they arrive to secure the 
guest rights
. They are met by a contingent headed by Ser 
Ryman Frey
, Lord
Frey's grandson, and three of Ryman's sons: 
Edwyn
, 
Black Walder
, and 
Petyr
. When they come near, 
Grey Wind
begins to growl and leaps forward, causing Petyr's horse to throw him. Ser Ryman is angered that Queen 
Jeyne
 is
not among them and Catelyn offers her apologies, but Black Walder says that Lord Walder will be displeased. The
Freys tell them they have rooms prepared for Robb, Catelyn, and Edmure, and their bannermen at the 
Water Tower
but the army is to cross the bridge to the far end and join Lord Frey’s and Lord 
Bolton
’s men beneath pavilions
erected for the wedding.
When they reach the gatehouse, Grey Wind refuses to continue and howls. 
Lame Lothar
 comes up, saying he must
fear the water and offering to give him over to the master of hounds but Robb has Ser Raynald stay with him
instead. Robb enters the great hall, where Lord Walder and his eighth wife 
Joyeuse
 await. Lord Walder is relentless
in his veiled insults against Robb, making it clear that the King betrayed him by breaking his solemn oath. Robb
apologizes, and then 
Roslin
 is brought out. She is by far the most beautiful of Walder’s get. After Edmure meets his
soon-to-be-bride, Catelyn asks the Lord of the Crossing for some food and he says "bread and salt . . . of course" and
the old man welcomes them as guests to his table.
When Lord Bolton joins them, Robb finds out more of what happened at 
Winterfell
, and his bannerman tells him
that 
Ramsay
 rescued many of the women and has been fighting the ironmen. Lord Bolton again states that his
bastard son’s blood is tainted, but maybe his deeds will atone for the crimes he committed. He tells them that
Ramsay is holding 
Theon
 hostage, and he shows them a piece of Greyjoy’s skin, his son having been flaying the
captive Greyjoy. Bolton explains that as 
Balon Greyjoy
's sole surviving son, Theon's uncles (
Victarion
, 
Euron
, and
Aeron
) will want him dead as his claim to the 
Seastone Chair
 is greater than theirs, and that they can demand
concessions from the ironborn as the price of Theon's execution; Robb reluctantly agrees for Theon to remain
imprisoned at the 
Dreadfort
. Bolton lost men crossing the 
Trident
 when 
Gregor Clegane
’s army attacked (see 
Battle
of the Ruby Ford
). Bolton has brought mostly his own and 
Karstark
 men, leaving all the others to guard the Trident.

Synopsis
Catelyn
 listens to the continuous pounding noise of the drums the musicians in the hall are playing. She is seated
between 
Ryman Frey
 and 
Roose Bolton
 during the wedding feast. She remarks to herself how joyless the wedding
is, and watches as 
Robb
 dances with several of the Frey maids and 
Edmure
 dotes on his soon to be wife, 
Roslin
.
Catelyn becomes more wary when she learns that 
Olyvar
, 
Perwyn
, and 
Alesander Frey
 are all not in attendance at
the wedding. She notices 
Merrett Frey
 trying to drink the 
Greatjon
 under the table, and finally Lord 
Walder Frey
calls for the bedding. Robb does not participate as the Greatjon carries a weeping Roslin to the bed chamber.
Suddenly, things grow more ominous in the hall as 
Dacey Mormont
 goes up to 
Edwyn Frey
 and asks him if he
wants to dance, but he pushes her away violently. The musicians begin to play a new song, which Catelyn
recognises to her horror as "
The Rains of Castamere
" and sees Edwyn leaving. She takes off after him, and when she
grabs his arm, she feels the rings of chain mail beneath. Suddenly, it all makes sense to her; the Freys missing from
the wedding and Roslin crying.
The musicians turn out to be crossbowmen, and the wedding becomes a slaughter. Catelyn watches in horror as a
crossbow bolt pierces Robb's shoulder and another his leg, and he topples over. 
Smalljon
 throws a table over him to
save him from three more bolts. 
Robin Flint
 is surrounded by Freys, their daggers rising and falling. Ser 
Wendel
Manderly
 is felled by a quarrel through the mouth. Smalljon bludgeons Ser 
Raymund Frey
 across the face with a leg
of mutton, but when he reaches for his swordbelt, a crossbow bolt drives him to his knees. 
Lucas Blackwood
 is cut
down by Ser 
Hosteen Frey
. One of the Vances is hamstrung by 
Black Walder
 as he wrestles with Ser 
Harys Haigh
.
Crossbows take 
Donnel Locke
, 
Owen Norrey
, and half a dozen more. Young Ser 
Benfrey Frey
 seizes Dacey
Mormont by the arm, who smashes him in the face with a wine flagon. She runs for the door, but Ser Ryman comes
through with Frey men-at-arms and sinks his axe into Dacey's stomach.
Northmen begin pouring through the other door, and Catelyn takes them for rescue for half a heartbeat, until one of
them decapitates Smalljon. Catelyn realizes that she must try to intervene and save her son’s life, she sees a dagger
on the floor and crawls toward it, determined to kill Lord Walder. Then Robb stumbles to his feet, an arrow in his
chest in addition to the other two. Lord Walder who, in the midst of slaughter, sits on his throne watching greedily,
signals a halt to the music and mocks Robb. Catelyn grabs 
Jinglebell Frey
 and puts a dagger to the halfwit’s throat.
She begs Walder to spare her son, trade a son for a son. But the old man says, "that's a grandson... and he never was
much use."
A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood steps up to Robb, saying "Jaime Lannister sends his
regards." He thrusts his longsword through Robb's heart, and twists. Catelyn keeps her promise and slits the poor
halfwit's throat, and then begins to laugh and shout, while someone says, "she’s lost her wits,". Someone else says,
"Make an end," she is grabbed from behind and feels steel drawn across her own throat.

Tyrion
 receives the news that 
Robb
 and 
Catelyn Stark
 are dead. The end of the 
war
 is within reach and 
Lord Tywin
intends to be generous to 
Stark
 allies, but Joffrey wants all traitors executed and accuses his grandfather of
cowardice during 
Robert's Rebellion
. Tywin orders Joffrey to be escorted to his bedchamber, and Cersei leaves after
an unsuccessful attempt to defend him. On the Dornish issue, Tywin reveals that he will not sacrifice 
Gregor
Clegane
 to the 
Martells
. Tyrion is shocked, and Tywin explains his rationale at the time of the 
Sack of King’s
Landing
 and the murder of 
Elia Martell
 and her children. He also reveals that 
Arya Stark
 is still alive.
Synopsis
Tyrion
 and 
Sansa
 spend a joyless meal together, with both not talking much. Sansa takes a joke Tyrion makes about
the quality of the food as him criticizing her, but he assures her that it's not her fault and that he has more serious
matters to worry about. Besides 
Joffrey
, 
Cersei
 and 
his father
, what bothers him most are the 300 Dornishmen
visiting for the King's wedding. He has settled them in a cornerfort of the 
Red Keep
, as far away from the 
Tyrells
 as
possible, yet there has already been a brawl between Tyrell and 
Gargalen
 soldiers at 
Flea Bottom
, leaving one dead,
and a confrontation in the yard where 
Olenna Redwyne
 called 
Ellaria Sand
 "the serpent's whore", while 
Oberyn
Martell
 keeps asking for justice concerning the death of his sister 
Elia
 and her children every time he sees Tyrion.
However, Tyrion sees no point in bothering his already troubled young wife with any of this. After the meal, Sansa
asks for leave for her nightly visit to the 
godswood
. Although Tyrion finds Sansa's piety excessive, he allows it,
even offering to accompany her some time. She immediately objects to this, telling him he would be bored, as
praying to the 
old gods
 is mainly done in silence and without adornments. She knows him better than he imagined,
he thinks. He is tempted to ask what she prays for, but is afraid of what the answer would be.
He gets back to his tedious tasks as 
Master of Coin
, trying to make sense of some of the complicated numbers in the
ledgers 
Petyr Baelish
 left him. He considers some of Littlefinger's investments highly suspicious. Tyrion now regrets
that he consented so easily to the execution of the 
Antler Men
, as he has since learned that some of them owed the
Crown large sums and suspects that having 
Bronn
 try locating their heirs will be a futile effort. Ser 
Boros Blount
arrives, delivering a summons from Lord Tywin. Tyrion is glad to leave the books. Outside, rain is in the air, making
Tyrion concerned Sansa will get soaked at the godswood.
When he arrives at the 
Hand’s solar
, he finds King Joffrey, Queen Regent Cersei, Ser 
Kevan
 and Grand Maester
Pycelle
 there as well, besides his father. Joffrey is obviously elated, Cersei smiles smugly, yet Lord Tywin is his
usual grim self and Tyrion wonders whether his father can smile at all. Tyrion asks what has happened and is shown
a roll of parchment. The message reads: "
Roslin
 caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for
her wedding." Checking the seal, Tyrion realizes that the message comes from 
The Twins
. He asks whether Lord
Walder Frey
 thinks he is being poetic. He realizes that "trout" refers to 
Edmure Tully
, but before he can speculate on
the meaning of the "pair of wolf pelts", Joffrey announces that the message implies that 
Robb Stark
 is dead.
Tyrion's thoughts immediately drift to his wife, probably praying this very moment to her 
father's
 gods, for her
brother's victory and her 
mother's
 safety. It seems that neither the Old nor the 
New Gods
 are listening to prayer,
Tyrion thinks, wondering whether this should give him some comfort. He makes a glib comment about the kings
falling like leaves this autumn and their little war winning itself, prompting a poisonly sweet reply by Cersei that it's
in fact Lord Tywin who won the war. Lord Tywin doesn't consider the war over as long as enemies are in the field,

yet Cersei is optimistic that the lords of the 
Riverlands
, confronted with the combined powers of 
Highgarden
,
Casterly Rock
 and 
Dorne
 without the northmen to support them, will choose submission over destruction now. Lord
Tywin agrees that most will, except for 
Riverrun
 and probably 
Seagard
 and 
Raventree Hall
. However, 
Brynden
Tully
 won't dare to become a threat as long as Lord Frey keeps his nephew Edmure as hostage, and the 
Freys
 can
keep 
Jason Mallister
 penned up at his seat while 
Jonos Bracken
 might be bribed to change allegiance and attack the
Blackwoods
. In the end, everyone will bend their knees, Tywin predicts, and he is ready to offer generous terms. He
is going to spare every castle except one. Tyrion assumes that the exception will be 
Harrenhal
, which Lord Tywin
confirms, announcing that he has already commanded Ser 
Gregor Clegane
 to attack the castle and rid the realm of
the 
Brave Companions
. Tyrion is amused about his father exploiting the Mountain before he will be handed over to
the 
Martells
, yet the prospect of Littlefinger soon being able to take his seat at Harrenhal doesn't please him. He
wonders whether Lord Baelish has already arrived at the 
Vale
, wishing his ship sank instead.
King Joffrey doesn't agree with generous terms, insisting that all traitors should be executed instead. He wants Lord
Walder to send him Robb Stark's head, so that he can serve it to Sansa at his wedding feast. Ser Kevan is shocked
and reminds him that Sansa is now his aunt by marriage. Cersei tries to dismiss his statement, calling it a jest, yet
Joffrey insists. Tyrion angrily tells Joffrey that he can't torture Sansa any longer, calling him a monster, to which
Joffrey replies that Tyrion is the true monster. Tyrion counters that Joffrey should be concerned then, as monsters
are dangerous and kings are dying like flies already. Joffrey and Cersei are furious about Tyrion's threat, but Lord
Tywin scolds Joffrey instead, advising him that a king who feels the need to remind people of his power is no true
king. 
King Aerys
 never understood that, Lord Tywin says, as proven by his habit of having the tongues of people
like Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 ripped out, but Joffrey will. It's necessary to fight your enemies, but if they yield, generosity is
the right approach. Lord Tywin closes by telling Joffrey that the only head he should be concerned with right now is
Margaery Tyrell
's maidenhead.
Joffrey is sullen, then surprises everyone in the room by defying Lord Tywin, accusing him of having been afraid of
King Aerys. Tyrion thinks that things just got interesting. Cersei demands that Joffrey apologize to his grandfather,
yet he goes on, recounting how it was 
Robert Baratheon
 who fought 
Prince Rhaegar
 and won the crown while Lord
Tywin hid at Casterly Rock. A strong king acts boldly, he states. Lord Tywin is not amused, thanking the King
coldly for sharing his wisdom. He asks Ser Kevan to escort Joffrey to his bedchamber and Pycelle to give him some
dreamwine, completely ignoring Joffrey's protest. As Ser Kevan firmly guides Joffrey out and Pycelle follows,
Tyrion and Cersei remain, on their father's order. Cersei tries to apologize for Joffrey's behavior, calling him willful.
Lord Tywin thinks Joffrey is more stupid than willful and asks who put the idea into the boy's head that strong kings
act boldly. Cersei suggests it was Robert. Tyrion, glad to bring up that comment again, confirms that the part about
Tywin hiding in Casterly Rock sounded like something Robert would say. Cersei tries to play into this, but Lord
Tywin is upset that he might have fought a war to seat "Robert the Second" on the 
Iron Throne
 when Cersei has
been assuring him that the boy cared nothing for his father. He doesn't, Cersei insists, recounting how Robert cared
nothing for his son, would have beaten the boy if he could and hit him so hard once that Joffrey lost two teeth,
causing her to threaten Robert to kill him if he hit him again. Lord Tywin tells his daughter to leave, which she does
seethingly. Tyrion proposes that, rather than following his father's footsteps, Joffrey will become "
Aerys
 the Third".
Lord Tywin responds that he is only thirteen and still has time to grow, yet Tyrion notices that his father is more
upset than he wants to show. Lord Tywin announces that Joffrey needs a hard lesson, reminding Tyrion of the 
hard
lesson his father gave him when he was the same age
, which almost makes him feel sorry for Joffrey. However,
Tyrion can't think of anyone who'd deserve it more than Joffrey.
Tyrion gets back to the business of war. He congratulates his father, asking him how long he had been plotting with
Lord Walder. Lord Tywin objects to his son's choice of words. Tyrion retorts that he doesn't enjoy being left in the
dark. His father explains that nobody was told who didn't play a part in the execution, including Cersei, stressing
how important it is to keep secrets, especially in 
King’s Landing
. He wanted to get rid of a dangerous enemy as
cheaply as possible and that has been achieved, he announces, also suggesting that, while Tyrion has some talent for
cunning, he simply talks too much and his loose tongue will be his undoing one day. Tyrion jests that he should have
let Joffrey rip his tongue out then and Lord Tywin says he shouldn't tempt him.
The discussion moves on to the Dornish issue. Lord Tywin considers the presence of 
Oberyn Martell
 unfortunate,
describing him as half-mad while he believes 
Doran Martell
 to be a reasoned man who weighs the consequences of
words and actions. Tyrion asks whether it is true that Oberyn tried to continue 
the war
 on behalf of 
Viserys
Targaryen
. Lord Tywin confirms it, recounting how 
Jon Arryn
's negotiations with Prince Doran in 
Sunspear
 put an

end to the conspiracy with both sides deciding to remain silent about the issue afterwards, but distrust between King
Robert and House Martell remained. Tyrion proposes that showing Oberyn around in the brothels of the city could
ease the Red Viper's impatience, jesting that he won't be accused of not serving House Lannister where he is needed
most. Lord Tywin finds this comment very droll and asks whether Tyrion wants motley to be sewn for him,
prompting Tyrion's question as to whether he would be allowed to say anything he wants about King Joffrey if he
wore it. Lord Tywin declares that, while he had to suffer 
his father's
 follies, he won't suffer his son's.
Tyrion is more serious now, predicting that Oberyn will not be pleasant, nor satisfied with only receiving Gregor
Clegane's head. Lord Tywin reveals that he has no intention of sacrificing the Mountain, as he has served House
Lannister well and nobody is dreaded as much by their enemies. Tyrion is shocked; he thought that he and his father
agreed that the woods are full of beasts and that even Ser Gregor is disposable. He points out that Oberyn knows it
was the Mountain who killed his sister and her children. Oberyn knows nothing and has no proof, Lord Tywin
replies, he merely heard rumors and Ser Gregor is not likely to confirm them, in particular as Tywin will keep him
away for as long as the Dornishmen are in the city. If Oberyn raises the issue, Lord Tywin will claim the murderer
was Ser 
Amory Lorch
 – and the tale of Ser Amory's gruesome death by the hands of a bear set on him by 
Vargo
Hoat
 would even appease Oberyn, he expects. Tyrion objects to his father's sense of justice, but Tywin tells him that
it was in fact Ser Amory who found and killed Rhaegar's daughter 
Rhaenys
, also revealing that the child's mother
and baby brother 
Aegon
 were in the nursery below at the time. When Tyrion asks what he is going to tell Oberyn if
he inquires who gave the order for the murders, Lord Tywin answers that Ser Amory acted on his own in an attempt
to win the favor of the new king, as Robert's hatred of Rhaegar was well known. Thinking about it, Tyrion has to
concede that this version might serve its purpose, although he suspects that the Red Viper will not be happy.
Tyrion's suggestion that it would have been better for his father to let Robert commit the murders himself prompts
an astonished Lord Tywin to share his reasoning at the time of the 
Sack of King’s Landing
. He explains that they
came late to Robert’s cause, so they had to demonstrate their loyalty. When Tywin laid the bodies at the throne, it
was clear they had forsaken House Targaryen, and Robert was clearly relieved, knowing that Rhaegar’s children had
to die for his throne to be secure, but not wanting to kill them himself. Tywin admits that it was done too brutally,
and Elia did not need to be harmed. The Mountain only killed her because Tywin did not tell him to spare her.
Tywin asserts that at the time, he had greater concerns than the Dornish princess; Ned Stark’s van was rushing south
from 
the Trident
, and Tywin feared coming to battle with him, as well as the possibility of Aerys murdering 
Jaime
purely out of spite. "That, and what Jaime himself might do." He also did not know what Gregor Clegane was
capable of, only that he was huge and terrible in battle. He did not command Clegane to rape Elia, and Ser Amory
was almost as bestial with Rhaenys. When Tywin asked Ser Armory why it had required fifty thrusts to kill a girl of
two or three, he claimed she’d kicked him and would not stop screaming. He states that if Lorch had had any wits,
he would have calmed her with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow.
Tyrion asks whether it was a soft sweet pillow that killed Robb Stark. Lord Tywin reveals that the plan was to kill
Robb at his uncle's wedding with an arrow, as he was too circumspect in the field. Tyrion inquires about the fate of
Robb's mother. Lord Tywin suspects that the reference to "a pair of wolf pelts" in Lord Walder's message implies
that Lady Catelyn is dead, too. The original idea was to keep her as captive, but maybe something went wrong, he
suggests. Tyrion points out that the sacred guest right has been violated. Lord Tywin replies: "The blood is on
Walder Frey’s hands, not mine." Tyrion, describing him as an ill-natured old lecher who nourishes the slights he has
suffered over his long life, says he has no doubt that Lord Walder has planned the whole thing, yet he would never
have dared to go through with it if he hadn't been given the promise of protection. Tywin counters that refusing him
would have meant keeping him loyal to Robb Stark and prolonging the war. He considers the price that was paid
low: The Crown will grant Riverrun to 
Emmon Frey
 as soon as the Blackfish yields, while 
Lancel
 and 
Daven
Lannister
 have to marry Frey girls and 
Gerion Lannister
's bastard daughter 
Joy
 will be wedded to one of Lord
Walder's natural sons, once she is old enough. 
Roose Bolton
 becomes 
Warden of the North
 and his 
bastard son
 will
marry 
Arya Stark
.
The revelation that Lord Bolton was involved in the conspiracy is not particularly surprising to Tyrion, as Lord
Walder probably had not the stomach to act alone. However, he is baffled about the role assigned to Arya and points
out that neither 
Varys
 nor Ser 
Jacelyn Bywater
 were able to locate the girl, thus he is sure she is dead. Lord Tywin
replies: "So was 
Renly
, until the 
Blackwater
." Tyrion doesn't understand what this means. Lord Tywin replies that
Littlefinger might have succeeded where Tyrion and Varys failed. He suggests that the Boltons shall be fighting the
Ironborn
 for a few years while the Crown will keep an eye on their efforts to subjugate the Starks' other bannermen.

Lord Tywin expects that the remaining insurgents will be ready to yield by spring, also pointing out that the North
will eventually go to the son of Tyrion and Sansa. In this context, he reminds Tyrion that Joffrey is not the only one
who must take a maidenhead. Tyrion asks his father acidly when he believes his wife to be most fertile; before or
after he tells her that the Lannisters have killed her mother and brother.

 sewed the head of 
Robb Stark
's
direwolf, 
Grey Wind
, on the king's shoulders and nailed a crown on its head. 
Catelyn Stark
 was slain and thrown
naked into the river. Queen 
Selyse
 and 
Axell Florent
 declare that it was the hand of 
R'hllor
 that killed the usurpers,
but Stannis knows it was Lord 
Walder Frey
's handiwork. When Stannis wants to send word that he will pardon any
ironman
 or 
northman
 who swears fealty, 
Melisandre
 tells him that her flames revealed that new kings will pick up
where the old ones died. The 
Seven Kingdoms
 must be shown a sign, but Stannis has heard enough talk of stone
dragons, knowing of all the follies the 
Targaryens
 caused by trying to return the 
dragons
 to life.
Davos Seaworth
 persuades the king by asking Melisandre why she needs 
Edric Storm
's life to raise the stone dragon.
He also inquires how her leeches were responsible for two kings' deaths, when one was killed by Walder Frey and
the other, 
Balon Greyjoy
, fell from a bridge. He also points out that only two of the three false kings are dead so far.
The Red Woman has answers, but Stannis sends her away. Still not completely satisfied that he should spare Edric's
life, the king sends Davos away as well.
The Onion Knight seeks out Maester 
Pylos
, who has been teaching him how to read. Davos begins to slowly read a
letter that arrived some time before from the 
Wall
. The missive speaks of Lord 
Jeor Mormont
's 
defeat at the Fist
,
and Maester 
Aemon
's fear that the 
wildlings
 may conquer the Wall. Pylos reveals that he showed the letter to
Alester

Synopsis
Donal Noye
 and

 have done the best they could to fortify 
Castle Black
 from the 
impending attack
 of 
Styr
 and his
raiders. The castles along the Wall were designed defenseless, as the 
Night's Watch
 was not meant to be able to
repel a force from the South. Castle Black was meant specifically to be protected from 
wildlings
 by the 
Wall
 itself.
When 
Styr
, the 
Magnar
 of the 
Thenns
, and his men attack, many of the defenders die, while Jon and 
Satin
 fire
arrows from one of the roofs. At one point, Jon has 
Ygritte
 in his sights but he cannot loose an arrow at her.
Finally Donal Noye fires the powder kegs he had placed along the lower staircase of the Wall. The Magnar and the
rest of his men perish as the staircase and a section of ice from the Wall crushes them. Amidst the destruction, Jon
finds Ygritte, shot through the chest with a crossbow by someone else, and the woman he loved dies in his arms.

Nightfort

Bran
 recalls all the horror tales he’s heard about this castle, such as the stories of the 
Rat
Cook
, 
Mad Axe
, and the 
Night's King
. Before it was abandoned by the 
Watch
 some two hundred years before, the
Nightfort had once been the greatest castle along the Wall. However, 
Meera
 and 
Jojen Reed
 are unafraid of the
ancient castle. They sleep that night in the kitchens, near a seemingly bottomless well. Deep in the night, Bran is
woken by footsteps coming from the well. He awakens Meera, and then takes control of 
Hodor

when he enters 
Summer

But it is only 
Sam
 and 
Gilly
 who emerge from the well, carrying Gilly’s infant son. Gilly asks them if they are the
ones 
Coldhands
 was sent to find, but Bran has no idea what she is speaking of. Meera asks them how they got past
the Wall
, and Sam reveals that Coldhands had led them to the 
Black Gate
, which only a brother of the Night’s
Watch can open. Sam describes Coldhands as dressed all in black like a sworn brother, but his skin and the cold
from his body reminded Sam of a 
wight
. But Coldhands could speak, his eyes did not burn blue, and he and his
ravens had saved them from the wights. When the Reeds inquire why Coldhands wasn’t with them, Sam tells them
that the Wall was more than just ice and stone, there were ancient spells woven into it, and the Wall would not let
Coldhands pass. Jojen tells Sam that Bran is the one Coldhands seeks. Tarly realizes who Bran is, but promises not
to tell anyone of Bran’s whereabouts on his honor and his friendship with 
Jon
.
Jojen has Sam bring them to the Black Gate, which is an ancient white 
weirwood
 growing beneath the Wall and the
Nightfort. The face in the weirwood speaks, and Sam answers by reciting his oath; the weirwood permits them to
pass by opening its mouth, and as Bran and the others leave Sam behind, the boy feels a drop of water fall on him, a
drop as salty as a tear…

During the feast, Joffrey calls for the royal jousters, and the party is entertained as two dwarfs battle each other.
Joffrey then mocks his uncle, commanding Tyrion to fight the dwarfs as the king’s champion. Tyrion rebuffs him,
but the King dumps a huge goblet of wine over Tyrion’s head. Joffrey commands Tyrion to serve him wine, and the
hall erupts in laughter. Tyrion refills the goblet, and then the pigeon pie is brought out, and Joffrey calls for Ser
Ilyn’s
 sword. Sansa is horrified to learn that the King’s Justice no longer holds her father’s greatsword, 
Ice
.
Joffrey calls for more wine, Margaery at his side, and then begins to eat some of Tyrion’s pie. He commands Tyrion
to serve him more wine, which Tyrion does. The King then begins to cough, unable to breathe as he claws at his
throat. Lady Olenna and Margaery call out for help, but the 
Kingsguard
 are powerless to do anything. As Grand
Maester 
Pycelle
 calls for his potions, Tyrion dumps the rest of the wine out on the floor, and Joffrey, now turning
black, seems to either reach for--or point at--his uncle. 
Sansa
 has slipped off during the confusion, but when 
Cersei
finally lets go of her son’s lifeless body, she commands the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion for murdering the King.

Synopsis
Sansa
 has fled to the 
Godswood
, and when she removes her hairnet, she notices that one of the black amethysts is
missing. 
Dontos
 told her she must wear it for the wedding feast, but she now remembers that the amethysts are from
Asshai
, and that Dontos called the hairnet “magic”. Dontos then appears in the godswood, and Sansa accuses him of
murdering the 
King
 by using one of the amethysts. Dontos denies it, telling her 
Tyrion
 has already been arrested for
poisoning the King. She dresses under a heavy cloak, and Dontos leads her to a secret stairway down to the river.
They are rowed out to a ship, and Sansa is shocked to find 
Littlefinger
 on board. When Dontos calls for his reward
of ten thousand 
gold dragons
, Littlefinger commands 
Lothor Brune
 to kill the drunk.
Littlefinger explains to her that the fool sold her for a promise of gold, and once he drank that up he would sell her
whereabouts to the 
Queen
 for more gold. He reveals that it was he who wrote the note so long ago, asking her to go
to the godswood. Littlefinger also planned for the dwarf jousters at the wedding, and Sansa asks him why he should
wish Joffrey dead. Littlefinger responds, "I had no motive. Always keep your foes confused. Sometimes the best
way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose…Remember that when you come to play the game of
thrones." He claims he had 
her mother
's maidenhood and tells her that she could have been his daughter, had he and
Catelyn wed, and therefore he must look out for Sansa.

Synopsis
At an unnamed inn on the road to 
King's Landing
, 
Jaime
 hears that the king is dead, 
his firstborn son
, but he is more
concerned about 
Cersei
. Jaime and 
Brienne
 have already learned of 
Robb Stark
’s demise, and found out that Lord
Clement Piper
 rode to King’s Landing to bend the knee since his son 
Marq
 is held captive at the 
Twins
. When they
arrive at the 
Red Keep
, Ser 
Loras
 confronts Brienne, accusing her of killing 
Renly
. Jaime reminds the Knight of
Flowers that he is his Lord Commander and orders him to sheathe his sword, but has Brienne arrested and taken to a
tower cell.
Jaime finds Cersei in the castle 
sept
, where 
Joffrey
 is lying in state, and shows her his stump. She asks him to kill
Tyrion
 for murdering Joffrey. Despite Cersei’s words that Tyrion threatened her when she held 
Alayaya
 prisoner,
Jaime tells her he wishes to learn more about what happened. He has sex with her on the Mother's altar, and
afterwards Cersei calls it folly, saying that they must be more careful with their father in the castle. He responds that
they should stop hiding their love and wed, even if 
Tommen
 would lose the 
Iron Throne
, he would still be heir to
Casterly Rock
, but she sends him away in anger.
Jaime then visits his father, and Lord 
Tywin
 is furious when he learns that 
Vargo Hoat
 maimed his son. The 
Hand of
the King
 reveals that the 
Bloody Mummers
 were routed at 
Harrenhal
, and that 
Gregor Clegane
 will kill the Goat
soon but is using him for amusement in the meantime. Tywin then speaks of his plans to bribe the 
High Septon
 to
release Jaime of his vows to the Kingsguard, find a new husband for Cersei, and perhaps marry Jaime to 
Margaery
.
Jaime vehemently refuses to hear of it, stating that he is a knight of the 
Kingsguard
, and that’s all he means to be.
Lord Tywin turns from his son in disgust, saying, "You are not my son. You say you are Lord Commander of the
Kingsguard. Very well, ser. Go do your duty."

Tyrion X
Synopsis
Tyrion Lannister
 is imprisoned in a tower cell of the 
Red Keep
. His uncle 
Kevan
 tells him that 
Tywin
, 
Mace Tyrell
,
and 
Oberyn Martell
 will stand in judgment of him. When Tyrion claims he may demand 
trial by combat
, his uncle
replies that 
Cersei
 will name 
Gregor Clegane
 as her champion. Tyrion sends for 
Bronn
, but finds the former
sellsword
 to be a changed man, soon to marry 
Lollys Stokeworth
, and now being paid well by the Queen. The
mercenary leaves Tyrion to fend for himself, unwilling to stand for the dwarf against the Mountain.
At the trial, Tyrion declares his innocence, and claims that 
Sansa
 was not responsible either. The witnesses that
Cersei has brought forth are numerous, and since Tyrion has no witnesses of his own, their word is without refute.
Pycelle
 notes that Tyrion stole poisons from his solar, and 
Taena Merryweather
 claims to have seen Tyrion drop
something into the 
King
’s wine.
That night, Kevan tells Tyrion that his only hope is to admit his guilt and he will be permitted to 
take the black
,
though Tyrion, remembering what happened to the 
last man
 to be made such an offer, is dismissive. They talk about
Tyrion's father. Kevan is fiercely loyal to his brother, for it was Tywin who made the Lannisters' enemies pay for
their abuse of their father 
Tytos Lannister
, who was a peaceful but weak man. The next morning, 
Varys
 nearly seals
Tyrion’s fate with damaging evidence against the dwarf.
Later, Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion, and makes it clear that Cersei has tried to buy his vote in the judgment,
mentioning marriage. But the Red Viper has other ideas, and even brings up the point that according to Dornish law,
Myrcella
 is the heir, and that 
his brother
 may well crown his ward. Oberyn relates the story Tywin had told him that
it was 
Amory Lorch
 who killed 
Elia
 and her children, but Tyrion tells him the truth--that Lorch only killed 
Rhaenys
,
and it was the Mountain who killed 
Aegon
 and raped and murdered Elia. The Red Viper speaks of saving Tyrion,
not as his judge, but as his champion.

Jaime IX
Synopsis
Jaime
 is looking through the 
White Book
, the history of the 
Kingsguard
, updated throughout the ages by the Lord
Commander. We learn much about 
Barristan Selmy
, who gained the title ‘the Bold’ when he was just ten, riding as a
mystery knight
 in a tourney at 
Blackhaven
, where he was unmasked by the 
Prince of Dragonflies
. Barristan was
knighted at sixteen by King 
Aegon V
, and named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year by 
Gerold Hightower
.
The deeds and legends of Barristan the Bold are not lost on Jaime. He recalls the awesome fight between the 
Sword
of the Morning
 and the 
Smiling Knight
 of the 
Kingswood Brotherhood
, and thinks of his own childhood wishes:
That boy had wanted to be Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead.
Jaime then receives the five Kingsguard currently under his command, and tests each of them. He mocks 
Boros
Blount
 for his cowardice and inability to protect Prince 
Tommen
, and tells him that from here on in, Blount will
taste all the King’s food. Blount storms from the room, and Jaime goes after 
Osmund Kettleblack
. Disgusted that an
upjumped 
sellsword
 with no reputation has been named to the Kingsguard, Jaime at least concedes that the man
probably knows how to fight.
Having heard the details of the Kingsguard's willingness to beat 
Sansa Stark
 on Joffrey's orders, Jaime commands
Meryn Trant
 to temper his obedience to the king while the king remains a boy, and to obey the 
Queen Regent
, the
Hand
, and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard instead. He gets 
Balon Swann
 to swear he will remain true to the
Crown, even though his 
father
 and 
brother
’s allegiance are in question.
Lastly, he questions 
Loras Tyrell
, and finds the Knight of Flowers as cocky as he himself was in his youth. Jaime
asks Loras about the supposed ghost of 
Renly Baratheon
 that fought at the 
Battle of the Blackwater
 at the van of his
father's forces, obtaining an admission that it was 
Garlan Tyrell
 inside the armor. Then he confronts Loras about
Brienne
, and commands him to judge the woman fairly, on his honour as a knight.
Considering Jaime’s words about 
Renly
’s death, Ser Loras nearly breaks down, stating, "
When I saw him all bloody,
with her fled ... if she’s innocent, then 
Robar
 and 
Emmon
…
" Jaime absolves him of killing the two 
Rainbow Guard
in a rage, and then sits alone in the room, contemplating the other debts he still has to pay.

Sansa
 is alarmed to discover that

Vale of Arryn
. They land at 
the tiny tower
 of 
House Baelish
 that Petyr is lord of, and he stresses that Sansa must use
a new name, calling her 
Alayne Stone
 so that no one will know who she really is.
She learns that 
Oswell
 is actually the 
Kettleblacks
' father, and Littlefinger leads her to discern that it was the 
Queen
of Thorns
 who poisoned 
Joffrey
 when she took one of the amethysts from Sansa's hair net. All the plans were
arranged by Littlefinger, who met Lady Olenna when he brokered the alliance that joined 
Highgarden
 and 
House
Lannister
.
Soon after, 
Lysa Arryn
 arrives with a small retinue, and she insists that Petyr wed her now at his tower instead of the
Eyrie
. Lysa wants to make another child with Petyr, after 
her father
 aborted the first child years ago. A drunken
Marillion
 tries to seduce Sansa that night, but 
Lothor Brune
 forces him away. The next morning, Petyr tells Alayne
that Lysa now knows the girl's identity. Lysa does not like having Sansa around, although she does wish to marry
her niece to her son,

Synopsis
Tyrion
 wakes up in the morning and readies himself to go to the trial. He considers admitting guilt or demanding a
trial by battle. He asks his squire if he thinks that Tyrion did it. 
Podrick
 hesitates and sputters.
Cersei
's last witness turns out to be 
Shae
. She accuses Tyrion and 
Sansa
 of the murder. She tells the assembled court
that she was an innocent girl before Tyrion abused her and turned her into his whore. When Shae lies how Tyrion
made her call him 
"Giant of Lannister"
, the public starts to laugh. Furiously, Tyrion tells them to take Shae away
and let him confess. Instead he demands a trial by battle. As Cersei's champion is the formidable Ser 
Gregor
Clegane
, she insist that the judges grant Tyrion's request. 
Mace Tyrell
, one of the judges, asks Tyrion who his
champion is. To the consternation of the court it is 
Oberyn Martell
, another judge. 
Tywin
 is angry but grants
Tyrion's request and sets the date for the battle on the next morrow.
The next morning Tyrion is given leave to visit his champion. Oberyn plans to fight with a spear and use only light
armor. He specifically warns Tyrion not to touch the weapon. He is full of confidence but Tyrion is not sure of his
choice of weapon. Oberyn invites Tyrion to go to 
Dorne
 after the trial and talks about crowning 
Myrcella
. Then he
changes the subject to the time he visited 
Lannisport
 with his mother and 
sister
.
His mother and 
Tyrion's mother
 were friends and were planning on marrying 
Jaime
 to Elia and/or Cersei to Oberyn.
When they arrived at 
Casterly Rock
, Joanna had died and Tywin refused both suggestions and said that Cersei was
intended for Prince 
Rhaegar Targaryen
. Later Elia married prince Rhaegar. Oberyn thinks that this is why Tywin
had Elia killed. 
Oberyn proclaims that today he will have justice for Elia and her children.
The combat is held in the outer ward. As soon as the fight begins, Oberyn starts to accuse Gregor of Elia's rape and
murder. By using a spear as his weapon Oberyn has the advantage of being able to reach his enemy, and because he
is only lightly armored he is fast enough to remain out of Gregor's reach. Oberyn manages to wound his enemy
severely, disarming him and knocking him onto the ground. Before Oberyn can finish his opponent, Gregor grabs
Oberyn by the leg and drags him down. With his bare hands Gregor smashes Oberyn's teeth, crushes his head, and
kills him, all while admiting to the murder and rape of Elia and the murder of her children. Tyrion realizes that he is
condemned when the 
Gold Cloaks
 take him to the 
black cells
.

Synopsis
Daenerys
 sits in the great pyramid of 
Meereen
, her troops having conquered the city after the men she sent into the
sewers opened the gates. She meets an envoy from 
Astapor
, who represents King 
Cleon
 the great, a former butcher
who now rules Astapor, supposedly in Dany’s name. But the envoy suggests that King Cleon wishes to marry Dany,
and that the men she left to rule Astapor have all been deposed. Cleon has amassed new slaves, and is beginning to
train them as 
Unsullied
, and Daenerys is dismayed that all she has done to free Astapor of slavery is coming undone.
Finally, she sends for Ser 
Jorah
 and Ser 
Barristan
, wishing the two had died in the sewers, but the two knights are
greater warriors than even that suicide quest. Barristan speaks of things Daenerys was never aware of, that 
her father
was mad, and that 
Viserys
, even as a young boy, seemed to be 
more like his father
 than his brother 
Rhaegar
. The old
knight tells her,
The Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. King 
Jaehaerys
 once told me that madness and
greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a 
Targaryen
 is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the
world holds its breath to see how it will land.
She absolves Barristan, and he swears his sword to her cause. But Ser Jorah does not beg forgiveness, and remains
defensive, insisting that he has done nothing wrong. Daenerys then exiles the knight who was once her closest friend
and protector, threatening to kill him if she ever sees him again.
Later, 
Daario
 warns her that she should not have banished Jorah, and that she may come to regret not keeping him
near or having him killed outright. When her advisors urge her to move on, Daenerys decides that she must learn to
rule if she ever wishes to sit the throne of 
Westeros
, and she declares that she will stay in Meereen and rule as queen.

A Feast for Crows
Jaime I
Synopsis
Jaime
 is seated with the 
small council
, as King 
Tommen
 signs all the papers brought before him by Ser 
Kevan
. The
Lannisters
 are granting 
Riverrun
 to Ser 
Emmon Frey
 and Kevan's sister 
Genna
, once the 
Blackfish
 has surrendered.
They legitimize 
Ramsay Snow
 and name 
Roose Bolton
 
Warden of the North
. Ser 
Rolph Spicer
 is granted
Castamere
, and raised to lord, and Lord 
Gawen Westerling
, 
his wife
, and daughter 
Jeyne
 are all granted a royal
pardon, along with Lord 
Jonos Bracken
, Lord 
Vance
, Lord 
Goodbrook
 and Lord 
Mooton
 for entering King
Tommen's service. Jaime had recently lost during a spar with Ser 
Addam Marbrand
, and is disgusted that he cannot
fight left-handed, especially after receiving the new 
Valyrian sword
 from 
his father
.
Outside, Jaime watches Steelshanks 
Walton
 and his men prepare to leave 
King's Landing
, and sees a girl who claims
to be 
Arya Stark
. Jaime is pretty sure she is not the real Arya, yet she is to be presented to Roose Bolton and Ramsay
Bolton at the 
Dreadfort
. Ser 
Gregor
's screams from 
Pycelle
's solar can be heard throughout the 
Red Keep
, for Lord
Tywin has demanded that the Grand Maester heal him so that the 
King's Justice
 can execute him (rather than dying
from a poisoned spear) in the hopes of placating 
Dorne
 and 
House Martell
, who are likely to be outraged by Prince
Oberyn's
 death. Jaime recalls his father mentioning that 
Stannis
 and his fleet have left 
Dragonstone
, leaving only a
token force to guard the island. Unlike Pycelle, Tywin believes Stannis has not conceded defeat; he has only left
Dragonstone because he intends to continue fighting elsewhere. He will likely fail if he goes to 
Storm's End
 and tries
to rally the Stormlands, but if Stannis wins Dorne to his cause, he can prolong 
the war
 for months or even years, so
Tywin will not give Dorne any reason to side with Stannis.
Later, 
Cersei
 visits him in the 
White Sword Tower
, and reveals that their father plans to send her back to 
Casterly
Rock
 so that he will have a free hand in raising Tommen, in addition to marrying Tommen to 
Margaery Tyrell
, but
Jaime refuses to talk to their father to convince him otherwise. Their conversation turns to the subject of 
Bran Stark
;
Cersei berates him again for throwing the boy from the tower, but when Jaime questions her about 
the assassin
Catelyn Stark
 accused them of sending after the boy, Cersei denies it. When Cersei mentions that 
Robert
 himself, at
Winterfell
, said it would be kinder to put the boy out of his misery while alone with her and their children, Jaime
figures out that it was 
Joffrey
, 'desperate for a pat on the head from that sot', who sent the assassin to kill 
Bran
, even
though Cersei does not believe him when he tells her his suspicions, just as Jaime does not believe her when Cersei
insists again that 
Tyrion
 is responsible for Joffrey's death. When she begins to unlace Jaime's breeches, he sends her
off in anger.
Jaime then has 
Brienne
 and Ser 
Loras
 brought before him, and the Knight of Flowers reveals that after speaking
with the woman, he now believes she may be innocent. Ser Loras is dismissed, and Jaime reveals his belief that
Tyrion is innocent, and that the girl sent north with Steelshanks was not the real Arya Stark; his father has found
some 
northern girl of a similar age and appearance
, and with her immediate family dead or missing, there is no one
to say otherwise. Ser Jaime then commands Brienne to find and protect Lady Catelyn's daughters, as they had both
pledged to do, and gives her the Valyrian sword he had so recently received from his father, explaining that it was
forged from the metal taken from 
Eddard Stark
's greatsword 
Ice
, melted down after his execution, saying, "
A sword
so fine must bear a name. It would please me if you would call this one '

Synopsis
Jon
 is taken out of his ice cell and brought once again before 
Janos Slynt
, and told that only Maester 
Aemon
 is
preventing Janos from hanging Jon. Janos reveals that he will give Jon one last chance to prove his innocence,
sending him to meet 
Mance Rayder
 as an envoy, but Jon must kill the 
wildling
 king. 
Beyond the Wall
, Jon meets
Tormund
 who treats him with respect, almost as a friend. Jon is brought before Mance, and the king reveals that he
is aware that the 
Night's Watch
 is nearly out of provisions and cannot hold out much longer.
Rayder then brings him to see the 
Horn of Winter
, which Mance claims they found back in the 
Frostfangs
, but only
he and his trusted lieutenants knew about it. However, Mance does not wish to use the Horn, for if the songs can be
believed, it will cause the Wall to collapse. The wildlings have come south not to conquer, but to escape the 
Others
.
Without the Wall, Mance’s people would find no safe haven, even in the south, and that is something he does not
wish to happen. Mance offers Jon the Horn of Winter if the Night’s Watch will let his people pass the Wall and
settle the lands to the south, although he will not abide the laws or taxes of the 
Seven Kingdoms
. If the Watch
refuses, Tormund Giantsbane will sound the 
Horn of Joramun
 in three days time.
However, the parley is interrupted, as the wildlings have 
come under attack
 from the east by rangers from
Eastwatch
. Mance believes that it must be 
Cotter Pyke
, but a scout and 
Varamyr
, who is skinchanged inside 
Orell
's
eagle, tell Mance there are more iron-clad attackers coming from the north and east. When Orell's eagle bursts into
flames, Varamyr runs screaming from the fray. 
Harma Dogshead's
 raiders charge through the rangers, but they are
overwhelmed by 
knights
 on heavy horse. Amongst their banners, Jon sees a 
seahorse
, a 
field of birds
, and a 
ring of
flowers
. Mance is surrounded and captured, and Harma's head is waved on a pole. After hearing the knights shout
"
Stannis
!", Jon enters Mance’s tent where 
Dalla
 is giving birth with the assistance of 
Val
.

Synopsis
Sandor
 and 
Arya
 come to the 
Inn at the Crossroads
. To her dismay, she recognizes 
Polliver
 and the 
Tickler
 and 
a
squire
. The squire tries to bait Sandor with insults about fleeing King's Landing and the room is very tense. The
Hound demands wine, which the innkeeper brings and Sandor gulps down. Sandor warns the innkeeper that Polliver
and the Tickler will kill him instead of paying for their drinks, and the innkeeper and the other people in the room
leave.
The 
Tickler
 tells Sandor what has happened in the realm, including 
Tyrion's
 marriage, 
Joffrey's
 death and Tyrion's
imprisonment. He claims that 
Sansa's
 sister has been found and is to marry 
Ramsay Bolton
, 
Harrenhal
 has been
taken by 
Gregor Clegane
, 
Riverrun
 is under siege by the 
Lannisters
 and 
Randyll Tarly
 has taken 
Saltpans
. He says
only the Blackwoods are still holding out, and the Brackens are fighting them around 
Raventree Hall
.
The Tickler says Gregor would prefer that Sandor come back with them to Harrenhal, but when Sandor refuses, the
Tickler throws a knife at him. Sandor, the Tickler and Polliver all draw swords and begin to fight. The squire tries to
join in but Arya throws a cup at him and knocks him down. Sandor is not fighting his best and Arya realizes he
drank his wine too fast and is drunk. During the fight Arya stabs the squire in the belly and then sneaks up behind
the Tickler and stabs him over and over again in a rage until Sandor stops her. The squire is still alive but was
mortally wounded and asks for mercy. Sandor tells Arya to give him mercy, and asks if she remembers where the
heart is. She does. She recovers 
Needle
, which was carried by Polliver, and kills the squire.
Sandor, seriously wounded, says Gregor must hold the ford and that they will make for Saltpans and find a ship to
the 
Vale
. They leave the inn to travel on but the Hound is so wounded that he needs tending and they stop. The next
day he is so weak that he falls out of his saddle. While he lies in a fevered sleep, Arya thinks about killing him. He
wakes to see what she is contemplating and urges her to do it - to give him mercy - but Arya leaves him and rides on
to Saltpans.
She tries to find a boat that goes to the North but only finds a trading ship 
Titan's Daughter
 with 
Braavos
 as its
destination. She doesn't have enough money to get on board but then she shows the captain the coin she got from
Jaqen H'ghar
 and says "
Valar Morghulis
", which causes him to give her both a cabin and passage.

Synopsis
At 
Castle Black
, 
Gilly
 is nursing both her own son as well as 
Mance Rayder
's, as 
Dalla
 died giving birth. 
Sam
 and
Gilly have recently returned to Castle Black, meeting up with Ser 
Denys Mallister
 and the men from the 
Shadow
Tower
. They also joined with 
Dywen
, 
Edd
 and 
Giant
, survivors from the Bridge of Skulls where 
Bowen Marsh
 held
back the 
Weeper
's advance. Sam is happy to be reunited with 
Jon
, although he is wary of King 
Stannis
's army being
present at Castle Black. It was the king who defeated the 
wildlings
, scattering their remnants back into the 
haunted
forest
. 
Val
 wants to bring her sister's baby to Mance, but Jon tells her that only Maester 
Aemon
 is permitted to see
the imprisoned wildling king. Alone, Sam asks Jon, "Could there be honor in a lie, if it were told for a good
purpose?" Sam is considering sending Gilly and her son to 
Horn Hill
, with a letter claiming that he fathered the boy.
Jon reveals that 
Slynt
 still considers him a traitor, because he did not kill Mance as he was sent to do. Sam
remembers swearing to 
Bran
 and 
Jojen Reed
 not to reveal to anyone, even Jon, that Bran is still alive. 
Coldhands
'
last words to Sam were, "Let the world believe the boy is dead. We want no seekers coming after us. Swear it,
Samwell of the Night's Watch. Swear it for the life you owe me." And Sam has kept his vows to all three. Later,
Sam considers the last vote for a new Lord Commander, with Ser Denys Mallister still leading, but no one near the
majority. At dinner, Bowen Marsh withdraws his name from the voting, and backs Janos Slynt. When the votes are
tallied that night, both Ser Denys and 
Cotter Pyke
 have lost votes, and Slynt has gained on both of them. Sitting with
Grenn
, 
Pyp
 and Dolorous Edd, Pyp suggests that if Sam were to persuade either Ser Denys or Cotter Pyke to set
aside their quarrels and back the other, a new Lord Commander could be decided. Preferably one who would be
beneficial to the Watch, so long as it was not Janos Slynt.

Synopsis
Jon
 is training with 
Satin
 in the yard, when 
Melisandre
 arrives to take him before 
Stannis
. The King does not believe
Jon is a traitor, for he knew 
Janos Slynt
 as well as 
Ned Stark
. Stannis knew Ned to be a man of honor, and trusts Jon,
saying it was Jon who found the 
dragonglass
 dagger that 
Samwell Tarly
 used to kill the 
Other
, and Jon who brought
them the 
Horn of Winter
 and captured Mance’s son. At every step of Stannis' speech, Jon clarifies whom he credits
with doing the actual deeds. Stannis asks Jon if there is honor in 
Mance Rayder
, and the young man claims there is.
The King speaks of the war that Melisandre has seen in her flames, and he confides that Jon may have a part in the
upcoming battle. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and name him Lord of 
Winterfell
, a goal he considers especially
important due to all the strife occurring in 
the North
. Stannis intends to let the 
wildlings
 through 
the Wall
, and settle
them in the 
Gift
, should they pledge fealty and accept the 
Lord of Light
 as their god. He also presumes to marry his
loyal Lord of Winterfell to 
Val
 to solidify his peace with the wildlings, however Jon would have to adopt Stannis'
faith and burn the godswood of Winterfell. Jon asks for time to consider the offer, and Stannis agrees.

Tyrion I
Synopsis
Tyrion
, locked in the 
black cells
 beneath the 
Red Keep
, is rescued by 
Jaime
. His brother tells him that he is to be
beheaded on the morrow, and informs him that he coerced 
Varys
 into helping him charter a ship to take Tyrion from
King's Landing
. When Jaime tells him that the rescue was a debt he owed him, Tyrion presses his brother, and learns
that 
Tysha
 was not a whore, but a crofter’s daughter, just as she appeared. Lord 
Tywin
 had forced Jaime all those
years ago to lie about Tysha so as to teach Tyrion a lesson. Tyrion is infuriated that his brother never told him the
truth, and punches Jaime in the face. Tyrion warns him that he will exact revenge against him, 
their father
, and
Cersei
, as a 
Lannister
 always pays his debts. Jaime then asks if Tyrion poisoned 
Joffrey
 and, lying in his anger,
Tyrion admits to doing so. He also tells Jaime that Cersei is sleeping with 
Lancel
 and Ser 
Osmund
 and perhaps
others, and that Joffrey would have been a monster worse than 
Aerys
 if he remained king.
Tyrion stalks off without a further word, and confronts Varys for his betrayal. The eunuch concedes that he cannot
find a trace of 
Sansa
, then leads him deeper down, to the fourth level where 
Maegor
 had built torture chambers.
When they come to a circular tower chamber with a ladder leading up, Tyrion realizes it leads up to the 
Tower of the
Hand
. Commanding Varys to wait for him, Tyrion ascends the wickedly high ladder. It leads to a secret passage
behind the rooms in the Tower, perfect for Varys’ "little birds" to overhear everything going on in the Hand’s
quarters. He opens the secret door to his old chamber, and finds 
Shae
 naked in his father’s bed, with the Hand’s
chain of office around her neck. The whore pleads that the Queen made her say all those things against him in court,
but Tyrion strangles her with the chain he once wore. Grabbing a crossbow off the wall, he finds his father in the
privy. Tywin commands him to put down the crossbow, promising that he had no intention of carrying out the
sentence, and would allow Tyrion to take 
the black
. Disbelieving his father, Tyrion questions him as to what became
of Tysha. Lord Tywin reveals he did not have her killed, and doesn't know exactly what became of her. Tywin says
he supposed the steward sent the "whore" on her way. Tyrion then asks where the steward might have sent her and
Lord Tywin replies "Wherever whores go". Tyrion fires the crossbow sending the bolt into his father’s pelvis, killing
Lord Tywin.

Synopsis
King 
Stannis
 has brought several of the 
black brothers
 before him to make known his anger about them taking too
long to select a new Lord Commander. Stannis sees through 
Janos Slynt
’s fawning, having known the man as a
bribe-taker in 
King's Landing
. The king makes it clear that after they finally vote in a new Lord Commander, he
plans to take all the castles along 
the Wall
, except for the three currently occupied by the 
Watch
, to garrison his
forces. He also plans to either take or be granted the 
Gift
, stating that he intends to help the Watch guard the Wall.
He commands the builders to deliver reports on the conditions of the abandoned castles, and informs the men
gathered that nightfires will be lit before the gates of all the castles. When 
Melisandre
 mentions the impending war,
Maester 
Aemon
 is aware that she speaks of the prophesied War for the Dawn. After the others have left, Aemon
asks to see the fabled sword 
Lightbringer
 through Sam’s eyes. 
Sam
 describes the sword as glowing, yet there are no
flames.
Stannis questions Sam about 
dragonglass
, making it known that there are great deposits of obsidian beneath
Dragonstone
, and that he intends to have it mined and brought to the Wall. The king asks Sam to show him the
Black Gate
, as he intends to make the 
Nightfort
 his seat, and Sam agrees although he is not sure if the gate will open
for a man not of the black. When they leave, Maester Aemon asks Sam if he felt any heat emanating from the sword,
and he realizes that he did not. Aemon speaks of the choosing, subtly implying that Sam could do something to help
speed the process. Determined to put aside the bickering between the two leading candidates, Sam speaks with both
Cotter Pyke
 and Ser 
Denys Mallister
 individually. Both are aware they will not be elected and agree that Slynt
would be a bad choice. So Sam asks them if they would step aside if the right candidate were to be named. Playing
one off the other, using their dislike for each other, Sam sets it up so that each man will lend his support to 
Jon
 that
night.

Synopsis
Jon
 practices swords in the yard with 
Iron Emmett
, another brother of the Night's Watch. Emmett hits Jon hard and
Jon is knocked into thoughts of 
Winterfell
 and his boyhood rivalry with Robb. Part of him always wanted to become
Lord of Winterfell and resented that it was impossible for him. These feelings come up so strong that he beats
Emmett mercilessly and has to be pulled off him. Jon goes to the bathhouse, and overhears Ser 
Alliser
 and 
Bowen
Marsh
 mentioning that Lord 
Tywin
 sent a letter backing 
Janos Slynt
’s rise to Lord Commander. They show it to
Othell Yarwyck
, seeking to have the First Builder withdraw and back Slynt. Jon is disturbed by the prospect of Slynt
becoming Lord Commander, and goes off through the gate beyond 
the Wall
. He is torn between his duties to the
Watch, and the chance 
Stannis
 has given him to become Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. As he is considering that he
has always wanted this, his thoughts change to a hunger for food. No, not food but prey - deer or elk. When he looks
up, 
Ghost
 comes padding over. He is overjoyed to see his old friend.
Jon looks at the direwolf’s red eyes. Recalling what 
Melisandre
 said about there being no 
old gods
, only the 
Lord of
Light
 and the Other, Jon realizes that while Ghost's eyes are red, they are not like Melisandre’s. He has a
weirwood’s
 eyes and belongs to the old gods. His mind made up, he attends the voting council for the first time. He
is greeted with shouts of disapproval from Slynt and Thorne, learning that his name has been put forth as Lord
Commander. Seeking to end the voting, Ser Alliser mentions that Othell Yarwyck has something to say, but the First
Builder abandons their plotting, and withdraws in favor of Jon. When 
Sam
 and 
Clydas
 go to fetch the voting kettle, a
large raven flies out and lands on Jon’s shoulder, cawing, "Snow. Snow." The 
Black Brothers
 are amazed when they
realize the bird is 
Mormont's raven
. Jon Snow wins the vote in a landslide victory and is named the 998th Lord
Commander, but he must soon confront Stannis with the news.

Synopsis
At the

, 
Sansa
 awakens to find it snowing outside. She wanders outside and begins to sculpt a snow castle,
slowly forming it into a replica of 
Winterfell
. 
Littlefinger
 finds her in the garden and helps her finish the castle. He
tells her she is even more beautiful than 
her mother
 was at her age, and then proceeds to kiss her. Sansa is shocked
by Lord Baelish’s action, but for half a heartbeat she yields. She tries to make him stop and then young 
Robert
approaches interrupting them. Robert begins to destroy the snow castle with his ragged doll. Sansa reacts by
grabbing the doll which causes it to tear in half. This in turn causes her cousin to begin shaking violently. Maester
Colemon
 is called to bring the boy for a leeching, in an attempt to cure the fit.
Sansa is brought before her aunt, but 
Lysa
 is not concerned about her son’s seizure, but rather Sansa kissing Petyr.
Lysa accuses her of trying to seduce her husband, just like her mother had tried to "steal" Petyr from her. Lady
Arryn then relates the story of how one night when they had all gotten drunk, Catelyn spurned Littlefinger, and Lysa
had gone to his bed afterward to comfort him, even though he had called her Cat. Lysa continues to rant about how
her father
 took their baby away from them, and then grabs Sansa and drags her before the 
Moon Door
 while calling
for 
Marillion
. Lysa pushes her closer and closer to the edge, until Littlefinger arrives and tells his new wife to
release her.
Lysa, bordering on insanity, reveals how she had persuaded 
Jon Arryn
 to get Littlefinger his first post, and how she
had done as he said when Petyr told her to put the 
Tears of Lys
 in her husband’s wine. He also had her write the
letter to her sister falsely naming the 
Lannisters
 as Jon Arryn’s murderers. Petyr promises never to leave her side
again, and as she falls into his arms, he tells her he has only ever loved one woman... Cat. He then shoves her out the
Moon Door. He calls for the guards, accusing Marillion of killing his wife…

Synopsis
Merrett Frey
 is approaching the ruins of 
Oldstones
 with the ransom for his half-brother's (
Stevron Frey
's) grandson
Petyr Pimple
. He is considering all the ill luck throughout his life, starting as a squire, where in a battle against the
Kingswood Brotherhood
 he got hit on the head so hard he was unable to ever truly fight again, which left him
unable to reach knighthood. 
His father
 has always mocked him as "Merrett Muttonhead", and all he was good for
during the 
Red Wedding
 was to drink the 
Greatjon
 under the table.
Merrett recollects how his father ordered the massacre of the 
Starks
 at 
Edmure Tully
’s wedding, but it was 
Lame
Lothar
 and 
Roose Bolton
 who had masterminded the whole affair. He considers how things at the 
Twins
 will turn
worse for him when his father dies, as 
Ryman
 stands to inherit, and his sons 
Edwyn
 and 
Black Walder
 after him.
Merrett feels that if he could accomplish this task, maybe his luck would change for the better, considering that
Petyr is Ser Ryman’s son. However, he has failed at everything in his life, including his role in keeping the Greatjon
too drunk to fight. The man killed or maimed four men, and it took eight to finally get him in chains.
When he reaches the site of King 
Tristifer
’s sepulcher, he finds the outlaws who captured Petyr. They surround him
and take the gold he carried for the ransom. Merrett demands to see 
Beric Dondarrion
, but 
Lem
 and 
Tom
 inform him
that the Lightning Lord was needed elsewhere. They lead him to the tree from which Petyr Pimple is hanging, and
then Lem ties a noose around Merrett’s neck. Sick with fear after they have lied about the ransom and now mean to
hang him, Merrett pleads that he had nothing to do with the Red Wedding, and that they have no witness. However,
Tom Sevenstrings steps aside to reveal a woman with grey skin and a hideous scar across her neck, 
a woman
 Merrett
knows to be dead, having seen his brothers slit her throat and dump her naked body in the river. Her eyes are terrible
to behold: they see him, and they hate him. Lem tells him that she can’t speak, but she nods when Lem asks if
Merrett was involved. Merrett opens his mouth to plead, but the noose chokes off his words.

The Prophet
The 
Prologue
 of 
A Feast for Crows
 is set in 
Oldtown
. The characters are students of the 
Citadel
 of Oldtown. The
main character
 is Pate, an unsuccessful student.
Synopsis
Pate
 sits with his fellow students, 
Mollander
, 
Alleras
, 
Armen
, and 
Roone
, at the 
Quill and Tankard
 in 
Oldtown
. He
yearns for 
Rosey
, the pretty daughter of a serving maid, a fifteen-year-old girl whose maidenhead can only be had
for a gold coin. The other students discuss 
dragons
, and whether there are still any in existence. Pate is waiting for
an 
alchemist
 who has promised to meet him there that evening. The Alchemist has offered to change iron into gold,
requesting that Pate steal a particular iron item in exchange for some gold, and said he would be back in three days
to make the exchange.
Mollander and Armen continue their argument about dragons. Mollander says that sailors' tales speak of dragons in
far places, often accompanied by a young queen. Alleras keeps splitting thrown apples with his arrows. After the
last, he brings up the 
Targaryens
, telling the others that 
Viserys Targaryen
's sister 
Daenerys
 is still alive. Mollander
drunkenly toasts her, only to be shushed by Armen.
Lazy Leo
 appears then. Mollander bristles at his appearance, Armen asking more diplomatically whether Leo wasn't
confined to the 
Citadel
 for three more days, but Leo shrugs this off with a quip on the meaninglessness of time. He
asks them to buy him a drink, since he lost his money gambling and eating elsewhere. He offends them each in turn,
then attempts to mollify them by confirming that Daenerys is alive and has hatched three dragons, as the tales come
out of 
Qarth
. 
Archmaester
 
Marwyn
 even gives them credence, Leo says. Marwyn, called "The Mage", is widely
considered unsound, partly because of his practice of speaking to smallfolk and other unwholesome people. After
the others scoff, Leo adds that there is a 
dragonglass
 candle burning in Marwyn's chambers.
The group breaks up after that, most of the students returning to the Citadel. Pate remains with Leo, hoping that the
alchemist will still come by. Leo needles Pate a few times about Rosey. Pate wishes he could kill Leo, but Leo is a
Tyrell
, with relatives in positions of power. He sees the sun rising, and realizes that the night is over and the
alchemist has not come. He leaves, with a final warning to Leo to leave Rosey alone.
Pate wanders through Oldtown in the early morning. After nearly being run down by a cart, he sees the alchemist
standing over him. He tells Pate that he didn't want to intrude on him and his friends. He has asked Pate to steal
something from Archmaester 
Walgrave
's quarters. Pate opened the box under Walgrave's bed, and found an
Archmaester's iron key which supposedly opened every lock in the Citadel; after wrestling with his conscience, he
took it, as well as a sack of silver coins.
He asks the Alchemist for his gold dragon coin, and the alchemist bids him follow him someplace more private.
They go through several winding streets and end up in an alley. The Alchemist gives Pate the coin, but the boy
hesitates before offering up the key. He asks the Alchemist's intentions, which he will not say, and asks to see his
face, which is nondescript. After giving the key to the Alchemist, he turns away, feeling light-headed, and collapses
dead on the cobblestones a few moments later.

Synopsis
Aeron Greyjoy
, who in the chapter is referred to as "the prophet", is drowning men at a beach on 
Great Wyk
. This a
practice in which a worshiper of the 
Drowned God
 is held below the water until he drowns. The priest then
resuscitates him. Through this initiation the person is stronger:
“What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.” —
Aeron Damphair
Gormond Goodbrother
 appears to bring Aeron to Lord 
Gorold Goodbrother
. Aeron initially declines but relents
when the messenger tells him 
the king
, Aeron's brother, is dead. During the journey Aeron remembers his brothers.
His father married three times. The sons of his first wife died young. The eldest son from his second marriage was
the strongest and fiercest of the remaining. Aeron admired Balon although they were not close in their youth.
When they arrive at Lord Goodbrother's hall at 
Hammerhorn
, Aeron demands that everyone in the hall be sent away
so that he and Gorold Goodbrother can speak privately. Lord Goodbrother insists that his 
maester
 will stay as well.
Aeron disagrees and prepares to leave, but the maester stops him by informing him that 
Euron Greyjoy
 has occupied
the 
Seastone Chair
. Aeron is shocked. He remembers his brother but with little love. Goodbrother wants advice on
whom to support, but Aeron wants to pray first and leaves for 
Pebbleton
.
Again Aeron thinks back to his youth. He was not a very religious man but rather a drunken sod. This changed when
he fell overboard in a sea battle during 
Balon's Rebellion
. He almost drowned and became a devoted follower of the
Drowned God. Aeron has discussed the succession with Balon. Though Balon wanted his daughter, 
Asha
, to
succeed him, Aeron did not agree with having a woman rule the 
Iron Islands
. 
Theon
 is a weakling and probably
dead. Balon's eldest brother, 
Euron
, is ungodly and Aeron hates him. Thus Aeron makes up his mind; it must be
Victarion
.
A few days later, Aeron has arrived at 
Pebbleton
 and starts to preach. Asha has also claimed the throne. Now
Aeron's followers and a number of lords look to him for advice on whom to support. During his preaching, he finds
his inspiration: the Ironmen should elect the king in a 
Kingsmoot
 as they did in the old days. Every captain is to go
to 
Nagga's Hill
 on 
Old Wyk
, the ancient place where the old kings were chosen. Aeron hears his followers take up
his call and knows he has done the right thing.

Synopsis
Prince 
Doran
 has been at the 
Water Gardens
 for nearly two years now, watching the children play in the pools while
trying to deal with his gout. Captain 
Areo Hotah
 hears the approach of 
Obara Sand
, eldest of the 
Red Viper
's 
bastard
daughters
, and bars her from disturbing Prince Doran's rest. Deadly as she may be, she is no match for the Captain,
but the Prince calls her into his presence before they come to blows. Obara demands justice for her father, imploring
Prince Doran to marshal the Dornish army and give half to her so she might march on 
Oldtown
 and burn it to the
ground, and the other half to her half-sister Lady 
Nym
 to march up the Kingsroad. Doran tells her that his brother
was not murdered, but died in single combat, and that Lord 
Tywin
 has promised them Ser 
Gregor
's head.
Unappeased, Obara mocks her uncle for his meekness and stalks off after he tells her to await his word in 
Sunspear
.
Fearing an uprising in Sunspear incited by the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran tells Hotah that he must return to his seat
at the Palace of the Sun. The Captain reminds him that Princess Myrcella is there, and that Ser 
Arys Oakheart
 sends
letters to Queen 
Cersei
. Hotah thinks that he and the 
Kingsguard
 will eventually cross swords, and when that occurs
the Captain will kill him.
The next morning, the prince and his retinue begin the journey back to Sunspear, but along the way they come upon
another of the Sand Snakes. The beautiful 
Lady Nym
 is far more tactful than her older half-sister, but no less
resolved to seek vengeance for her father. Scoffing at Obara's demand to go to war, Lady Nym tells her uncle that
she needs only her sister 
Tyene
, and the two will assassinate Cersei, 
Jaime
, Lord Tywin and King 
Tommen
. Stating
that his brother was only to take the measure of 
Joffrey
's court and not seek revenge for 
Elia
 despite the seventeen
years that have passed, Nymeria responds in parting, "My sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our
vengeance."
Arriving in 
Sunspear
, the prince's retinue is accosted by townspeople calling for vengeance for the Red Viper. In the
Old Palace
, Princess 
Arianne
 greets her father and tells him that Tyene Sand awaits him in the throne room. The
third of the Sand Snakes is embroidering when the captain encounters her while bearing Prince Doran to his high
seat. Tyene offers her uncle the cloth she is knitting, which shows her father mounted on a sand steed, so that he will
not forget the Red Viper. Prince Doran responds, "I am not like to forget your father." Tyene counsels her uncle to
wed his son 
Trystane
 to 
Myrcella
 now, and then crown the princess as is the 
Dornish
 way. This would incite the
Queen Regent and 
Highgarden
 to march on Dorne, where the prince's armies could bleed them in the high passes
and treacherous deserts. When she calls her uncle fearful, Doran advises her, "There is a difference between fear and
caution." Tyene raises her hand to touch her uncle, but Hotah brings the butt of his longaxe down on the marble
floor, and cautions her, "My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you." The Sand Snake replies that she
meant no harm and loves her uncle, he loved his brother. After she takes her leave, Maester 
Caleotte
 rushes to the
Prince's side to make sure he was not pricked by one of Tyene's needles.
Shortly after, Prince Doran commands the captain to round up and confine all the Sand Snakes, including 
Ellaria's
young daughters. Obara, Nymeria and Tyene are locked up in cells at the top of the Spear Tower, but with no blood
spilled, the younger Sand Snakes are restricted together with their mother to the Water Gardens. When Hotah tells
him that the common folk will howl when they find out, the 
Prince of Dorne
 replies, "All Dorne will howl. I only
pray Lord 
Tywin
 hears them...so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear."

Cersei II
Cersei
 has a nightmare that features 
Tyrion
 mocking her. She is woken to be informed of Lord 
Tywin
's murder. She
gives order to make sure that Tyrion is safely in his cell and reflects on who could be behind the murder, settling for
Stannis
 and the 
Tyrells
 as suspects. In a rush of desire for her brother, Cersei asks 
Jaime
 to take the position of
Hand
, but is rejected and settles for Ser 
Kevan
. Information arrives that Tyrion has escaped.
Synopsis
Cersei
 dreams that she rules from the 
Iron Throne
 and courtiers are paying her tribute. But the pleasant dream turns
into a nightmare when 
Tyrion
 appears and ridicules her, making the great lords, proud ladies and young knights
snigger at her as well. She notices she is naked and tries to cover up. Hasty moves make her wound herself on the
spikes and blades of the Iron Throne and soon she is engulfed in a mortal combat with the throne that is trying to rip
the flesh off her.
She is woken up by her frightened maid 
Senelle
, accompanied by armed men who have arrived to deliver the news
of Lord 
Tywin's
 murder. Cersei is still drowsy and believes this to be part of her nightmare. For a moment, she
mistakes the 
Kingsguard
 knight who has been sent by the 
Lord Commander
 for 
Jaime
 himself and expects Tyrion to
crawl from under her bed to laugh at her, although she knows that he is safely in his 
black cell
 and his execution will
take place the same day. She drank too much wine last night, she thinks. She now recognizes 
Jocelyn Swyft
, Ser
Osmund Kettleblack
 and Ser 
Boros Blount
 and notices 
Lannister
 guards, while she is being handed lemon water to
waken her up. She wonders whether the news can be true, insisting that her father is surrounded by guards day and
night. Ser Osmund tells her the guards were on their post, but a secret passage has been found behind a hearth in the
Hand's Tower
 and Jaime has gone in to inspect it. Cersei is worried about Jaime's safety as well as of 
Tommen
's, but
she is told that guards supervised by Ser 
Loras Tyrell
 have been assigned to watch over the King. This stirs up her
resentment against the 
Tyrells
 and she wonders whether the murder was their doing, yet does not dare to speak this
aloud. She commands Ser Osmund to escort her to the Tower of the Hand and Ser Boros to make certain that Tyrion
is still in his cell. She doesn't believe Tyrion would dare to raise a hand against their father, but needs to be certain.
Outside, the sun is beginning to rise while the stars can still be seen, making Cersei think that the great star of the
west has fallen. Ser Osmund tells her that 
Lum
, one of the guards, found the body in the privy. She already feels the
hole left by Lord Tywin and decides to act swiftly as she suspects there will be attempts to push her aside, as always.
She wonders whether 
Stannis Baratheon
 is behind the murder. She enters the tower, thinking that not crying makes
her the only true son her father ever had. Climbing the many stairs to the Hand's chambers prompts her to think
about tearing the tower down. As she enters the hall, she finds the room full of guards and servants, whispering
among themselves. Cersei resents their presence as well as the fact that she was not called first. She orders Ser
Meryn Trant
 to show the people out and is informed that her father's body has been brought to his bed. When she
enters the bedchamber, guards are present again as well as her distraught uncle 
Kevan
, kneeling by the bed and
trying to pray for his brother. She notices how small the door to the secret passage behind the hearth is, making her
think of Tyrion again, then settling for Stannis or the Tyrells as more likely suspects. She knows about the rumors of
secret passages in the 
Red Keep
 and that 
Maegor the Cruel
 supposedly killed the builders of the castle to keep them
secret. She thinks of other, yet undiscovered, secret passages to other bedchambers and has a vision of Tyrion using
one to get to Tommen.
Cersei has a look at her father's half-naked body. While reflecting on how he looks much older and smaller than
when he was alive, she already notices a smell emanating from the corpse. She is furious that the quarrel that killed

Lord Tywin has been left in his stomach and orders it to be removed. Cersei wonders whether she should act
desperate and claw her own face, as she heard 
Catelyn Stark
 did when her son 
Robb
 was killed before her eyes, and
wonders how Lord Tywin once received news of his 
own father's
 death. She commands that the bells must toll for
her father just as they did for 
King Robert
. She asks for 
Pycelle
 and wants him to prepare the body, but is told that
the 
Grand Maester
 has already been there and left again. This angers her more because of Pycelle's uselessness in
old age and she calls for Maesters 
Ballabar
 and 
Frenken
 instead. Cersei asks about Jaime and is again told he's down
in the secret passage, inspecting the depth of a shaft found there. She is worried about his safety, thinking of his lost
hand and how the murderer might await him in the dark.
Qyburn
 is shown in, offering his service as maester. He informs her that he treated Jaime's hand and she remembers
that he came down from 
Harrenhal
 with her brother. She notices that he doesn't have a maester's chain, receiving the
answer that it has been taken away by the 
Citadel
 while his knowledge is still there. She orders him to remove the
quarrel and prepare her father's body for the silent sisters. Qyburn asks her what he should do with the girl. Cersei
has not noticed the second body in the bed before and takes a look at her naked body, observing the golden chain
around her neck and that her face is as black as 
Joffrey's
 was when he died. She is furious and demands to know
what the girl is doing there, receiving the unsatisfying answer that she has been found where she is and that she was
Tyrion's whore. She thinks that Lord Tywin never used whores and defensively tells a guard how he treated his own
father's mistress after his death, parading her naked through the streets of 
Lannisport
. Qyburn suggests that Lord
Tywin might have been questioning the girl about her mistress 
Sansa Stark
's disappearance. Cersei eagerly seizes on
this notion but has a vision of Tyrion mocking it. She can't stand staying in the room with the girl any longer and
goes back to the hall.
She finds Ser Osmund accompanied by his brothers 
Osney
 and 
Osfryd
 and orders them to make certain that nobody
will ever hear about the dead girl in her father's bed. Her body is to be disposed of no matter how and everyone who
talks about this matter will have their tongues torn out. She watches as the Kettleblacks put the girl's body in a
blanket, remembering that the girl's name was 
Shae
 and that she came to her the night before Tyrion's trial by
combat, asking that promises made to her by Tyrion and, allegedly, Cersei be kept, including a manse in the city and
a knight to marry. Cersei made it clear that she would get nothing until she told them the whereabouts of Sansa
Stark, making her leave in tears. She orders the Kettleblacks to carry Shae's body out through the secret passage, but
wants to have the chain around her neck delivered to herself.
As Ser Osfryd is about to step into the tunnel, Jaime emerges from it. She rushes towards him, asking whether he
has found the killers, but is told that the shaft ends in a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet, some of them
closed with locked iron gates, and Jaime needs to find keys first. He suggests that the killers could still be hiding in
the maze he just left. Cersei again envisions Tyrion climbing through the walls like some monstrous rat, then
reassures herself with the thought that he is in his cell. She says she wants the murderers to be found and that the
whole tower will be demolished if need be. Jaime hugs her to console her and she has a rush of desire for him. She
whispers in his ear, asking him to take over as 
Hand of the King
 to complete their father's work. But he pushes her
away, declines the offer, makes a joke about a Hand without a hand and says that she shouldn't ask him to rule.
Cersei feels the rejection like a slap, realizing that it has been noticed by everyone present and that the whole castle
will know soon. She angrily says that she didn't ask him to rule, as she is going to do that herself as the Queen
Regent until Tommen comes of age. Jaime replies that he doesn't know whom to feel worse for, Tommen or the
Seven Kingdoms
. She slaps him. They are both admonished by Ser Kevan to take their indecent behavior out of the
room where their father's body lies. Jaime apologizes for his sister, pointing out that she is forgetting herself while
grief-stricken. This makes Cersei want to slap him again and regret her impulse to ask him. She wonders whether the
position of Hand should be abolished altogether, remembering how 
Jon Arryn
 and 
Eddard Stark
 meddled in her
affairs, the latter forcing her to get rid of King Robert before she could deal with his brothers, and how Tyrion sold
Myrcella
 to 
Dorne
, made Tommen a hostage and killed Joffrey.
Cersei settles on her uncle Kevan as the next Hand, as she considers him loyal and prudent while unambitious to
challenge her as the real power behind the Iron Throne. She thinks that she needs men supporting her and that the
current 
small council
 will not do, with Grand Maester Pycelle too old and Lord 
Mace Tyrell
 and his bannermen
Lord 
Paxter Redwyne
 and Lord 
Mathis Rowan
 not to be trusted; she also can't rely on Jaime, who has lost his
courage with his hand. She again considers the possibility of the Tyrells being involved in the murder, as Lord Mace
must have known he can never rule the Seven Kingdoms as long as Tywin Lannister is alive. However, she realizes
she has to proceed carefully against the Tyrells, with the city full of their men and 
Loras Tyrell
 now knight of the

Kingsguard. The thought of the engagement of Tommen and 
Margaery Tyrell
 still makes her furious and she
questions Margaery's virginity. Cersei intends to use 
Varys
 to find out more on this front.
The thought of Varys makes Cersei aware that the eunuch isn't present, while he is usually around when something
important happens in the Red Keep. The only explanation for his absence is that he was involved in the plot,
preempting his own downfall as Lord Tywin never had any love for him. She thinks that Varys might have known
about the secret passage and acted on behalf of Stannis. She orders Ser Meryn to find the 
Master of Whisperers
 and
bring him to her.
Ser Boros returns red-faced and puffing, announcing that Tyrion is gone, his cell open, with no sign of him
anywhere. Cersei is appalled, thinking her nightmares are coming true. She points out her orders to keep the Imp
under guard day and night. Ser Boros says that a goaler called 
Rugen
 has gone missing while two others were found
asleep. She orders for them to be killed. Cersei's paranoia about Tyrion breaks out fully and reflects that he has
already killed her mother, her father and her eldest son and will try to murder her too, remembering the prophecy
she once received about her little brother killing her. She gets queasy and Ser Boros tries to sustain her, but she
recoils from his touch, thinking that the knight of the Kingsguard might be one of Tyrion's creatures, too. He offers
her a cup of water, but all she wants is Tyrion's blood. She envisions Tyrion grinning at her, feeling his hands
closing in around her neck the very moment she thought she was rid of him.

Synopsis
Brienne
 is traveling to 
Duskendale
, seeking the whereabouts of 
Sansa
 as she was charged to do by 
Jaime
. Having
found few leads in 
King's Landing
, Brienne is asking nearly everyone she can along the roads and villages, but never
mentions Sansa by name. Upon 
the road
 beyond 
Rosby
, she comes upon a camp with two hedge knights who offer
to share their meal. Mistaking her at first for a man, Ser 
Illifer
 later remarks on how she bears a shield with the sigil
of 
House Lothston
, a disgraced family who once held 
Harrenhal
. Brienne was given the shield by Ser Jaime, who
had taken it from Harrenhal. When she tells the two that she lost her own shield, Ser Illifer figures out by her size
that she must be Brienne, murderess of King 
Renly
. The Maid denies having killed Renly, and the hedge knights
agree to travel with her to Duskendale.
After passing a large group of poor fellows (or '
sparrows
'), lowly holy men bound for King's Landing bearing the
bones of septons killed around the Riverlands, they catch up to a merchant guarded by a couple of men and another
hedge knight named Ser 
Shadrich
. Joining forces along the dangerous road, Ser Shadrich tells Brienne in private that
he knows that the maid she seeks is Sansa Stark, and that he seeks her as well, but for a purse of gold offered by
Varys
. Brienne is disturbed by the fact that the knight knew whom she was speaking of when she repeated Sansa's
description to the merchant's group. When the party stops at an inn for the night, Brienne slips off on her own,
swearing to herself that she will not fail Jaime, having already failed King Renly and Lady 
Catelyn
.

The events of this chapter are later revisited in 
Chapter 7 of 
A Dance with Dragons
, but from 
Jon's
 perspective rather
than 
Samwell Tarly
's.
Synopsis
Down in the library beneath 
Castle Black
, 
Sam
 is trying to dig up any information on the 
Others
 for his Lord
Commander, 
Jon Snow
. Returning to the surface, Sam considers how hard Jon has been working the men of 
the
Watch
. He meets 
Dolorous Edd
, 
Pyp
, and 
Grenn
, and they mention how much Jon has changed, acting different and
barely spending any time with his friends; although he never misses a day practising his sword work. We learn that
Stannis
 has plans for 
Val
, 
Dalla
's sister, seeking to use her in order to forge an alliance between the 
wildlings
 and the
northmen
. Thus far only the 
Karstarks
, who have no other choice, have agreed to ally with Stannis.
Sam arrives at Jon's solar, and Jon shows him a letter he plans to send to King 
Tommen
 which declares that Stannis
is aiding them in their battle, but the Night's Watch is not sworn to his cause. They discuss how 
Melisandre
 means to
sacrifice 
Mance Rayder
 for his king's blood, Jon states, "Mance's blood is no more royal than mine own". He reveals
to Sam that he is sending 
Gilly
 and "the boy" far away from the Wall. Sam tells Jon that he has uncovered little on
the Others, but one book mentioned 
dragonsteel
 swords as being effective against them. However, neither is sure if
dragonsteel and 
Valyrian steel
 are the same thing.
Jon breaks the news that he is sending Sam to the 
Citadel
 so he can train to become a 
maester
 and replace 
Aemon
.
Sam will travel by sea from 
Eastwatch
, along with Gilly, the baby, and Maester Aemon. The thought of becoming a
maester frightens Sam, bringing back memories of 
his father
's wrath when he had mentioned training at the Citadel
to him when he was a boy. His father had chained him by the neck in a cell and left him there for 3 days, telling him
"no son of 
House Tarly
 will ever wear a chain". Lastly, Jon commands Sam to never call himself craven again.
The next morning, as the party prepares to set off for Eastwatch where they will join up with 
Dareon
, Gilly begs Jon
to find a good 
wetnurse
 for the other baby.

Arya II
Synopsis
Nearing 
Braavos
, 
Arya
 recalls how she originally wanted Captain 
Ternesio Terys
 to sail for 
the Wall
. She had no
such luck, but concluded that the 
Free Cities
 would be a good place to land, considering that 
Syrio Forel
 came from
Braavos and possibly 
Jaqen H'ghar
 as well.
During the voyage, many of the sailors and even the captain have tried to get her to learn and remember their names,
and many seem afraid of her. The captain's younger son 
Denyo
 is telling Arya some of the history of Braavos and
the Titan that guards its port. The free city honors all gods and even has temples devoted to them, and was founded
by the 
Moonsingers
 when they brought the people to Braavos to escape the dragons of 
Valyria
. The 
Titan of
Braavos
 is a massive statue, and has arrow slits and murder holes strategically placed to attack any boat that tries to
pass beneath without leave. Furthermore, the Free City of Braavos is protected by the 
Arsenal
, a massive fleet of
ships and their fortified port.
The captain has his older son 
Yorko
 row Arya to shore, so as to get her off prior to customs coming aboard. As
Yorko navigates the hundred isles of Braavos, he points out many of the sites, before dropping her off at the quay in
front of the 
House of Black and White
. Arya disembarks, assuring Yorko that she will remember his name, and
enters the temple of the 
Many-Faced God
. Within, the temple is quite dark with dozens of odd statues, and Arya
notices several people in alcoves who are either dead or dying. Soon, a robed man with a kind voice tells her that the
House of Black and White is a place of peace. He asks her name, but despite Arya's use of nicknames, the man
keeps asking until she admits that she is Arya Stark. When the man asks if she fears death, Arya answers no. The
man removes his cowl to reveal a decaying, horrible visage, but she sees through the illusion. Impressed, the 
kindly
man
 asks if she is hungry, to which Arya thinks: 
Yes, but not for food.

Cersei III
Synopsis
Cersei arrives at the 
Great Sept of Baelor
 for 
Tywin
's wake. She worries. 
Tommen
 seems to have a cold and the
current 
High Septon
 was appointed by 
Tyrion
. She wonders if she should have him removed. Tommen and Cersei
both notice the stench that is emanating from her father's corpse.
After the service, the procession of mourners come to offer condolences to Cersei. First is 
Falyse Stokeworth
, who
mentions that 
her sister
 is ready to give birth and the family would like to name the child Tywin. Cersei is offended
and brusquely forbids her. Next is 
Lancel
 who is still looking half dead. As he begins to mention his love and then
his new-found faith, Cersei heads him off by saying, "Atonement is best achieved through prayer. Silent prayer."
The only mourner to please Cersei is 
Taena Merryweather
, who promises that all her friends in the 
Free Cities
 have
been notified to watch for and seize Tyrion.
When 
Mace Tyrell
 comes before her, he mentions that his uncle 
Garth
 is on the way to assume the duties of 
Master
of Coin
. The Queen Regent, not wishing to see another Tyrell on the small council, immediately backpedals that
Gyles Rosby
 has already accepted the post. This upsets Tyrell and 
his mother
, as Tywin had wanted Garth to assume
the position. The Queen of Thorns then brings up the terrible smell in the sept, and Cersei wants nothing more than
to get rid of the clever old woman. But Lady Olenna states she will not depart until 
Margaery
 is wed to Tommen.
Leaving the Sept, Cersei rides back to the 
Red Keep
 with 
Gyles Rosby
, asking him belatedly to be her new master of
coin, which he accepts.
Back in her rooms, 
Qyburn
 pays her a visit, revealing that he discovered in the undergaoler's sleeping cell a gold
coin that dated back to the 
Gardener
 Kings of the Reach. Once again, Cersei is suspicious that the 
Tyrells
 had a hand
in Tyrion's escape and Tywin's murder. Qyburn then asks if he may experiment on the dying 
Gregor Clegane
 in the
black cells
, since he is more adept at the nature of death than any of the 
archmaesters
 from the 
Citadel
. She agrees
with his request, but tells him to bring her Gregor's head when he dies, as her father had promised it to 
Dorne
.
Finally, 
Kevan
 meets with her for dinner, as she had requested.
Cersei asks him to be Tommen's 
Hand
. Kevan first admonishes her for making Mace Tyrell look a fool in front of
half the court. He then informs her that he would rather help his son Lancel take control of Castle 
Darry
. He offers
to take up the position as Hand, provided Cersei removes herself from 
King's Landing
 and returns to 
Casterly Rock
.
Cersei is infuriated and a fierce argument takes place during which she threatens Kevan. Unfazed, Kevan counsels
her to name 
Randyll Tarly
 or 
Mathis Rowan
 as Tommen's Hand. As both men are Tyrell vassals, this makes Cersei
even more angry and she accuses him of abandoning Tommen. As he departs, Kevan reveals that he knows who
Tommen's father really is.

Jaime II
Synopsis
Standing a planned seven day vigil over 
his father
's funeral bier, 
Jaime
 finds himself with a lot of time for thinking.
He feels that he is as much to blame for his father's death as 
Tyrion
 or 
Varys
. He also finds himself wondering what
happened to the eunuch. His thoughts then turn to the day that Prince 
Rhaegar
 rode for the 
Trident
. Jaime had
begged not to be left behind to guard the king, but Rhaegar told him that 
Aerys
 feared Lord Tywin more than he did
Robert
, and meant to keep Jaime at his side as insurance. Mounting up, Rhaegar's last words to Jaime were, "When
this battle's done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but...well, it does no
good to speak of roads not taken." Finally, Jaime recalls his recent questioning of the 
chief undergaoler
, which was a
complete farce as Jaime knew far more than the man did, since he was the perpetrator.
When Jaime learned that the two gaolers who were put to sleep were killed by 
Boros Blount
 and 
Osmund
Kettleblack
, he reprimanded them, warning them never to act on 
his sister
's orders to kill anyone without consulting
him first. Some time in the middle of the night, Cersei visits him with news of 
Kevan
's refusal to become her 
Hand
,
as well as remarking that Kevan knows about their relationship. She implores Jaime to reconsider being Hand, but
Jaime rejects her again. She departs with, "Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you." The
next morning, the mourners arrive anew, but the smell is so nauseating that 
Tommen
 gets sick. Jaime takes him
outside to console him, advising him to "go away inside", something Tommen understands from when 
Joffrey
 would
torment him. Cersei then joins them, as does 
Mace Tyrell
, and Jaime asks the Lord of 
Highgarden
 to have dinner
with his sister. When Mace departs, Jaime tells Cersei to get the wedding over with, and then send Lord Mace to
besiege 
Storm's End
 once again. Cersei likes the idea, hoping Tyrell might lose his life this time.

Synopsis
When 
Brienne
 reaches 
Duskendale
, she finds the gates barred for the night. The area surrounding it is littered with
corpses of both northmen and men from 
the Reach
.
The gates open at morning, and the captain tells Brienne that his sister can paint over the black bat of 
Lothston
 on
her shield. After finding and telling the sister what sigil she wants, Brienne heads to the 
Dun Fort
 to speak to the
lord. Since Lord 
Rykker
 is in the field, she meets with the castellan Ser 
Rufus Leek
 and a maester, who tells her that
many came before her asking if 
Dontos Hollard
 and 
Sansa
 had come to Duskendale. The Dun Fort's maester tells the
story of the 
Defiance of Duskendale
, which seems to have been the incident that finally sent 
King Aerys
 over the
edge.
Either of his own initiative, or from the urgings of 
his wife
, 
Denys Darklyn
 took Aerys hostage. When 
Tywin
Lannister
 (who was 
Hand
 at the time) surrounded the Dun Fort, Lord Darklyn threatened to kill Aerys. When Aerys
was captured, 
Symon Hollard
 killed one of his kingsguard, Ser 
Gwayne Gaunt
.
After 
Barristan the Bold
 slipped into the Dun Fort and rescued the king, Aerys had nearly every member of the
Darklyn
 and 
Hollard
 families killed or attainted. 
Dontos
, who was young at the time, survived because Barristan
asked Aerys to stay his hand.
The castellan tells Brienne that Duskendale would have been the last place Dontos would have fled to. Despairing
that she will never find Sansa, Brienne bumps into a skinny boy whom she also saw back at 
Rosby
 on a 
piebald
rounsey
, but he runs away.
Visiting the 
Seven Swords
 inn for dinner, Brienne meets a 
pious dwarf
, who tells her that he overheard a man called
Nimble 
Dick
 in 
Maidenpool
 bragging that he had 
"fooled a 
fool
"
 seeking passage for three across the 
Narrow Sea
.
That night, Brienne dreams of 
Renly
's death, but when he topples after the shadow killed him, the body is that of
Jaime
.
The next day, Brienne picks up her shield, painted with the sigil that 
Tanselle
 had painted for Ser 
Duncan the Tall
.
Proceeding to Maidenpool, Brienne camps by the ruins of the Hollard castle, and hears a rider. Fearing it may be Ser
Shadrich
 and that a battle might ensue, she discovers the boy who seems to be stalking her. It turns out to be 
Podrick
Payne
, who asks to stay with her, hoping that if she finds Sansa, it may lead the boy back to 
Tyrion
.

Synopsis
Marillion
 is singing day and night. Because 
his cell
 is open, his songs can be heard throughout the castle. Although
Marillion has a beautiful voice, 
Sansa
 does not like the sound of his singing. She asks 
Petyr
 if he cannot silence the
singer. Littlefinger explains to Sansa that they need Marillion. With some persuasion, Marillion has confessed to the
murder of 
Lysa
. In return for his confession, Littlefinger has spared his life and his voice. Petyr tells Sansa that she
has to corroborate Marillion's confession. Sansa knows that Marillion did not murder Lysa and therefore hesitates.
She has no pity for the singer as he has tried to rape her, but she is afraid that people will see through her lies.
The next day 
Nestor Royce
 and 
his son
 arrive at the Eyrie to investigate the murder of Lysa Arryn. Although she is
afraid, Sansa tells the Royces that Marillion killed Lysa Arryn. Her fright and tears only make her more convincing.
Then Marillion is led in. He confesses that he killed his mistress because he could not bear the thought of seeing her
married to Petyr. The Royces never liked Marillion and don’t question his confession. They agree that Marillion will
be confined to the sky cells. Eventually he will fall or jump to his death.
Nestor then informs Petyr that 
his cousin
 is gathering other lords to have Petyr removed as Lord Protector of the
Vale. Littlefinger already knows this and is unfazed. As a reward for his services, he presents Nestor with a grant
that makes him and his descendents hereditary Lords of the 
Gates of the Moon
. The Gates of the Moon are a
secondary castle that has always been in the possession of the 
main Arryn line
. Nestor has been appointed castellan
but now acquires the castle in his own right. According to Petyr, Lysa had already decided to give the castle to
Nestor but was murdered before she could sign the order. When Nestor Royce and his son leave, Littlefinger
explains to Sansa that the Royces will now be on his side. If Petyr is removed as Lord Protector, the grant for the
castle will be challenged because it was signed by Petyr and not by little 
Robert
.
That night when Sansa goes to sleep, Robert creeps into her bed as he has been doing since his mother died. He asks
Sansa if she is his mother now. Sansa says yes because she knows this lie will soothe him.

Synopsis
Asha
 is at 
Ten Towers
 waiting for her supporters to arrive. The feast is almost over. There are a lot of 
Harlaws
 in the
hall but not enough of the other houses. Asha knows she lacks support.
She tells 
Three-Tooth
 to find food for her crew and her prisoners. Then she goes to her uncle 
Rodrik Harlaw
, the
lord of Harlaw. She finds him in the 
Book Tower
, reading. Rodrik Harlaw loves his books. It is this love that earned
him the nickname "The Reader". In Asha's name, Rodrik has sent summons to the captains to gather at Ten Towers.
The captains of 
Harlaw
 isle have come but very few others. Rodrik informs Asha that 
Aeron Greyjoy
 has called for
a 
kingsmoot
, an assembly of all captains to choose the king. Rodrik assures Asha that her cause is hopeless, since no
woman has ever ruled the 
ironborn
. Even the support of Rodrik does not mean his vassals will support her. Their
fealty is for war purposes only. In a kingsmoot they are allowed to vote as they please. Rodrik councils Asha to stay
away from the kingsmoot. Besides her lack of support, he is afraid that 
Euron Greyjoy
 will kill his competitors.
Rodrik offers to give her Ten Towers instead. His heir 
Harras Harlaw
 does not need Ten Towers and will protect
her. Asha declines the offer and walks back to the hall.
She encounters 
Tristifer Botley
 on the way. When they were young, Tristifer was in love with Asha. Asha liked him
in the beginning but became bored with him before he was sent away. Tristifer, though, has never forgotten her and
wants to wed Asha. He is the legitimate Lord of 
House Botley
. His 
father
 has been killed by Euron Greyjoy for
refuting Euron's claim to the throne. His titles have been given to Tristifer's uncle who supported Euron. Asha
sharply refuses Tristifer's advances by reminding him that they are not children anymore and that she is his queen,
not his wife.
Easter egg
: In the chapter Rodrik Harlaw mentions an Archmaester named 
Rigney
 who believes that history is a
wheel. 
The Wheel of Time
 fantasy series author Robert Jordan's real name is James Rigney.

Cersei IV
Synopsis
Cersei
 is remembering her concession to the 
Queen of Thorns
 to allow 
Tommen
 and 
Margaery
 to sleep in the same
bed on their wedding night only, when 
Jaime
 arrives to speak to her. He asks if she still means to burn down the
Tower of the Hand
 after the wedding, but she is determined to see it destroyed, and hopefully smoke out a few rats
in the process. We begin to notice changes in Cersei, including weight gain and overindulgence in alcohol.
Tommen's wedding is a modest affair compared to 
his brother
's, and the ceremony goes over well enough.
Afterwards, 
Kevan
 comes over to Cersei and mentions that 
Sandor Clegane
 is reported to have joined 
Beric
Dondarrion
's 
outlaws
. The queen is already aware of this, having heard that outlaws have pillaged 
Saltpans
 and
savagely raped the townswomen. The report mentioned that they were led by a huge man in a hound's head helmet.
Cersei suggests that 
Lancel
 hunt down the Hound, but her uncle scoffs that his son is not the man to deal with
Clegane. When she then suggests that he go after Clegane himself, Ser Kevan responds, "When a dog goes bad, the
fault lies with its master." Talking to Jaime, she wonders if Margaery is really a maiden, and he tells her that 
Mace
Tyrell
 will be marching on 
Storm's End
 in a few days, while 
Garlan Tyrell
 will take half the Tyrell host to
Brightwater Keep
 and then on to 
Highgarden
, including Lady 
Alerie Tyrell
 and Lady Olenna. During the reception,
Cersei recalls her visit to a 
woods witch
 when she was younger, and the old hag's words: Queen you shall be, until
there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear. Drinking heavily
during the feast, she begins to wonder if Margaery is the one in the hag's prophecy, which also mentions the
valonqar
.
When Tommen chokes on his wine accidentally, Cersei flees the hall for some air. She is met outside by Lady
Taena
, who informs her that one of Cersei's maids is a spy reporting to Margaery's cousins. Cersei assumes it is
Senelle
, and promises to reward Lady Merryweather if this is true. Asking why the beauty from Myr would venture
this info, Taena responds that she wants what is best for her 
husband
 and 
son
, and Cersei could provide
advancement for 
her family
. Back inside, Cersei refuses to dance with anyone, but takes note of how attractive the
Bastard of Driftmark, 
Aurane Waters
, is: with his silvery hair - a mark of 
house Velaryon
 which is descended from
the Freehold of 
Valyria
 like 
the Targaryens
 - he almost resembles 
Prince Rhaegar
.
Towards the end of the night, Cersei leads everyone outside to watch as the pyromancers set the Tower of the Hand
on fire. As the green flames of wildfire consume the Tower, the queen regent compares the beauty of the spectacle to
Joffrey. As the others begin to depart for bed, Cersei remains behind to watch the fires burn, arm in arm with Ser
Osmund Kettleblack
.

Brienne III
Synopsis
Slipping through the shadow city of 
Sunspear
 during the night for a rendezvous with Princess 
Arianne
, Ser 
Arys
Oakheart
 considers how unlikely it is for an 
Oakheart
 to even be in 
Dorne
. Hailing from 
the Reach
, the Oakhearts
have long been enemies of the Dornish. The kingsguard knight left 
Myrcella
 playing 
cyvasse
 with Prince 
Trystane
,
and under the protection of the prince's 
sworn shield
 Ser 
Gascoyne
. Arys recalls his recent first meeting with Prince
Doran
, who advised him that Myrcella would be safer at the 
Water Gardens
. All her guards and Ser Arys would
accompany them there, but Doran asked him not to write 
King's Landing
 about the move. When he arrives at
Arianne's secret location, he swears he will do no more than tell her it has to end, but her nakedness overwhelms
him.
After their passion is sated, Arys is once again consumed by guilt, but Arianne has a response for every one of his
doubts. The knight feels he has dishonored himself enough already, and he doesn't want to dishonor her. But
Arianne's seductive words and gestures are difficult for him to disregard. When Arianne reminds him that he told her
he loved her, Arys responds that he has sworn a vow. However, Arianne brings up several Kingsguard who broke
their vows, most famously 
Lucamore the Lusty
 and 
Terrence Toyne
, and even Prince 
Aemon the Dragonknight
(though Ser Arys doesn't believe the latter story). She finishes with, "It is not our love that dishonored you, it is the
monsters you have served and the brutes you've called your brothers." When Arys tells her that King 
Robert
 was no
monster, he can't help but think that she is right about 
Joffrey
. Although he considers 
Tommen
 to be Joffrey's
opposite, he can't disagree with Arianne's persuasive words that Myrcella would be a better ruler.
Their conversation moves to 
Criston Cole
, Lord Commander of 
Viserys I
's Kingsguard. At the time of Viserys'
death, Ser Cole convinced Viserys' son Aegon II to claim the rule of the Seven Kingdoms. This led to the war
between Aegon and his elder sister Rhaenyra, whom Viserys had long groomed as his succession.
Arianne reminds Arys that in Dorne, the eldest child rules, and had it not been for Criston the Kingmaker, even the
Targaryen inheritance might have been rewritten. She then explains to him the real reason that Myrcella is being
moved to the Water Gardens: "To keep her away from those who'd seek to crown her." Arys tells her that the Water
Gardens are not a prison, but she warns him that 
Hotah
 will see that Myrcella does not leave, claiming he is terrible
when aroused.
Still unable to convince Arys that her suggestions are correct, Arianne hugs him and begins to tremble. Once again,
she manipulates him by asserting that if the 
Sand Snakes
 can be imprisoned by her father for wanting to crown
Myrcella, she could too. She mentions that there are no secrets between 
Tyene
 and herself, and then tells him her
father has never considered her worthy. Prince Doran tried several times to marry her off to old men of high birth,
and when she was 14 she discovered a letter her father had written to her brother 
Quentyn
, a ward of 
Lord Anders
Yronwood
 for years. In the letter, Doran wrote, "one day you will sit where I sit and rule all of Dorne, and a ruler
must be strong of mind and body."
Ser Arys argues that this couldn't be true, but when she asks him where Prince Quentyn is now and his response is
with Lord Anders Yronwood in the 
Boneway
, Arianne tells him that is what her father wants everyone to believe.
She has gotten word from some of her friends that Quentyn is across the 
Narrow Sea
, and she is sure that he is hiring
the 
Golden Company
, who recently broke their contract with 
Myr
. The Golden Company has never broken their
word since 
Bittersteel
 reformed them nearly a hundred years ago, and since most of their members are exiles, the
only reason they would change allegiance would be to return home to 
Westeros
. And Anders' ancestors fought in
three of the 
Blackfyre Rebellions
, a fact that convinces Arianne that he seeks to crown Quentyn as the next Prince of

Dorne.
Arianne's final persuasive words are, "So your two princesses share a common cause, ser... and they share as well a
knight who claims to love them both, but will not fight for them." Ser Arys then swears to defend Myrcella's right to
rule, and to protect Arianne from anyone seeking to steal her birthright. When he asks her what she would have of
him, Arianne purrs, "All. All my love, my sweet love, and forever. But first...Myrcella."

Brienne IV
Synopsis
Drawing near 
Maidenpool
, 
Pod Payne
 can't seem to remember if 
Brienne
 is a knight or a lady, frequently calling her
"My Lady. Ser." Brienne has taken up his training, abandoned since 
Aron Santagar
 was killed by the mob in 
King's
Landing
. They soon come upon a farmer, his wife and their cart of eggs bound for Maidenpool. As they ride
together, the farmer tells Brienne that the town has been mostly rebuilt, thanks to the hard hand of 
Randyll Tarly
.
The Maid of Tarth hopes she can slip through town without encountering the Lord of 
Horn Hill
, as she owes him a
debt but bears no liking for the man. At the gates of Maidenpool, the captain informs the farmer that he will take his
eggs and wife, forcing Brienne to draw her sword. Outnumbered by the gate guards, she is spared fighting by the
appearance of 
Hyle Hunt
, a knight highly placed in Lord Tarly's army and a man whom Brienne despises.
Hunt begins to mock her and Brienne warns him that she will sort him out in a melee some day, just as she did Red
Ronnet Connington
 during the melee at 
Ashford
. She asks him the location of the 
Stinking Goose
, but Ser Hyle
takes her to see Lord Randyll first. The commander of 
Mace Tyrell
's vanguard is dispensing his harsh brand of
justice when they come upon him. When she is brought before him, Lord Tarly asks her if she killed 
Renly
, and then
states he should ship her back to 
Tarth
. But Brienne reveals the King's document that 
Jaime
 has given her, and she
informs Tarly that she is seeking Sansa. He responds that Sansa is not in Maidenpool, nor would she be in 
the Vale
,
as Brienne has also assumed, since 
Lysa Arryn
 is dead.
Brienne is shocked to learn that Sansa's aunt is dead. She heads off to the tavern, sending Ser Hyle off when he
attempts to apologize for his actions at 
Highgarden
. Later, awaiting the arrival of 
Nimble Dick
 at the Stinking
Goose, she recalls the hurtful game Hyle and his friends played at her expense. Brienne had gone to Highgarden to
answer Renly Baratheon's call to banners, expecting to be ridiculed. But unbelievably, many of the young knights
she met (
Big Ben Bushy
, 
Edmund Ambrose
, 
Hyle Hunt
, 
Red Ronnet Connington
, 
Hugh Beesbury
, 
Richard Farrow
,
Owen Inchfield
, and 
Mark Mullendore
) were exceedingly kind to her, going above and beyond the others to win her
favor. Wary of their intentions, Brienne was still vulnerable thanks to hope, but she soon learned the truth. Randyll
Tarly called her before him to reveal what he had learned of their game through his son 
Dickon
. The knights
involved had a burgeoning wager on who could claim her maidenhead. Tarly ended their game, but told her the fault
lay with herself, claiming her being here encouraged them and that a war host is no place for a maiden.
When Dick Crabb finally arrives, Brienne offers to buy him drinks. Nimble Dick soon launches into his story, egged
on by a steady bribe from Brienne. He explains how he offered to help a frightened fool make it across the 
Narrow
Sea
. The fool claimed he had two girls with him, but couldn't chance the ports in Maidenpool. So Dick took his coin
and took him and the girls along the shore to an old, now-unused smuggler's cove, up past 
Crackclaw Point
. Nimble
Dick agrees to take her there for a large sum of coin, pointing out that he is from the area, and warns Brienne of the
Whispers
, a keep built by a mythical ancestor of his, Ser 
Clarence Crabb
.

 ship 
Blackbird

Horn Hill
, Maester 
Aemon
 back at the 
Citadel

Dareon
 in his new role as a

Synopsis
An honor procession flanks Lord 
Tywin
's casket as it heads west, led by many of the Lannister bannermen. 
Jaime
falls in with his uncle 
Kevan
, and they discuss the attack on 
Saltpans
. Jaime cautions his uncle not to try and take on
Sandor Clegane
 or 
Beric Dondarrion
, and that he would have made a good 
Hand
. Kevan rejects him coolly, and lets
Jaime know he knows about the relationship of the twins.
As Jaime returns to 
King's Landing
, he looks upon the encamped Lannister army, which will soon board the
Redwynes'
 fleet to lay siege to 
Dragonstone
. He finds his sister in her solar as Grand Maester 
Pycelle
 delivers news
that Ser 
Bronn
 has named 
Lollys
's bastard newborn "
Tyrion
". Jaime realizes that his sister may try to have Bronn
killed for this jape, and he recalls the look on her face the night of 
Tommen
's wedding when the 
Tower of the Hand
was aflame. This called to mind the madness of King 
Aerys
 and the way he would become arosed by fire. Jaime
recalls Aerys' rape of 
his wife
 the evening he had Lord 
Chelsted
 burned alive. Jaime had the guard of the queen's
bedchamber when she was screaming for her husband to stop. When Jaime said that they were sworn to protect her
too, his partner that night, Ser 
Jonothor Darry
, replied, "We are, but not from him."
Jaime asks to speak with Cersei alone, and asks her why she keeps Lady 
Taena
 around all the time, knowing that she
is a spy for 
Margaery
. Cersei responds that Taena is more her spy, considering that the Queen Regent can do more
for the 
Merryweather family
. Jaime cautions that she doesn't truly know the woman, but Cersei remarks that she
may make 
Taena's husband
 the Hand. After Jaime asks her about the rumor that she plans to name 
Aurane Waters
her new master of ships, he recommends that she would be better off naming 
Paxter Redwyne
. But Cersei will not
put any Tyrell vassals on her small council. Cersei also defends her choice of 
Qyburn
, a disgraced and twisted
maester, to join the council. Cersei's growing paranoia and brutality are becoming more evident and Jaime retorts,
"You are seeing dwarfs in every shadow and making foes of friends. Uncle Kevan is not your enemy. 
I
 am not your
enemy." However, Cersei throws him out of her solar in fury.
In the White Sword Tower, Jaime speaks with 
Loras Tyrell
, asking him what he knows of certain famous
kingsguard. Ser Loras is well-versed, but when the Lord Commander mentions some lesser-known Kingsguard, the
Knight of Flowers does not recognize their names. Jaime points out that all of them served well, perhaps even better
than the famous knights. Loras remarks that the great Kingsguard knights will always be remembered as heroes, but
Jaime reminds him that the most infamous will also be remembered. And then there are those who are not easily
classified, of which he offers as an example 
Criston Cole
, the Kingmaker.

Synopsis
After yet another group presents her with a 
dwarf's head
 that is not 
Tyrion's
, 
Cersei
 walks together with 
Qyburn
 to
meet the small council. The new 
Master of Whisperers
 indicates that he has prepared the "skull" in an ebony box for
delivery to Prince 
Doran
, but no mention is made that it belongs to 
Gregor Clegane
.
Pycelle
 is near apoplectic upon hearing that Qyburn has been raised to Lord and has replaced 
Varys
 on the council,
and Cersei makes it clear how unfit she considers the old Grand Maester. Cersei has finalised her appointments,
placing men she considers to be meek and loyal and giving them the titles used in the 
Free Cities
, thinking that she
will have no "masters" with her in the 
small Council
. She now has a council consisting of:
The council first discusses the unrest in 
Sunspear
 and Prince Doran's letter that he imprisoned the 
Sand Snakes
.
Cersei notes that they are sending 
Balon Swann
 to Dorne with 
Gregor Clegane
's head as has been promised, but she
does not mention that Balon will have another task as well.
We also learn that 
Tyrion's High Septon
 has died in his "sleep", and the council brings up the continuing influx of
"sparrows" into 
King's Landing
, stirring up the populace with their preaching of "doom and demon worship". But
Cersei cares not, nor does she care who becomes 
High Septon
, provided he "pronounce(s) an anathema upon the
Imp."
The next topic is a letter by the 
Lords Declarant
 in 
the Vale
 of Arryn, but the Queen Regent decides not to intervene
directly on 
Littlefinger
's behalf, but only send a letter warning these Lords that no harm must come to Lord Petyr.
When the subject of rebuilding the fleet comes up, Cersei is adamant against making any pact with the 
ironborn
,
stating, "Their turn will come, once we have dealt with 
Stannis
." Aurane Waters will get his fleet of dromonds
however, and Cersei will find the coin by deferring the crown's debt to the 
Faith of the Seven
 and to the 
Iron Bank
of Braavos
 until the end of the 
war
. Pycelle warns her against this route, cautioning that it would be foolish to make
an enemy of the Iron Bank, but the decision is made regardless.
The council also discusses the prudence of making someone pay for the 
Red Wedding
 so as to appease all the
"sparrows"; and in the mean time offering whomever succeeds the sure-to-die-soon Lord 
Walder Frey
 a chance to
rid himself of unwanted brothers, half-brothers and nephews.
On the topic of the 
North
, the council indicates that Stannis may soon be confronted by 
Roose Bolton
's army, once
his bastard son
 hits 
Moat Cailin
 from the north, allowing the Lord of the 
Dreadfort
 passage through 
the Neck
. Cersei
mentions that 
Wyman Manderly
 has taken 
Davos Seaworth
 captive, after the latter was sent by Stannis to treat with
him. When 
Sansa
 is mentioned, Cersei shocks the council into silence with a violent tirade about how she plans to
deal with the girl once she is found. In the uneasy silence that follows, Cersei also remarks that Lord Bolton
possesses 
Arya Stark
 and that her marriage to his bastard should appease the north, keeping to herself the fact that
"Arya Stark" is really a "
steward's whelp
" provided by Littlefinger.
Next they debate the fact that the 
Night's Watch
 might be joining its might to Stannis, especially now that 
Jon Snow

is their Lord Commander. The council decides to warn the Watch that the crown will stop sending men to the Wall,
but Qyburn suggests that they do send 100 men. Cersei picks up on this, with the idea that the men sent will really
be assassins ordered to remove 
Eddard Stark
's bastard.
Back in her apartments, Cersei learns from 
Taena
 that 
Dorcas
 fancies 
Osney Kettleblack
, and also hints that she
herself likes dangerous, scarred men. Cersei tries to learn the name of Taena's old flame, but the 
Myrish
 woman is
evasive.
When Osney arrives, Cersei butters him up with an offer to join the 
Kingsguard
 and a chance to bed her again,
provided he accomplishes a couple of tasks. First, Cersei wants him to seduce, and hopefully bed, Queen 
Margaery
;
this will enable Cersei to execute her lawfully. Second, she plans to send him to the 
Wall
 as "punishment" for his
treason with Margaery, but in reality he will lead a group of men to assassinate 
Jon Snow
. She assures him that the
men would not be required to serve in the Watch after they complete their task, and promises him a lordship, should
he accomplish both missions.
Later that night, Cersei asks Lady Taena to remark to Margaery that she has a secret admirer, but not to let out Ser
Osney's name unless the girl probes.

Synopsis
Victarion
 has left the defense of 
Moat Cailin
 to 
Ralf Kenning
, and sailed the 
Iron Fleet
 to 
Old Wyk
 for the
kingsmoot
. When the fleet arrives at 
Nagga's Cradle
, Victarion has them blockade 
Euron
's 
Silence
. The first to greet
him on shore is 
Aeron
, and later that night the priest is at his side for the feast. Several captains pledge their voice to
Victarion's claim, but 
Lord Blacktyde
 seeks a king who will end the wars, saying,
"
Balon
 was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all."
Soon, the captain finds 
his niece
, advising her not to lay forth a claim, because a woman has no place ruling the
ironborn. Asha stands by her claim, and notes that the Damphair may have underestimated the appeal of the
Kingsmoot, since 
the Drumm
 will present his claim and there is talk of 
Maron Volmark
 being presented as heir of
the throne by 
Tarle the Thrice-Drowned
, while it is apparent that Aeron's intent was to legitimize Victarion as
Balon's successor.
Their chat is interrupted by the arrival of Euron. Victarion notes Euron does not seem to have aged in the almost
three years that he has been gone. Aeron confronts Euron with the accusation that 
"no godless man may sit the
Seastone Chair
"
, but Euron cows his brother into leaving the hall. Asha then accuses her uncle of the death of her
father, but Euron denies he had anything to do with it. When a fight nearly breaks out between Asha and one of
Euron's men, Victarion steps in and demands that Euron leave. After his departure, Victarion and his niece walk
outside, and Asha asks why Euron was banished by her father, for he refused to ever speak of it. Victarion
eventually tells her that Euron impregnated 
Victarion's wife
. Victarion wanted to kill his brother but Balon forbid it
and sent Euron to exile. Later Victarion killed his wife with his own hands.
Asha offers to set aside her claim if Victarion will name her his Hand and end the war. She feels that the Ironborn
have overextended themselves and tells her uncle that she has reached an agreement with Lady 
Sybelle Glover
, and
that their people may keep 
Sea Dragon Point
 and the 
Stony Shore
 in return for the release of 
Deepwood Motte
,
Torrhen's Square
 and 
Moat Cailin
. Victarion is not receptive. Asha replies that she then will claim the throne.

Brienne IV
Synopsis
Aeron
 is wading in the ocean, berating himself for running from 
Euron
. He considers 
Nagga's bones
, where the 
Grey
King
 ruled for 1000 years and warred against the 
Storm God
. At dawn, Aeron has his drowned men sound the drums
and warhorns to announce the onset of the kingsmoot. The prophet wishes for 
Victarion
 to win the claim, and hopes
Euron will make a mistake and declare early. But the first claimant is 
Gylbert Farwynd
, who rules a small barrier
island far to the west of the 
Iron Islands
 where shapeshifters are said to live. Aeron sees madness in the lord's eyes.
He offers to lead the ironmen to a bountiful land beyond the 
Sunset Sea
; few of the gathered captains shout his
name.
Next up is 
Erik Ironmaker
, who once might have made a great king. But age and his immense weight make him an
easy target for 
Asha
 to dismiss by asking him to stand up from his chair. The following claimant is another famous
ironborn, Lord 
Dunstan Drumm
, who asks the gathering, "Where is it written that our king must be a kraken?" But
the Drumm's downfall is the cheap loot he offers to swing the vote of the captains.
Victarion steps forth next and asks for Aeron's blessing. His speech is short and concise and he offers to continue the
rule his brother 
Balon
 set. His offerings are generous, and many captains give him their voice.
But it is Asha who interrupts the shouts of "Victarion!", and declares that her claim is best as she is Balon's
daughter. She tells the ironborn that war is bleeding their people and to continue it would be folly. She offers peace
with the Northmen, and prosperous land on the western shores of the North. When she opens her chests to show the
scant spoils of her warring in the 
Northlands
, the tumult of support she receives is staggering.
Fearing that a woman will win the kingsmoot, Aeron is shocked back to reality by the horrible bellowing of a horn.
All eyes turn to a giant war-horn bound with ancient 
Valyrian
 glyphs being sounded by 
one of Euron's "mongrels"
.
After sounding the horn several times, the giant mute nearly falls over, his lips bloody and blistering. Euron steps
forward and announces that he has sailed further and braved more than any other ironman. He offers not only peace
and land, but all of 
Westeros
 itself to the ironborn. When Asha asks him how he means to do so, her uncle responds
that he will use dragons to conquer the 
Seven Kingdoms
, as 
Aegon
 did, using the 
Dragon Horn
 he found amongst
the ashes of Old Valyria. When he tells the crowd that the horn can bind dragons to his will, and that he knows
where three dragons can be found, he receives the overwhelming cheers of "Euron! Euron! Crow's Eye! EURON
KING!"

Synopsis
On the way to the cove where 
Nimble Dick
 led the fool and his two companions, 
Pod
 catches Dick looking through
Brienne's
 saddlebags. She knew something like this might happen, and warned Pod to keep an eye on him. But
having no recourse but to follow Dick, Brienne and Pod continue on their path to 
Crackclaw Point
. Dick tells them
some of the history of the region, to pass the monotony of their journey. Brienne's mistrust of Dick has made him
take notice, and she considers how easy it is for her to suspect others, after the mistreatments she has suffered in her
life. She remembers getting her revenge on several of her false suitors during the mêlée at 
Bitterbridge
, but this has
done little to stay her natural distrust.
As they pass the 
Dyre Den
, Lord 
Brune
's castle, Pod takes note of a rider a couple miles behind them. When Brienne
learns that Dick may have known Lord Brune, she considers the possibility that Dick is a deserter from the war.
After passing through many a treacherous bog and forest, they finally arrive at the ruins of 
the Whispers
. Brienne
commands Pod to watch their horses, as she and Dick investigate the ruins. When they find a recently put-out
cookfire, Brienne realizes their quarry is still around.
The trap is soon sprung, and the fool turns out to be 
Shagwell
 of the 
Bloody Mummers
. Shagwell kills Nimble Dick
with his brutal morningstar, then informs Brienne that 
Urswyck
 rode south to

while 
Rorge
 headed for 
Saltpans
. He also reveals a rumor that the "

quickly to her strokes with

thrown by Podrick. Brienne forces the Fool to dig a grave for Dick, but upon completion of it, the former Brave

wall. It is Ser

Synopsis
At a hidden well at 
Shandystone
 in the desert of 
Dorne
, 
Arianne
 and her most trusted companions are awaiting the
arrival of 
Myrcella
 and her sworn sword. Although Arianne has the utmost trust in 
Garin
, 
Drey
 and 
Sylva
, she is still
unsure about 
Gerold Dayne
 the Darkstar. She considers his cruel nature and the mystery surrounding him. She is
worried that 
Arys
 may be wary of him. But if this would happen and they would to come to blows, who would win?
Garin warns Arianne that he does not like the man, but she reminds him that they may need his sword and
eventually 
his castle
. Later, Darkstar tells her that this scheme to crown Myrcella will not work as she has planned.
He then unsheathes his sword, and reveals that you incite a war with steel (meaning they should kill Myrcella).
When Arys and Princess Myrcella arrive, Arianne introduces the girl to her companions. Myrcella recalls the great
knight 
Arthur Dayne
 when she meets Darkstar, which seems to upset the Knight of 
High Hermitage
, because in his
mind people always remember his cousin for his famous sword. Arys draws Arianne off alone and reveals that
Tywin Lannister
 is dead.
They set off at night for the 
Greenblood
, where they will take an orphan's barge west along the river. Myrcella is
confused, having been told nothing by Arys, especially the fact that everyone keeps calling her "your Grace".
Arianne tells her some of their plan, that they intend to crown her Queen, because her brother 
Tommen
 was being
controlled by evil councillors. During the trip, Myrcella asks Garin why they call him "an orphan of the Greenblood"
when he has a mother and father. He explains that it is a metaphor for their mourning the loss of their homeland, and
the "mother" river the 
Rhoyne
. They built barges along the Greenblood and hammered them together, as they did in
their ancestral land, for they were never comfortable in the deserts of Dorne.
As Arianne is considering her plan to crown Myrcella at 
Hellholt
, where 
Ellaria Sand
's father 
Harmen Uller
 rules,
they reach the river and spot the barge that Garin's people promised would be waiting. But as they get closer, 
Areo
Hotah
 steps from the cabin with a dozen crossbowmen. Arianne yells for them to flee, while Drey recommends they
yield. But Arys Oakheart charges the boat, intent on protecting his two princesses at all costs. Hit with several bolts,
he reaches the deck but falls to Captain Hotah's longaxe. As Arianne falls off her horse screaming "No!", she hears
Myrcella shrieking, and Hotah commanding horsemen to chase after Darkstar, who fled. Arianne notices Myrcella
on her hands and knees, her head in her hands and blood streaming down her arms. Then she is brought before
Hotah, pleading to know how her father discovered what she planned. The Captain of the Guards responds,
"Someone told. Someone always tells."

Cat of the Canals
Synopsis
Every day, the 
kindly man
 asks 
Arya
 who she is. When she replies "no one", he tells her that she lies, trying to get
her to forget her true self and give up her past, but Arya resists. She works hard in the temple, cleaning and doing
other chores. She witnesses many people entering the temple, some to light candles, others to curl up near a statue to
die, and others to speak in private to the kindly man. When asked whose names she whispers at night, she finally
admits that they are people she wants to kill, but the priest tells her that it is the 
Many-Faced God
 who determines
who shall die, not her. He also finally convinces her to dispose of her possessions, and she does so with all but
Needle
, which she hides outside the temple under a stone. Once she has done this, the kindly man comes to her and
tells her some of their history.
The 
Faceless Men
 are older than 
Braavos
, having started amongst the slaves working the mines beneath the
volcanoes of the 
Valyrian Freehold
. The slaves worked under the harshest of conditions, and since they came from
many different nations, they all prayed to different gods. But one amongst them (although he may have actually
been a noble's son or an overseer, no one knows) realized that they were actually all praying to one god- one who
could set them free from their torture.
The kindly man does not finish the story, but now Arya is a novice at the temple, and she and the 
waif
 begin to teach
each other their respective languages. As Arya learns Braavosi, the waif also teaches her how to read a lie on
someone's face, and Arya discovers that the girl is actually well over thirty years old, having taken "poisons" as part
of her sacrifice to become Faceless. One day, when other priests of the Many-Faced God visit the temple, Arya asks
the kindly man how to change her face, as 
Jaqen H'ghar
 did. While the priest knows not the name, he tells her it
takes years of prayer, sacrifice and study to accomplish what he could do. Still, Arya wishes to learn, so he tells her
to begin training the muscles of her face in front of a mirror every day. The next day, the kindly man tells Arya that
she must leave the temple for a while, so as to learn the Braavosi tongue by being amongst them all the time. He
instructs her to find a fishmonger named 
Brusco
, but to not reveal who she really is. Arya decides to use the name
"Cat", pretending to be an orphan girl from 
King's Landing
.

Alayne II
Synopsis
Sansa
 is now completely in the role of 
Alayne Stone
, and she has considerable influence in the 
Eyrie
. On the
balcony of her rooms in the 
Maiden's Tower
, she surveys the armies of the 
Lords Declarant
 camped outside the
Gates of the Moon
. Lord 
Gilwood Hunter
 arrived first, and immediately blockaded supplies from reaching the Eyrie.
Though they are not yet under siege, the situation looks dire from her standpoint. Lord 
Robert
, even more irritable
than normal because there are no eggs or bacon, tells Alayne that he still hears 
Marillion
 singing every night. Alayne
assures him that the bard is dead, although she has not seen the body, but she herself no longer hears singing. When
Littlefinger
 arrives, he informs them that the Lords Declarant are on their way up to the Eyrie for a parley. He tells
Alayne that there will be eight of them, but he is only concerned about 
Lyn Corbray
. We learn that Lyn fought
against 
Jon Arryn
 at 
Gulltown
 at the onset of 
Robert's Rebellion
, but later fought alongside him at the 
Trident
, where
he slew Prince 
Lewyn Martell
 of the 
Kingsguard
 and broke the Dornish line. While his 
elder brother
 supports Petyr's
position as Lord Protector of the Vale, Ser Lyn has taken up with the Lords Declarant. Bearing the Valyrian sword
Lady Forlorn
, Ser Lyn is a dangerous and unpredictable man, quick to demand a duel.
The Lords Declarant seek to defend Lord Robert and the Vale, but do not acknowledge the Lord Protector, naming
him a false counselor who has been misruling the Vale. After Robert has another fit, Littlefinger suggests that
Maester 
Colemon
 try giving him 
sweetsleep
, although the 
maester
 seems reticent to do so. Alayne tells her "father"
that 
Yohn Royce
 will recognize her, having met her at 
Winterfell
 when 
Waymar Royce
 took the black, but Petyr
explains that "men see what they expect to see." She also asks him why he doesn't leave the Vale to take up his
position as Lord of 
Harrenhal
. Littlefinger is convinced the place is cursed, especially after what happened to 
Tywin
Lannister
, 
Gregor Clegane
, and 
Vargo Hoat
. Lady 
Shella Whent
 recently died without any heirs, claiming yet
another family that once ruled at 
Black Harren
's nightmare castle. When Alayne recommends that he give Harrenhal
to Lord 
Walder Frey
, Petyr smiles and tells her he might, but he would really like to give it to 
Cersei
, although he
might have to "remove her from the game" sooner than planned, unless she removes herself first.
Alayne leads the Lords Declarant up to Petyr's solar, where he confounds them by saying that he would like to sign
their declaration to weed out the false counselors. But Yohn Royce tells him they did not come to obtain his
signature; they are here to remove Littlefinger and take Lord Robert to foster at 
Runestone
. Petyr informs them that
he plans to foster the sons of other lords here so that Robert will have boys his own age around. He also asks Lady
Anya Waynwood
 to send 
Harrold Hardyng
 to the Eyrie as his ward, but the Lords scoff at this request. Littlefinger
refuses their demand that he leave the Vale and turn over Robert, and after he calls their bluffs of violence, Lyn
Corbray draws Lady Forlorn, but this enrages the other Lords Declarant, and Bronze Yohn tells the knight to up his
steel, reminding him that they are guests. Corbray stalks off, but this has worked to Littlefinger's advantage, as he
now turns hostile toward the Lords. Demanding that they lift their encampment and give him one year to set the
Vale to rights or else he will willingly step down as Lord Protector, all the Lords except Yohn Royce agree, and
Petyr emerges victorious in the parley.
Later that night, after the Lords have departed, Alayne asks Petyr what he plans for the next year. Littlefinger
continues his tutelage of Alayne in playing the game of thrones. He states that one or two of the older Lords may die
over the course of the year, and Lord 
Gilwood Hunter
 may well be killed by his younger brother 
Harlan
, who
arranged old Lord 
Eon
's death. he tells her that he can be bought "with gold and boys and promises."

Synopsis
Cersei
 continues to obliviously move from one folly to the next. Angered by 
Tommen
's brazen demand to sit on the
Iron Throne
 and at council, she realizes that 
Margaery
 put him up to this. Cersei refuses to give her power up to
anyone, at least until Tommen comes of age.
Next, she sends away the 
Iron Bank
's envoy 
Noho Dimittis
 after telling him there will be no payment until the
rebellion is ended. She receives word from 
Pycelle
 that Lord 
Manderly
 had Ser 
Davos
 beheaded, and the 
Freys
confirmed this. Later, she speaks with 
Osmund Kettleblack
 about his 
younger brother
's failed efforts to bed
Margaery. Osmund swears that the young queen likes him, but that they are never alone. The 
Kingsguard
 names
some of those always around her, including the male singers she prefers to entertain her and her companions.
When Cersei crosses the yard and finds Tommen riding at the quintain, she is infuriated. Once again, this was
Margaery's idea, and while all those gathered are cheering the young king's jousting ability, Cersei blunders by
saying, "One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did." Margaery astutely catches this and asks what tourneys
King Robert
 had won. The Queen Regent evades this by mentioning Robert's deeds at the Trident. She then berates
Loras
 for teaching Tommen how to ride, but the Kingsguard reminds her that there has been no master-at-arms at
the 
Red Keep
 since 
Aron Santagar
 was killed. Walking back to her solar, she considers sending for another Dornish
master-at-arms, just to irk the 
Tyrells
.
In her solar, 
Qyburn
 informs her that Prince 
Doran
 has imprisoned 
Daemon Sand
 for demanding the release of the
Sand Snakes
, and that 
Sylva Santagar
 has been hastily married to the elderly 
Eldon Estermont
. He also tells her that
both Daemon Sand and Sylva are close friends of Doran's daughter 
Arianne
. Cersei could not care less, but she is
interested to hear of a treasonous puppet show. She commands Qyburn to have the four puppeteers put to death, but
Qyburn wants the women for his "experiments". Cersei has already given him 
Senelle
, but he tells her she didn't last.
The Queen Regent recalls her screaming in the darkness when she was down in the 
black cells
, but grants Qyburn
his test subjects. Later, as she is bathing in preparation for dinner, 
Jaime
 arrives with Tommen, who is demanding to
see her. The boy king wants his horse tomorrow so that Loras can continue training him, but his mother will have
none of it. Jaime mocks her for suggesting that Ser Osmund is thrice the knight Ser Loras is, but Cersei finally
convinces her son to wait for a new master-at-arms to be named.
As she gets dressed, Cersei recalls her fit of rage when her washerwoman shrunk several of her gowns; but it is
obvious she is unaware that she is actually gaining weight from all the alcohol. Her guests for dinner are 
Falyse
Stokeworth
 and her husband, 
Balman Byrch
. It is revealed that 
Tanda Stokeworth
 has been thrown from her horse
and fractured her hip, but Cersei thinks to herself that Tanda will not recover from the wound at her age. Falyse says
she was refused hospitality by the 
ward of Lord Gyles Rosby
 and that she encountered 
ruffians
 on the road. Cersei
deftly convinces Falyse and Balman that she fears 
Bronn
 is either hiding Tyrion or gathering swords for him, and
may mean to try and kill Tommen. They assure her that it was solely Bronn's responsibility for naming 
Lollys's
bastard son "
Tyrion
", but Balman gets the hint that Cersei would like to see the ex-sellsword disposed of, and tells
her not to worry any further.
On her way to bed, Cersei peeks in on Tommen and sees three kittens in bed with him. 
Meryn Trant
 informs her that

Margaery gave them to him. That night, Cersei thinks of Prince 
Rhaegar Targaryen
, and how King 
Aerys
 blocked
their betrothal out of spite. When she was 10, her father and her aunt 
Genna
 promised she would be betrothed to
Rhaegar after the 
tourney for King Aerys II
 in 
Lannisport
. She was so happy that she agreed to visit the witch
Maggy
 the Frog with her friends. They laughed at her prophesies, but that night King Aerys mocked Lord Tywin for
thinking he would give his son's hand to his servant Tywin's daughter. And after that, Maggy's predictions started to
come true, one after another.

Synopsis
Staying at an inn in 
Braavos
, 
Sam
 is nearing wits' end. 
Dareon
 has abandoned them for the brothels, 
Gilly
 remains
inconsolable, and Maester 
Aemon
's health deteriorates daily. To make matters worse, Sam had spent nearly all their
coin on their rooms, a healer for Aemon, and passage on a boat, 
Lady Ushanora
, that they wound up unable to board
due to the maester's health. Feverish and dying, the maester begs Sam to return to the docks to learn more about this
rumor of dragons that Dareon had heard at some winesink. Aemon mumbles to Sam, "Dragons. The grief and glory
of 
my house
... 
My brothers
 dreamed of dragons too, and the dreams killed them, every one. Sam, we tremble on the
cusp of half-remembered prophecies... I should have seen it. Fire consumes, but cold preserves. 
The Wall
..."
Sam departs that night to find Dareon, but gets accosted by two bravos because he is wearing a sword. However, he
is saved by 
Cat of the Canals
, who tells him of another black brother about to wed the 
Sailor's Wife
. Sam finds
Dareon at the 
Happy Port
, but his brother from 
the Watch
 wants nothing more to do with the black, or Gilly and
Aemon for that matter. Sam punches him in the face, but gets tossed into the canal by the proprietors of the brothel.
He is saved from drowning by 
Xhondo
, a huge 
Summer Islander
, who is a mate aboard the 
Cinnamon Wind
 and
knows of these dragons that Sam had mentioned.

Synopsis
Aware that 
Cersei
 is trying to rid herself of him, 
Jaime
 argues that his place is beside the king, not off laying siege to
Riverrun
. But his sister responds that she can't rely on 
Daven
, and needs Jaime to defeat 
Brynden Tully
, as well as
find out why 
Gregor's men
 at 
Harrenhal
 have not released 
Wylis Manderly
 as the crown requested. She states that
Osmund Kettleblack
 will command the 
Kingsguard
 in his absence, although Jaime dislikes the idea.
Jaime's command consists of 
Kennos
, 
Dermot
, 
Strongboar
, 
Red Ronnet
, as well as 
Ilyn Payne
 and 
Addam
Marbrand
, whom Jaime demanded as concessions from his sister.
On the first night, they guest at Castle 
Hayford
, and Jaime considers the fate of his cousin 
Tyrek
, who would be lord
of the castle were he not missing. He thinks it possible the boy is still alive, perhaps having been secreted off by
command of 
Varys
, who very well could have known that the riot would occur.
Starting that night, Ser Jaime begins training every night with Ilyn Payne, in the hopes that he can become a
proficient swordsman with his left hand. The company also visits 
Sow's Horn
 and meets with Ser 
Roger Hogg
.
Arriving at 
Harrenhal
, Jaime has Gregor Clegane's men release all prisoners, including Wylis Manderly, and then
leaves Ser 
Bonifer Hasty
 and the 
Holy Hundred
 to hold the castle until 
Petyr Baelish
 takes up its lordship. Jaime
commands Bonifer to kill 
Sandor Clegane
 or 
Thoros of Myr
 if either are captured, but requests he send him any
Bloody Mummers
 or 
Beric Dondarrion
 should they fall into his hands.
Outside, Jaime comes across 
Ronnet Connington
, who mentions how he once was betrothed to 
Brienne
. When
Ronnet mocks Brienne, Jaime hits him in the face with his golden hand and insists he call her by name.

Cersei VII
Synopsis
Cersei
 and 
Taena
 share the queen's litter en route to the 
Great Sept of Baelor
. The lady from 
Myr
 is telling Cersei
about all the men who are always around 
Margaery
, and how she was present for the bedding at 
Renly
's wedding.
Although Taena is not sure if Margaery is still a maiden, she affirms that Renly was aroused. She also lets on that
besides all the 
knights
 and bards, 
Pycelle
 is a frequent visitor of the young queen, and her brother 
Loras
 visits
perhaps more than any other. They also discuss the new 
High Septon
, a man who was once a "
sparrow
" and not a
member of the 
Most Devout
. This is not only surprising, but also of concern to Cersei, and she considers that she
may have to poison this new leader of the Seven, if he becomes unruly.
Reaching the top of 
Visenya's Hill
, the queen's litter can continue no further as the streets are packed with
"sparrows". Continuing on foot, Cersei considers Pycelle's objection to her choice of 
Osfryd Kettleblack
 to replace
Addam Marbrand
 as the commander of the City Watch. She takes note of all the bones and skulls piled up around
the statue of Baelor, and is told that they are the remains of septons and septas who were killed by the war, because
they received no protection from the Throne. At the doors to the Great Sept, armed men block the 
Kingsguards
'
entry since they bear weapons. Cersei must enter alone, and as she does she wonders about these anointed knights
answering the call to defend 
the Faith
.
Inside the Sept, she is appalled to find Septon 
Raynard
 in roughspun robes scrubbing the floors, and learns that
Septon 
Torbert
 has been imprisoned for being obese when so many are starving. She berates the new High Septon,
this "sparrow" wearing frayed robes and standing before her barefoot. He tells her that the Faith has sold the crown
her father gave his predecessor, as well as all the valuables in their vaults, in order to help feed the poor. Cersei
recalls 
Qyburn
's report that the "sparrows" broke down the doors of the Sept before the final vote with axes in their
hands and their leader on their shoulders. She now understands how this man was elected High Septon. Speaking in
private, the priest reprimands her for beheading 
Ned Stark
 on the steps of the Great Sept, and reveals that he hasn't
come to the 
Red Keep
 to bless King 
Tommen
 because he is still praying for guidance from 
the Seven
 to affirm that
the boy is the rightful king. The Queen Regent begins to seethe with anger, but concedes to his concerns that the
holy men and women on the roads need protection from rape and murder: Cersei agrees to have Tommen rearm the
Faith, something King 
Maegor
 forbade almost 300 years ago. She promises to restore the 
Faith Militant
, for which
the High Septon will acknowledge Tommen as king and forgive the Crown's debt to the Faith.
Back in her litter, Cersei tells Taena of her triumph: with one stroke she has gotten the Faith to bless Tommen,
reduced the Throne's debt by almost a million dragons, and cleared the city of "sparrows" by restoring the 
Warrior's
Sons
 and the 
Poor Fellows
. Yet she doesn't realize the repercussions of what she has set in motion. On the way back
to the Red Keep, Cersei's litter encounters Margaery's entourage returning from a horse ride and picnic. Margaery
tells Cersei that she should share some of the burden of ruling the realm. But Cersei laughs at her, especially when
the young queen tells her she is always well protected by her brother Loras when she goes riding.

Synopsis
Victarion Greyjoy
's 
Iron Victory
 has rammed one of the longships of the 
Shield Islands
. Victarion kills 
Talbert Serry
of 
Southshield
, and the ironborn's massive fleet is soon victorious in their conquest of the Shield Islands which sit at
the mouth of the 
Mander
 River north of the Port of 
Oldtown
. It is Victarion's command that won the battle, but it
will be King 
Euron
 they cheer for engineering their bold attack. Back in his cabin, as the 
dusky woman
 Euron gave
him tends his wounds, Victarion recalls 
Aeron
's words that he would find a way to remove Euron from the 
Seastone
Chair
. He remembers how he had helped capture Lord 
Baelor Blacktyde
, who had refused to acknowledge Euron
and paid for it with his life. 
Asha
, however, had escaped the Iron Islands along with those loyal to her.
Landing at 
Lord Hewett's Town
 on 
Oakenshield
, the Lord Captain meets the 
Reader
 and the 
Drumm
. Both are
worried that Euron's little conquest will bring ruin down upon them, as surely 
Highgarden
 will respond. At the feast,
Victarion notes that Euron has shamed Lord Hewett and his wife and daughters. The recently crowned king then
raises 
Harras Harlaw
, 
Andrik
 the Unsmiling, 
Maron Volmark
 and 
Nute
 the Barber to Lords of the four Shield
Islands, effectively stealing away the lieutenants of his adversaries.
Euron declares that they will sail the next day with provisions plundered from the Shield Islands; selling the slaves
they had just taken in the 
Free Cities
 on their way to find the dragons he had promised. But many of the captains
object, stating that they should attack Oldtown or the 
Arbor
, and Euron stalks from the hall. Soon, one of Euron's
bastard sons tells the Iron Captain that the king wishes to see him.
In his room, Euron tells his brother that the Reader was correct that the whole fleet could never reach 
Slaver's Bay
together. But he believes that the Iron Fleet alone could, and promises his brother the Seastone Chair as reward if he
sails to 
Slaver's Bay
 and returns with 
Daenerys
. Euron means to marry her and ascend to the 
Iron Throne
. With 
Lord
Blacktyde's
 words that 
Euron was maddest of them all
 on his mind, Victarion agrees to go, thinking to himself,
You stole 
my wife
 and despoiled her, so I'll have yours.

Synopsis
Jaime
's small host reaches Castle 
Darry
, and he finds himself contemplating the genius of his uncle 
Kevan
 for his
choice of a bride for 
Lancel
, 
Amerei Frey
, whose mother is a 
Darry
.
He has dispatched 
Red Ronnet
 to accompany 
Wylis Manderly
 to 
Maidenpool
, but nevertheless he has too many men
to be fed at his cousin's new castle. Jaime takes note of all the armed 
Freys
 and "sparrows" in the castle, far
outnumbering Lannister men. Darry's maester greets Ser Jaime, surprised by this unexpected visit, and tells him that
Kevan departed right after the wedding, and that Lancel is praying in the sept. The maester provides him with
Lancel's own room, since Jaime's cousin has taken to sleeping in the sept. As Jaime bathes before the guest feast, he
notices that 
Josmyn Peckledon
, his new squire, wishes to bed 
Pia
. Jaime tells him to use Lancel's room for his first
bedding, saying, "You'll feel a lord yourself when you're done, if Pia knows her business." But Jaime warns him to
treat her kindly, perhaps due to his own guilt for refusing the girl when 
Qyburn
 sent her during his recuperation at
Harrenhal
.
At the feast, Jaime learns that his cousin has been fasting since the old 
High Septon
 died. Lancel also does not join
them for dinner. Lady Amerei begs Jaime to stay and help them defeat Lord 
Beric Dondarrion
, the 
Hound
, and the
other outlaws. He learns that the outlaws seem to be following 
a woman
 now, cloaked and hooded, and no one has
seen Beric Dondarrion for a while. Jaime's companion 
Strongboar
 claims to be moved by Ami's words, and
promises to return after they take 
Riverrun
 to sort out the Hound. Jaime leaves the table and goes to the sept. Three
armed sparrows bar his path, but Lancel lets him in.
Lancel admits that his father left after they quarrelled, and that he does not intend to consummate his marriage. And
then he admits his greatest sins: serving the wine that resulted in King 
Robert
's death, and that he had been sleeping
with 
Cersei
.
Lancel states that he plans to forsake his title as Lord of Darry, and head to 
King's Landing
 to swear vows as a
Warrior's Son
. When Jaime learns that Cersei has rearmed the faith, he is almost as upset by this as he is to discover
that 
Tyrion
 was not lying about Cersei's infidelity. Later, in the yard, Jaime admits to Ser 
Ilyn
 that he slept with
Cersei when she was at Castle Darry with Robert. Cersei wanted him to get 
Arya Stark
 and he would have killed her
had he found her first.

Brienne VII
Synopsis
Upon reaching the 
Quiet Isle
, 
Brienne
 and her companions are taken up the path to see the 
Elder Brother
. Brienne
mentions to the brother guiding them that she is heading for 
Saltpans
 to kill 
the Hound
. This takes the man aback,
but he tells them to speak to their elder. They see a huge horse in their stables, obviously a war horse, who has
mauled two of the brothers. On a hill, they pass a 
huge cloaked novice
 digging graves. The man appears lame, but
they cannot see his face.
The Elder Brother speaks further of the horrible raid on Saltpans, made worse by the fact that Ser 
Quincy Cox
 hid
behind his castle walls and did nothing to help the villagers.
After dinner, the Elder Brother speaks in private with Brienne. He asks what she seeks in Saltpans, and when she
mentions a highborn girl, the elder knows she refers to 
Sansa
. He lets on that it is the wrong Stark she seeks, for the
Hound captured 
Arya
. Shocked that both of Lady 
Catelyn
's daughters may yet be alive, she is equally surprised
when he informs her that Sandor Clegane is dead. The Elder Brother has buried his corpse himself, and left the
hound's-head helm on the grave. It was 
some other outlaw
 who found and wore it when they raided Saltpans.
He goes on to tell her that he took pity on Sandor before he died, and will only say that 
"he is at rest"
 when she asks
if he is truly dead. The elder remarks that the horse in their stables was the Hound's, 
Stranger
.
The Elder Brother then tells her that he was once a knight who fought for Prince 
Rhaegar
 at the 
Trident
. He took
several terrible wounds in the battle and fell into the river, yet awoke upon the shores of the Quiet Isle. He urges her
not to be another casualty of this war, and return home. Brienne breaks down and cries, telling him her story,
finishing with, 
"I have to try to save her... or die in the attempt."

Cersei VIII
Synopsis
Margaery
 is fuming at 
Cersei
 and 
her council
 that the Throne must respond at once to the 
ironmen's attack on the
Shield Islands
. Cersei does not appreciate the young queen's tone, and claims that it must fall to 
Highgarden
 to
retake "these rocks". 
Loras Tyrell
 interjects as his sister seethes, stating that his brothers 
Willas
 and 
Garlan
 have the
men, but not the ships, to win back the islands. He requests that Cersei pull Lord 
Redwyne
's fleet from their 
siege of
Dragonstone
, so they may return to gather troops at the 
Arbor
. The Queen Regent denies his request, implying that
the Redwyne fleet would not depart until 
Dragonstone
 fell. Knowing that Lord Paxter intended to starve them out,
Ser Loras asks leave to lead the assault, and promises Cersei Dragonstone within a fortnight. Pleased by this
unexpected "gift", Cersei grants him permission.
Returning to her apartments, 
Pycelle
 objects to her sending Loras, but Cersei is hoping the knight will die besieging
the walls of Dragonstone; but if not, she would still strike a blow against 
Stannis
. When she meets 
Qyburn
, he
mentions that he has a "champion" to replace Loras should he fall. Cersei is not so sure of Qyburn's "paragon", and
informs him that the smiths she hired believe the weight of the armor he requested cannot be borne by a human.
Later, in bed, Lady 
Taena
 asks her certain questions; Cersei becomes concerned the woman may report her answers
to Margaery. But Taena assures her that all her secrets are safe. However, their chat is interrupted by a guard
pounding on her door with word that 
Falyse Stokeworth
 begged to see her. Cersei finds the woman battered, and
listens to the tale of 
her husband
's death. After 
Bronn
 defeated him in single combat, but before killing him, Bronn
forced Ser Balman to confess who put him up to this. Bronn then told Falyse to leave immediately or meet the same
fate. When Falyse told 
her mother
's guards to arrest Bronn, they laughed and told her to listen to "Lord Stokeworth".
Fearful that Falyse would spread rumors of Cersei's involvement, Cersei summons Lord Qyburn so that he could
take another female subject to his lab in the 
black cells
. Back in her room, a very inebriated Cersei contemplates
how to deal with Bronn, and then begins to fondle Taena, "claiming her rights as queen" the way 
Robert
 would do to
her when he was drunk.

Jaime VI
Synopsis
Reaching the camps besieging 
Riverrun
, 
Jaime
 meets with his cousin Ser 
Daven
. The new Warden of the West spits
when he discovers that it was 
Vargo Hoat
 who had Jaime's hand amputated, informing him that he offered 
Tywin
 to
forage for Hoat, but he refused, saying that some tasks are fit for lions, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs.
Daven reveals how much the 
Freys
 are vexing him, and even their own uncle 
Emmon Frey
 is trying his patience,
complaining that he doesn't want his new seat destroyed by a siege. Worst of all is Ser 
Ryman
, who keeps tying a
noose around 
Edmure Tully
's neck each morning threatening the 
Blackfish
 that he means to hang him unless
Riverrun surrenders; however, the Blackfish has long exposed Ryman's threat to be empty.
They speak of 
Lancel
 and his abandonment of 
Darry
, which reminds Jaime of the looks on 
Ami
's family's faces
when Lancel made his intentions clear. He is all too aware of how Lord 
Walder
 
deals with
 
those who break Frey
marriage proposals
. Daven tells the Lord Commander that their uncle 
Kevan
 passed through the camps heading
west. He also mentions that Edmure's wife 
Roslin
 is pregnant, and oddly she is fond of the dispossessed Lord of
Riverrun. He also tells Jaime of Lord 
Gawen Westerling
 constantly hounding him to rescue his wife and children,
who are being held captive by Ser Brynden Tully.
Jaime is perturbed to learn how little help they are receiving from the bannermen of the Tullys who bent the knee to
the 
Iron Throne
 after the 
Red Wedding
. He realizes that he must secure Riverrun quickly to put down any threat of
rebellion. Starving them out would take far too long.
The next morning, Jaime is considering a parley with Ser Brynden, and recalls when he was a squire of 
Sumner
Crakehall
, sent to Riverrun with a message. Lord 
Hoster
 seated Jaime next to 
Lysa
, but the young man was far more
interested in Lysa's famous uncle, the Blackfish. Within sight of the walls of Riverrun, Jaime has his tent pitched,
and soon receives a visit from his Aunt 
Genna
 and her husband, Emmon Frey.
Genna is still a Lannister through-and-through, with the wit and sharp tongue also shared by all of Lord 
Tywin
's
children. Jaime lies to them that their son 
Cleos
 died bravely, and then listens to Emmon's complaints about a siege
damaging his castle. Jaime enlightens Emmon to the fact that he was named Lord of Riverrun, but 
Petyr Baelish
 is
the 
Lord Paramount of the Trident
. Emmon is outraged to learn he is a vassal of Petyr, but Jaime is unconcerned, as
there is nothing he can do about it and Cersei won't indulge someone like Emmon Frey. Genna tells Emmon to leave
so she can speak in private with her nephew.
Lady Genna makes it known how she feels about Queen 
Cersei
 rearming the Faith (namely that the decision is
idiotic, given the trouble the 
Faith Militant
 caused the 
Targaryens
 before they were finally put down and disbanded),
Cersei's choice of councillors, in particular rejecting her brother Kevan as Hand, and Lancel's foolish decision to
leave behind his lordship. When Jaime remarks that he plans to treat with Ser Brynden, his aunt tells him that he
would be better off beheading Edmure. But Jaime feels this may further the Blackfish's resolve, and would sooner
assault the walls of Riverrun if a parley will not work.
At last, they discuss Lord Tywin, and Jaime asks her if she loved her eldest brother. Lady Genna tells him how it

was Tywin, a boy of only ten, who objected to their lord father's decision to wed the seven year old Genna to
Emmon Frey, who was not even the heir to 
the Twins
. For that alone, she loved him, stating, 
"...every little girl
needs a big brother to protect her. Who will protect us now?"
When Jaime insists that he is his father's son, his aunt replies, 
"You smile like 
Gerion
 and fight like 
Tyg
, and there's
some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak... but 
Tyrion
 is Tywin's son, not you."

Synopsis
Acclimated to the routine of Cat of the Canals, 
Arya
 is learning the 
Braavosi tongue
 and trying to learn three new
things every time she is sent forth from the 
House of Black and White
, as the 
kindly man
 told her she must. Selling
clams by day, she sleeps in a bed with 
Brusco
's daughters by night, and for three days during each black moon, she
returns to the House of Black and White. She delivers all three things the kindly man wants her to learn, but he still
sends her back to Brusco. He tells her of the 
Many-Faced God
; especially how all religions are aware of him, even if
they do not worship him. Even within 
the Seven
 there exists 
the Stranger
, whom the kindly man calls "Him of Many
Faces".
One night when the black moon begins, she meets 
Dareon
 after he departs the Happy Port. Arya is angered by the
singer's abandonment of his vows as a 
black brother
. Returning to Brusco's, she gives him the coin she has collected
selling his mollusks and a pair of new boots, then heads to the House of Black and White for three nights.
The 
waif
 teaches her how to identify certain poisons like 
Sweetsleep
 and the 
Tears of Lys
, and then tells her the full
story of how she came to the temple. She claims to be the eldest child from an ancient house, but when her
stepmother had a true daughter, the woman tried to poison the waif. When her father discovered this, he delivered
two-thirds of his wealth to the House of Black and White, and soon after, his second wife was dead and the waif
now a servant in the temple. She reveals that she lied about part of that tale, but before Arya can guess which part,
the kindly man visits her. She tells him the three new things she has learned, finishing with the knowledge that
Dareon is dead- his throat was slit and his body dumped in the canal. When the kindly man asks who killed him, she
replies, "Arya of 
House Stark
." The priest again asks her who she is, to which she answers, "no one". But, as always,
he tells her she lies, then asks the waif to bring Arya some warm milk to help her sleep. Arya goes to bed, but upon
awakening in the morning, she discovers that she is blind.

Synopsis
The 
Cinnamon Wind
 is somewhere off the coast of 
Dorne
 as 
Sam
 leads a prayer service to mourn the passing of
Aemon Targaryen
. 
Xhondo
's information on the three dragons had given Maester Aemon a second wind, but it was
not enough. Sam recalls some of the ancient 
maester
's words during the sea voyage from 
Braavos
, "No one ever
looked for a girl. It was a prince that was promised... 
Rhaegar
, I thought... The error crept in from the translation.
Dragons
 are neither male nor female... 
Daenerys
 is the one, born amidst salt and smoke... Lady 
Melisandre
 has
misread the signs. 
Stannis
 has some of the dragon blood in him, yes... 
Rhaelle
, 
Egg
's little girl, she was how they
(the Baratheons) came by it... They must send her a maester. Daenerys must be counseled, taught, protected..."
Aemon begged Sam to convince the archmaesters of this, and later rambled some of the following (perhaps
prophetic) lines: "a glass candle that could not be lit; eggs that would not hatch; the sphinx was the riddle, not the
riddler."
Gilly
 and Sam sit together after the eulogy, drinking rum. Gilly points out that had Aemon remained on the 
Wall
,
Melisandre might have sacrificed him for his king's blood. 
Jon
 must have known this, and sent the old maester, as
well as 
Dalla
's boy, to save them from the Red Woman's fires. Gilly then says that she will name the boy Aemon
Steelsong once he reaches the age of two. Below decks, Sam and Gilly have sex, although he is consumed by guilt
for forsaking his vows. Afterwards, Sam tries to avoid Gilly, but 
Kojja
 corners him and tells him that what he and
Gilly did was considered holy in the 
Summer Islands
, a way of honoring the dead by celebrating life. Kojja advises
Sam that Gilly knows they can never be man and wife, but there was nothing wrong with them comforting each
other on the long journey. Sam is persuaded, but perhaps it is because Kojja threatens to throw him overboard if he
does not continue sleeping with Gilly.

Cersei IX
Synopsis
Lord 
Aurane Waters
 has returned from 
Dragonstone
 with news that the fortress has fallen. This was good news
indeed, considering that word from the 
Reach
 mentioned the ironmen raiding the 
Arbor
 and pushing towards
Oldtown
. Aurane indicates that Ser 
Loras
 was grievously wounded during the assault and lay dying after having had
boiling oil poured on him from the walls; he also holds Loras responsible for turning the battle into a massacre, as
thousands of the Crown's soldiers died in the storming of Dragonstone's keep, many of them knights or lords.
Ecstatic, 
Cersei
 had to deliver the news personally to 
Margaery
. The young queen is appalled by Cersei's description
of the fate of her brother, and commands Cersei to get out of her quarters. Back in her solar, four separate men bring
word on a dwarf sighting, and one brings her a head. However, none of them bear word related to 
Tyrion
, and Cersei
sends them away in frustation. Later, in court, Cersei must deal with several unimportant pleas, and then Septon
Raynard
 arrives. Furious that the 
High Septon
 himself did not come before her, she scoffs at his words that the 
Faith
is trying to abolish the brothels in the city.
Pycelle
 brings word that Lord 
Gyles
 may not live much longer, but Cersei demands that the Grand Maester do his
utmost to keep the old man alive. At dinner with her son, 
Tommen
 mentions that Margaery has been urging him to
attend court, to which Cersei responds how much she'd like to see the young queen's tongue torn out. Tommen yells
at his mother, but she commands Ser 
Boros
 to chastise the boy king's 
whipping boy
. During the night, Cersei dreams
of her visit to the witch back when she was 10 years old. She vividly recalls 
Maggy the Frog
's plea that they leave
her, but Cersei and 
Melara
 will not back down. Maggy commands them to cut open their thumbs, and the old
easterner tastes their blood. She prophesized that Cersei would marry the 
king
 (not the 
Prince
, as Cersei thought),
but her husband would father 16 children and Cersei only three, and that she would reign as queen only "until there
comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear... Gold shall be their
crowns and gold their shrouds. And when your tears have drowned you, the 
valonqar
 shall wrap his hands about
your pale white throat and choke the life from you." Maggy also warns that Melara will die very soon, and true
enough, she drowns in a well shortly after.
Waking from the nightmare, she sends for Pycelle to make her a potion that permits sleep without dreams. She asks
him if seeing the future is possible, but the old maester evades answering by saying, "Should our morrows be
foretold? And to that I should answer, 'No.' Some doors are best left closed." Aggravated, she sends for 
Qyburn
, first
asking if 
Falyse
 was still capable of being used to root out 
Bronn
. But the necromancer tells her it is too late for that.
Then she inquires of him the same she had asked of Pycelle. We learn that Maggy was from the far east, and had
married a wealthy merchant. Their son was "upjumped" to a petty lord by Cersei's grandfather. Qyburn tells her that
the name Maggy was probably a mispronunciation of "maegi", and that bloodmagic was very powerful. The de-
chained maester suggests that she already knew how to forestall the prophecy. Seizing upon this suggestion, Cersei
plans a fool-proof way to have Margaery killed. Deciding that treason would work best, the next day she inquires of
Ser 
Osmund
 if his brother 
Osney
 could defeat Ser Boros in single combat. He replies that it wouldn't even be a
match, and wonders if Boros has commited treason. Cersei replies no, but thinks to herself: But Osney has.

Synopsis
Approaching the 
inn at the crossroads
, 
Brienne
's party encounters many corpses hanging from trees, each with a
chunk of rock salt in their mouths. They surmise that these were some of the men responsible for the 
raid on
Saltpans
, probably hanged by Lord 
Beric
's outlaw band. Reaching the inn, they meet four girls on the porch, and the
oldest addresses them. She asks for silver for a night's lodging, stating the only visitors they get are either sparrows
or robbers and worse. When Ser 
Hyle
 makes an inquiry regarding her tone, the smith approaches and Brienne is
nearly floored by his resemblance to 
Renly
. Inside, Brienne plans to leave before dawn with 
Podrick
 only, although
she is unsure where to go. At dinner, Septon 
Meribald
 leads a prayer, but 
Gendry
 does not participate and returns to
his forge. One of the orphan boys tells the septon that it is because he worships the 
Lord of Light
. Brienne delivers
some food to Gendry and mentions his resemblance to King 
Robert
, but they are interrupted by riders drawing near.
Gendry says they are friends, but when Brienne peeks out, she recognizes 
Biter
 among the seven men. The leader,
wearing the helm of 
Sandor Clegane
, threatens to kill 
Willow
 if she fires her crossbow. Brienne draws 
Oathkeeper
and intercedes. One of the men says that they are wounded and seek only fresh horses, for they are being chased by
outlaws. But the large man wearing the 
Hound
's helm charges Brienne, remembering her well. She makes short
work of him, running him through with Oathkeeper, and she whispers "Sapphires" as 
Rorge
 dies. But she is
blindsided by Biter, who tackles her to the ground. The huge cannibal smashes her in the face, breaking bones, and
then shatters her forearm. She hears the sounds of swords clashing in the background, but then Biter takes a bite out
of her face. Her last vision is Biter's tongue sticking out, obscenely long, almost like it were a sword...

Synopsis
Ser 
Jaime
 and Ser 
Brynden
 face each other across the drawbridge to 
Riverrun
, alone for a parley during the 
siege of
Riverrun
. The Blackfish is aware of the oath Jaime swore to 
Catelyn
, but the member of the 
Kingsguard
 makes it
known he does not have the 
Stark
 girls. He offers 
Edmure Tully
 in exchange for Lady 
Sybell Spicer
 and her
children, but Brynden refuses, telling him he swore to 
his king
 to keep 
his wife
 safe and won't hand her over to a
Frey noose. Jaime responds that the girl has been pardoned and no harm will come to her, nor anyone else if
Brynden yields Riverrun; they will be free to go or 
take the black
 as they choose, but Brynden dismisses the offer,
claiming that he and his men would rather die with swords in their hands than 
"be paraded through 
King's Landing
to die like 
Eddard Stark
"
. Brynden adds that he is well provisioned for a siege and the Lannister and Frey casualties
will be far higher than his own if they storm Riverrun.
The Blackfish also makes it clear that he believes Lord 
Tywin
 had a hand in the 
Red Wedding
, though that will
never absolve the 
Freys
 for their breach of the sacred laws of hospitality. Jaime challenges the older knight to single
combat, with each choosing a champion. When Brynden prods Jaime to face him himself, Jaime cannot help but rise
to the bait. But the Blackfish is not so foolish as to trust that Jaime's terms would be honored. The parley over, Jaime
rides back to his camp and calls his captains for a war council, resolved that he must break his vow to Lady Catelyn
and storm Riverrun.
The lords of the 
riverlands
 who have bent the knee to the 
Iron Throne
 do not tolerate the Freys' presence at the war
council. Ser 
Ryman
 is too drunk to attend, but 
Edwyn
 and 
Bastard Walder
 are present. When confronted by Lord
Clement Piper
 as to the condition of his son, Ser 
Marq
, Edwyn replies that he is still held at the 
Twins
 to ensure that
Pinkmaiden
 is truly loyal to the Iron Throne. When Bastard Walder and Lord Clement nearly come to blows when
Piper challenges Edwyn to a duel over a threat to Lord Clement's heir, Jaime silences them, ending the council
prematurely. Lord Clement storms out, and Lord Vance explains to Jaime that as well as his first born son, several of
Lord Clement's cousins and nephews accompanied Marq to the Twins, and are either captives or dead. When Edwyn
denounces them as traitors and rebels, Jaime coldly retorts that the Freys first rebelled against the Crown with Robb
Stark and then betrayed him, making them twice the traitors House Piper are. Jaime takes enjoyment out of watching
Edwyn's smug attitude evaporate at that remark.
Summoning Ser 
Ilyn Payne
 and Ser 
Lyle Crakehall
, Jaime heads straight for the Frey camp. He first has Payne cut
loose Edmure Tully, and when Edwyn and his father, Ser Ryman, come forth to protest, he warns them to keep
quiet. When Ryman persists, stating that he is the heir to the Crossing, Jaime punches him in the face with his
golden hand. He then dismisses Ryman back to the Twins, sick of the man's whoring and drinking, and takes the
bladed crown that his whore wears. When Jaime places Edwyn in charge of the Freys, Jaime witnesses a glimpse of
the contempt Edwyn feels for his own father. Jaime also demands that Lord 
Walder
 release all the hostages that he
has imprisoned at the Twins.
Jaime asks that Ser Ryman's singer accompany him back to his pavilion, and has his squires draw a bath for Edmure.
Jaime informs Edmure that he will be returned to Riverrun forthwith, and if he yields the castle, all will end well for
him.

The terms are that the 
smallfolk
 can stay and serve Lord 
Emmon Frey
, Ser Brynden will be permitted to take the
black along with any of the garrison who choose the same, and Edmure and his pregnant wife 
Roslin
 will be well-
treated prisoners at 
Casterly Rock
. If their child is a boy, Jaime says he will serve House Lannister as a page and
squire, and they will grant the boy some lands when he gets his knighthood. If it is a girl, the Lannisters will make
sure she has a good dowry when she is old enough to wed.
When Edmure asks what will happen should he refuse to yield, Ser Jaime indicates that he will assault Riverrun's
walls in waves, sending the ex-Tully bannermen first as fodder, then the Freys, and finally his cousin 
Daven
's
westermen, and he would demolish Riverrun and put all within its walls to the sword. As Jaime leaves the tent,
commanding 
Ryman's singer
 to play "
The Rains of Castamere
" for Edmure, the former Lord of Riverrun pleads,
"No. Not him. Get him away from me."

Synopsis
With 
Pycelle
 prostrate before her, 
Cersei
 accuses him of letting 
Gyles Rosby
 die, because she believes he is now
taking orders from 
Margaery
. The 
Grand Maester
 denies this, explaining that he visits the young queen to give her
sleeping potions, but 
Cersei
 knows otherwise. Forcing a confession from him that he also brings Margaery 
moon
tea
, she then commands him to announce that Lord Rosby's dying wish was to donate all his lands and incomes to
the Crown.
Lady 
Taena
 wonders how Margaery could be so foolish, but Cersei is too excited to care. She does realize that she
will need more proof in order to have Margaery executed for treason, knowing that she must arrange to have the girl
caught in the act. She asks Taena and her husband to bring the 
Blue Bard
 to dinner that night.
During the meal, Cersei demotes Ser 
Harys Swyft
 to Lord Treasurer, and with the position of 
Hand
 now vacant, she
offers the title to Lord 
Orton Merryweather
. Lord Orton accepts, although he is notably uncomfortable during the
dinner, particularly due to the presence of Margaery's favorite singer.
Cersei wastes little time moving on to the Blue Bard, accusing him of sleeping with Queen Margaery. The singer
denies it, despite Cersei smashing him in the face with his own lute, and even later in the black cells under
interrogation by 
Qyburn
. But the defrocked maester tortures the singer into submission, and they lead him to say
what they want. He accuses several others of also having carnal knowledge of Margaery, and then Cersei promises
that he will be allowed to take the black after he confesses in front of the court.
Later, Taena persuades Cersei to name 
Alla
 as innocent, since they may be able to use her to bear witness against
Margaery and her other cousins. At breakfast, 
Tommen
 mentions that Margaery will be at the Sept for 
Maiden's
Day
.
Cersei then launches the final move of her scheme, commanding Ser 
Osney
 to go before the High Septon and admit
his sins of "bedding" Margaery, 
Elinor
 and 
Megga
. The youngest Kettleblack agrees to do so, but states, "
The best
lies have some truth in 'em... to give 'em flavor, as it were
," so the Queen Regent then allows him to have his way
with her.

Alayne II
Synopsis
Arianne
 is imprisoned atop the 
Spear Tower
, contemplating her failed scheme. She never expected someone to
inform her father of the plan, nor for 
Hotah
 to intercept them, and certainly not 
Gerold Dayne
's unprovoked attack
on 
Myrcella
. Dayne escaped from Hotah's men, but he left a terrible scar on Myrcella's face, barely missing a
beheading stroke as was his apparent intent. Thinking her father would see her within a day, Arianne becomes
distraught as days turn into weeks, and although servants come and go with food, none will speak to her. She
considers who could have betrayed her, ponders her feelings at the loss of 
Ser Arys
, and thinks of her close
relationship with 
Tyene
. She eventually persuades the young serving girl 
Cedra
 to deliver a letter to Lord 
Fowler
,
knowing that the girl has feelings for 
Garin
 (who, Arianne assumes, is imprisoned at 
Ghaston Grey
 along with her
other co-conspirators). But the next day, Cedra does not return, and Arianne never sees her again during her
imprisonment.
After an indeterminate period of agonized waiting, Areo Hotah arrives to bring her before her father. Prince 
Doran
asks her why, to which Arianne replies, "For the honor of our 
House
." The Prince tells her they have not caught
Dayne, but the damage he did to Myrcella, a ward of their house, has done naught but bring the Martells dishonor.
He cautions her that a war with the 
Iron Throne
 is the last thing they need. Although the 
Young Dragon
 wrote that
Dorne
 was populous, his memoirs were written to portray himself in a better light. Prince Doran admits that Dorne is
actually the least populous of the 
Seven Kingdoms
, and could not survive open war with the Throne. He admits it
was a mistake not to have had her taken prior to running off with Myrcella, but he will not reveal who betrayed her.
When he tells her that she disappoints him, Arianne retorts, "You have been disappointing me for years, Father."
Prince Doran discloses that none of her co-conspirators are imprisoned. Instead, he has sent Ser 
Andrey Dalt
 to
Norvos
 to serve Arianne's mother; Garin is in 
Tyrosh
 for two years; and 
Sylva
 was sent to 
Greenstone
 to marry Lord
Eldon Estermont
. He goes on to remark that Arianne and her cousins may get the war they wanted, as Ser 
Balon
Swann
 is on his way to 
Sunspear
. The Prince has several of his bannermen stalling him, but eventually Ser Balon
will discover that his brother in the 
Kingsguard
, Ser 
Arys
, is dead and Myrcella maimed. Arianne continues to taunt
her father, and he cautions her that he is out of patience. But the princess is unimpressed, remarking, "For Lord
Tywin
 you always had the forbearance of 
Baelor the Blessed
, but for your own blood, none." He responds, "You
mistake patience for forbearance. I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of
Elia
 and her children."
When Arianne tells him that she wants her rights to Dorne, Prince Doran finally reveals that she will have the
kingdom when he passes. Arianne divulges that she knew of his scheme to make 
Quentyn
 his heir, but her father
tells her that he had other plans for her. He offered her hand to old men because he knew she would rebuke them,
but he had to be seen as trying. All along, he had promised her to Prince 
Viserys
, but now that the last male
Targaryen is dead, he has no reason to deny her her right to Dorne. He finishes by saying, "We princes make our
careful plans and the gods smash them all awry." His original plan was to send her to Tyrosh to serve as the
Archon's cupbearer, where she could meet her betrothed in secret, while her brother Quentyn was being raised to
assume the seat of their House. Finally he reveals why her brother is overseas: to bring back their heart's desire.
When Arianne asks what that is, her father replies, "Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood."

Brienne VIII
Synopsis
Alayne
 has been trying to coax a petulant Lord 
Robert
 to get dressed for the long descent to the 
Gates of the Moon
.
With winter fast approaching, the high seat of the 
Arryns
 will soon become inhospitable, and the entire staff is
retreating for the valley floor. Her "father" is away at the wedding of Lord 
Lyonel Corbray
, who supports the Lord
Protector along with several other Vale lords, including, just recently, Lord 
Benedar Belmore
. Maester 
Colemon
 is
concerned that Robert is being given 
Sweetsleep
 too often, as it is poisonous over time. However, he sees no other
way to get the boy down the mountain without a seizure. After riding the basket down to Sky, Alayne and the rest of
the household begin their descent on mules led by 
Mya Stone
. Accompanying them is Lady 
Myranda Royce
, Lord
Nestor
's daughter.
Randa is a natural gossip, and tells Alayne that Lady 
Waynwood
 and Ser 
Symond Templeton
 both showed at Lord
Corbray's wedding, and that 
Riverrun
 has yielded, but not 
Dragonstone
 or 
Storm's End
. Alayne is careful with her
words around the very clever Randa, although she stumbles when the woman mentions that Lord 
Eddard
's bastard
now commands the 
Night's Watch
. She thinks to herself it would be sweet to see her 
half-brother
 once more. Randa
discloses that 
Harry the Heir
 was recently knighted at a tourney, but Myranda doesn't like him because Lady
Waynwood denied Lord Nestor's attempt to marry Randa to Harry. She also lets on that he has a bastard daughter
despite his young age. Their banter turns to Mya and how her beloved Ser 
Mychel Redfort
 recently married one of
Lord 
Yohn
's daughters. Alayne reveals that Ser 
Lothor Brune
 likes Mya, but doesn't believe that the bastard
daughter of 
Robert Baratheon
 is aware.
After a rough stretch crossing a gorge, where Alayne has to carry a shaking Robert across, the party reaches the
Gates of the Moon. She discovers that her "father" has returned from the east, and she goes to see him immediately.
Lord 
Petyr
 is entertaining three hedge knights he recently hired for his household, one of whom is none other than
Ser 
Shadrich
 of the Shady Glen. Dismissing them, Petyr imparts word of 
Cersei
's spiraling downfall, saying, "It is
quite vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but... it
is a good thing that I thrive on chaos. What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three
queens, I fear." But he will not explain what he meant by "three" queens.
Petyr then announces that he has a present for her- a marriage contract to Harry the Heir. He tells her that she must
first win his approval before they are even betrothed, hopefully giving them enough time for 
Tyrion
 to perish,
allowing her to marry again. Lady Waynwood agreed to the proposal because despite Alayne's "low" birth, she is
nonetheless the daughter of the Lord Protector; not to mention that House Waynwood is heavily in debt (much of it
now owed to Littlefinger). When Alayne asks how the young knight could be Lady Anya's heir when she has three
sons, as well as daughters and grandsons, he tells her that Harry is actually Lord Robert's heir. He explains that Lord
Jon Arryn
's sister married a 
Waynwood
, and her only son perished at age three. But their youngest daughter married
a knight of 
House Hardyng
, who are landed knights sworn to 
Ironoaks
, and begot a son, now Ser Harrold Hardyng.
Besides Lord Robert, he is the only living male heir to the Arryns, since he is Lord Jon's great-nephew.
When Alayne learns this truth, she utters, "If Robert were to die..." To which Lord Petyr replies, "When Robert dies,
Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn's bannermen will
never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon... and when they come together

for his wedding, and you come out... clad in a maiden's cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the
back... why, every knight in the 
Vale
 will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright. So those are your gifts
from me, my sweet Sansa... Harry, the 
Eyrie
, and 
Winterfell
."

Synopsis
Brienne
 fluctuates between a fever dream and semi-consciousness, as the outlaws transport her severely injured
body to Lady 
Stoneheart
. While she is being treated by 
Jeyne Heddle
, Brienne learns that 
Biter
 is dead, skewered
through the head by a spear wielded by 
Gendry
. 
Lem
, now wearing 
Sandor
's steel dog helm, tells her that Stoneheart
wants her hanged for her "crimes". Brienne fully awakens in 
a cave
, where she meets 
Thoros of Myr
. The red priest
is a ghost of his former self, and he informs her about the current state of the former 
Brotherhood Without Banners
:
"Lord 
Beric
's fire has gone out of this world... A grimmer shadow leads us in his place... War makes monsters of us
all."
Before long, Brienne is brought before Lady Stoneheart, where she as well as 
Pod
 and Ser 
Hyle
 will be judged.
Brienne cannot see Stoneheart's face, but notices her holding a bronze crown ringed by iron swords. A northman,
most likely 
Harwin
, places 
Oathkeeper
 before Stoneheart, along with Brienne's writ signed by King 
Tommen
. The
outlaws see this as irrefutable proof that the Maid of Tarth is about 
Lannister
 business. Her words are wasted here,
as her pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears. Finally, Lady Stoneheart speaks, needing to place her hand over her
throat in order to gurgle out her judgment. Upon removing her hood, Brienne is horrified to discover that the
Hangwoman is actually Lady Catelyn Stark, albeit now a specter from the grave. Thoros reveals that it was Lord
Beric himself who administered the kiss of life to her, finally extinguishing his own unnatural life.
Stoneheart gives Brienne an ultimatum: kill Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 or be hanged. When the Maid states that she will
not make that choice, the thing that had been Catelyn Stark orders them hanged. Despite Ser Hyle's pleas for mercy,
and Podrick's stoicism, nooses are looped about all three of their necks. As they are hefted upward, thrashing and
dying, Brienne screams out a word...

Synopsis
Accompanied by six newly reinstated 
Warrior's Sons
, Septa 
Moelle
 brings word to the court that Queen 
Margaery
and her cousins have been imprisoned at the 
Great Sept of Baelor
 for adultery and high treason. The Septa reveals
that Margaery's maidenhead is not intact. Grand Maester 
Pycelle
 also reluctantly discloses to the Septa that
Margaery has had him mix 
moon tea
 on many occasions. Leaving the throne room confident that Margaery was
finished, 
Cersei
 agrees with 
Aurane Waters
' request to launch his new dromonds, in case Lord 
Mace Tyrell
 decides
to march on 
King's Landing
 to save his daughter. Lord 
Orton Merryweather
 remarks that the High Septon may want
to try Margaery himself, as the Faith used to do. Cersei hopes he is right.
Cersei has 
Tommen
 sign some blank warrants, which she then affixes names to. Summoning Ser 
Osfryd
, she orders
him to arrest Ser 
Tallad
, the 
Blue Bard
, 
Hugh Clifton
, 
Mark Mullendore
, as well as the 
Redwyne
 twins whom she
wants to be found innocent of the charges of bedding Margaery. The next morning, Cersei and 
Taena
 are carried by
litter to the Great Sept. On the way, Lady Merryweather inquires, "What if Margaery demands that her innocence be
determined by battle?" Cersei smiles, and replies that she must be championed by a knight of the 
Kingsguard
, but
since Ser 
Osmund
 is brother to one of her accusers, that leaves only Ser 
Meryn Trant
 and Ser 
Boros Blount
. Cersei
states that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes. Within the Sept, the High Septon grants Cersei
permission to visit her good-daughter, while Taena goes to speak with Margaery's cousins. Margaery is beside
herself, stripped of her clothes and dignity, while she is asked once an hour to confess her fornication. Cersei tells
her that she has rounded up all those that Ser Osney named, lying that they will reveal her innocence. When Cersei
says that a sworn brother of the Kingsguard will fight for her should it come to a trial by combat, Margaery demands
that her own brother, Ser 
Garlan the Gallant
, be summoned to fight in place of the grievously injured Ser 
Loras
.
Cersei would never allow this to happen; and Margaery, well aware of Cersei's intentions, tells her to leave, calling
her a vile, scheming, evil bitch.
Cersei is then escorted deep beneath 
Visenya's Hill
 to speak with the High Septon. He tells her that seven will sit in
judgment of Margaery and her cousins, as the Faith did in yore, before King 
Jaehaerys I Targaryen
 stripped them of
this power. When Cersei asks to have Ser Osney released into her custody, the priest flatly denies her. Chained to
the ceiling of his cell, Osney has been brutally whipped. Infuriated, Cersei tells the High Septon that Osney came of
his own free will. The holy man responds, "I have heard many men confess, but seldom have I heard a man so
pleased to be so guilty... The more diligently we applied the scourge, the more Ser Osney's offenses seemed to
change. He would now have us believe that he never touched Margaery Tyrell." When asked now if he had carnal
knowledge of the queen, Osney points at Cersei, saying, "Aye. That one there." Furthermore, he confesses that
Cersei ordered him to kill the old High Septon. Upon hearing this, Cersei bolts from the cell, racing headlong
through the Great Sept. Fearing what may happen should the Faith question Taena Merryweather, she is soon
overtaken by a group of septas, who strip her and confine her to a grim cell.
Her screams going unheard, Cersei begins to shiver from the cold. Every time she begins to fall asleep, she is jostled
awake and asked if she will confess her sins. After two days of this torture, 
Qyburn
 enters her cell. She begs him to
take her home, but the de-chained maester tells her it will not be allowed and she will be tried for murder, treason,
and fornication. He reveals that Margaery will be tried by the same court, and that he delivered the Blue Bard to the

High Septon, but despite the Faith's torture, "he is still singing the same sweet song we taught him". Qyburn then
informs her of the rapid changes made since her fall: the realm is now being governed by Ser 
Harys Swyft
 and
Pycelle; they removed Ser Osfryd as Commander of the gold cloaks and Qyburn from the small council (though he
still works for them thanks to his control of 
Varys
' whisperers); Lord Orton and Taena have fled to 
Longtable
, while
Ser 
Kevan
 has been sent for to take over the Regency. Perhaps worst of all, Aurane Waters unshipped his oars and
sailed the fleet, possibly to join Lord 
Stannis
; while Lord Mace Tyrell and Lord 
Randyll Tarly
 are marching on
King's Landing
.
Despite Qyburn's words that his unbeatable "champion" is ready, Cersei knows that only a Kingsguard can defend
her in a trial by combat. She has Qyburn pen her final plea to her brother: "Come at once. Help me. Save me. I need
you as I have never needed you before. I love you, I love you, I love you. Come at once."

Jaime I
Synopsis
Emmon Frey
, now Lord of 
Riverrun
 in fact as well as name, demands 
Edmure Tully
's head. Ser 
Jaime
 will not
accede, though he is sorely tempted since Edmure betrayed his concessions by helping his uncle, Ser 
Brynden
, to
escape the castle when he turned it over to the 
Lannisters
. Despite a massive search for Lord 
Hoster
's brother, Jaime
knows the Blackfish will not be found, nor will he abandon the fight. Before being escorted west to 
Casterly Rock
 as
a noble prisoner, Ser Edmure speaks his mind, "You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room,
Kingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you."
Later, Lady 
Sybell Westerling
 and her daughter, the widowed Queen 
Jeyne Stark
, are brought before Jaime. Jeyne is
in mourning for her husband and defiant to her mother, but when Sybell moves to slap her, Jaime intervenes and
kindly asks Jeyne to leave the solar. Jaime confirms to Lady Sybell that House Westerling has its pardon, her brother
has been named Lord of Castamere and marriages will be arranged for her daughters, though Jeyne will have to wait
two years before marrying again, to prevent rumours that any children she has are actually 
Robb Stark
's. Lady
Sybell asks Jaime to inquire after her son, Ser 
Raynald
, who accompanied Robb to 
the Twins
, and had no
knowledge of the arrangement between his mother and 
Tywin Lannister
. Jaime, suspecting that Raynald is likely
dead as Walder Frey also didn't know of the arrangement, agrees to inquire, promising that House Lannister will pay
his ransom if Raynald is held captive. She then mentions that Lord Tywin promised a high-born marriage for him,
"that Raynald should have joy of him". When Jaime states that 
Joy
 is his uncle 
Gerion
's natural daughter, Sybell
shouts, "You want a Westerling to marry a bastard?". Jaime, desiring to strangle the woman with her own necklace,
retorts "No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch. Your daughter is worth ten of
you, my lady. You'll leave with Edmure and Ser 
Forley
 on the morrow. Until then, you would do well to stay out of
my sight." He then contemplates how much Lord 
Gawen
 knew of his wife's schemes.
The following morning, Jaime warns Ser Forley Prester to guard Ser Edmure well, for fear either the Blackfish or
Beric Dondarrion
 might try to free him. The knight is aware of his orders to kill Edmure should he try to slip away.
Jaime adds that he should do the same for Jeyne Stark, stating that she is twice as dangerous as Edmure, should she
escape. Jaime then visits 
Edwyn Frey
, who is preparing his army to return to the Twins. Edwyn divulges that his
father, Ser 
Ryman
, along with his entire retinue, were hanged by Lady 
Stoneheart
 near 
Fairmarket
. Although Edwyn
blames Jaime, the Lord Commander is well aware that Edwyn couldn't care less that his father is dead. And although
Edwyn is now heir to the Twins, Jaime knows that 
Black Walder
 will probably soon move to kill his brother. Jaime's
only real concern is that the 
outlaws
 must be getting bolder if they are willing to kill Lord Walder's heir only a day's
ride from the Twins. Jaime takes his leave after inquiring about Ser Raynald's fate. Apparently, Queen Jeyne's
brother was responsible for loosing 
Grey Wind
 on the Freys, and was shot full of quarrels before diving into the
river. An offhand comment from Jaime about killing those responsible makes the Freys drop their smug attitude
about the act.
Content that he has taken 
Riverrun
 without having to take up arms against the 
Tullys
 or 
Starks
, Jaime later agrees to
allow Ser 
Desmond Grell
 and Ser 
Robin Ryger
 to 
take the black
, commanding 
Raff the Sweetling
 to escort them to
Maidenpool
. During Lord Emmon's speech to the people of Riverrun, Jaime speaks with the singer he took from
Ryman Frey earlier. He reveals himself as 
Tom of Sevenstreams
, and tells Jaime that he hopes to play for Lady

Genna
 and Lord Emmon over the winter. That night, Jaime dreams of his mother, Lady 
Joanna
, whom he barely
remembers, but the dream disturbs him when his mother cries and asks who he really is. In the morning, Maester
Vyman
 delivers 
Cersei
's message written by 
Qyburn
. The old maester asks if Jaime wishes to respond, but the
Kingsguard hands the letter to 
Peck
, saying, "No. Put this in the fire."

Synopsis
The 
Cinnamon Wind
 passes through the 
Redwyne Straits
 on her way to 
Oldtown
. Twice they evade and once drive
off 
longships
 of the 
ironmen
, before they reach their destination and undergo customs inspections. The ironborn now
control many of the outlying towns and fortifications surrounding the 
Arbor
 and along the 
Mander
 nearly to
Oldtown, having sacked 
Ryamsport
 and taken 
Vinetown
 and 
Starfish Harbor
. They have also been raiding ships in
the area. 
Sam
 learns that even Oldtown is at risk until Lord 
Paxter Redwyne
 can bring his fleet back from
Dragonstone
. Meanwhile, Lord 
Leyton Hightower
 has not left his tower in years, while his sons struggle to protect
the great city. His youngest son, Ser 
Humfrey
, has sailed to the 
Free Cities
 to hire sellsails or persuade his half-sister
Lynesse
 to loan him some of the Archon of Lys' ships. As Sam prepares to disembark for the 
Citadel
, he considers
whether it will be safe for 
Gilly
 at 
Horn Hill
, since it will only have a small regiment of guards left. Fortunately,
Sam knows that Gilly will be safe aboard the 
Cinnamon Wind
, at least until he can learn more of the situation in
Oldtown.
Upon reaching the 
Seneschal's Court
, Sam is forced to wait a long while before he will be admitted to speak with the
Seneschal
. His patience running thin at the delay, Sam is approached by 
Alleras
, who informs him that it will take a
penny to get past the acolyte. But when Alleras introduces himself, Sam is taken aback when he learns that the boy
is called "the Sphinx". Samwell then tells Alleras the story of how he reached Oldtown, leaving out only the secrets
he has sworn to keep. After hearing all that has transpired, especially Maester 
Aemon
's plea that the Citadel learn of
Daenerys
, Alleras tells him to forget the Seneschal. The archmaesters will believe little of what Sam has to say, but
there is one who will: Archmaester 
Marwyn
. At the 
Isle of Ravens
, Sam recognizes 
Leo Tyrell
, but before many
words can be exchanged, Marwyn the Mage appears and ushers Sam and Alleras into his chambers.
Marwyn first describes how the 
Valyrians
 used 
dragonglass
 for various magical means, noticing Sam's interest in the
Obsidian candle
. Sam then repeats what he told Alleras, stating that Maester Aemon was convinced that Daenerys
was the promised one in the prophecy, not Prince 
Rhaegar
 or 
Stannis
. To this, Archmaester Marwyn reveals how
fickle and treacherous prophecy can be, but he is still intrigued. He makes it clear to Sam that Maester Aemon may
have been killed by the archmaesters had he spoken his mind to them. When Sam inquires why, Marwyn replies,
"Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? The world the Citadel is building has no place in it
for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to
waste his life upon the 
Wall
, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He
could not be trusted. No more than I can."
Commanding Alleras to look after Sam, Marwyn makes known his plan to travel to 
Slaver's Bay
, as Maester Aemon
had intended. He intends to take the 
Cinnamon Wind
, hoping to reach Daenerys prior to the "grey sheep", as he calls
the other archmaesters. He advises Sam to work rapidly toward his chain, and to never mention anything of
prophecies, dragons, or Daenerys to anyone in the Citadel. Marwyn quickly departs, and Alleras reveals to Sam that
their meeting was not happenstance. The Mage knew Sam was coming, supposedly from the dragonglass candle.
The 
novice
 in the room the whole time shows Sam to his quarters, finally divulging his name, "I'm 
Pate
, like the pig
boy."

The 
skinchanger
 
Varamyr
, who has been injured during his flight from the 
battle beneath the Wall
, is plotting to take
over another body as he is dying.
Synopsis
The chapter begins from the perspective of a 
skinchanger
 in the body of a wolf. The 
warg
 leads a small pack on a
hunt. They hunt 
free folk
 fugitives and kill them.
After the kill the warg returns to his human body. He is 
Varamyr
 Sixskins and is seriously wounded. Like other free
folk, he had fled after 
their defeat
 at Castle Black. Varamyr burned when 
his eagle
 was killed and he lost his cloaks
and rings. After he robbed a dead woman of her cloak, her son stabbed him. His companion, Thistle, has sewn the
wound together but it is too serious and Varamyr knows he is dying.
He thinks back over his youth when he was still called Lump. As a youth he had slipped into one of his father's dogs.
The dogs killed 
Bump
, his little brother, and Varamyr remembers his brother looking at him and knowing. Because
his father did not know which dog had killed Bump, he killed them all. When the last dog was killed, Lump - who
was in him - screamed, which made his father understand his son's ability. His parents then brought Lump to
Haggon
, another skinchanger. Haggon raised Lump and taught him about skinchangers, although Lump did not
adopt his morals, particularly regarding what Haggon describes as abominations: eating the flesh of man while
inside an animal, mating with a beast while inside one, and seizing the body of a human. When Haggon died,
Varamyr drove him out of his wolf 
Greyskin
 to claim the wolf for himself.
Later Varamyr adopted more animals and became Varamyr Sixskins. He established himself as a kind of lord, taking
tribute in food and using his animals to bring him women from nearby villages.
Varamyr wakes up from his memories when Thistle returns. As he knows that his body is dying, he turns on his
companion to take over her body. She struggles and eventually manages to escape his control. As he dies, he half
regrets trying to take over Thistle's body, but also half regrets failing at that. He awakens in the body of one of his
wolves. Later his pack discovers Thistle. Frozen blood clings to her - she has become a 
wight
. As her blue eyes stare
into his wolf eyes he knows she sees him ...

Lannisters
 and murder of 
his father
, as well as his anxiety over the fate of 
Tysha

knows to be the only woman ever to have truly loved him.
Having escaped and found passage across the sea thanks to 
Varys

he would prefer to go to 
Dorne

Magister
 
Illyrio

Tyrion spends a day wandering around Illyrio's home talking to his servants and plotting escape. He discovers 
a
patch of poisonous mushrooms
 and picks them before passing out. He meets a courtesan of Illyrio's who has been
assigned to him, threatening her before heading off to dinner with the Magister.
He is eventually served a dish of mushrooms and contemplates whether Illyrio is trying to poison him, and whether
it would not be best just to eat some and be done with it. Illyrio goads him before eating some of the mushrooms
himself and asking Tyrion of his intentions. He informs Tyrion that 
Stannis
 is at the 
Wall
, and says that neither
Stannis at the Wall nor Myrcella in Dorne is a viable candidate for support in the game of thrones. Mopatis claims
that Westeros is in need of a savior from across the sea. When Tyrion asks who that would be, he replies "
A dragon
with three heads
".

her with a terrible
Synopsis
Daenerys Targaryen
, now riling 
Meereen
 as its Queen, is presented the body of 
Stalwart Shield
, one of her 
Unsullied
soldiers. Stalwart Shield was killed by the 
Sons of the Harpy
 when he was visiting a brothel. He was found with the
genitals of a goat stuffed down his throat, and with his sword missing. Daenerys notes that, although the Harpy's
Sons have killed to freedmen loyal to her before, Stalwart is the first of her soldiers to be killed. Ser 
Barristan
Selmy
, 
Lord Commander of her Queensguard
, warns her that Stalwart will not be the last. Daenerys offers a reward
for anyone who can return the missing sword, and orders her men to investigate who has been gelding goats
recently. Barristan informs her that the Unsullied are ill-suited to find the murderers, but Daenerys sees them as her
only option, as the 
Dothraki
, who would fare far worse, are gone from the city, attempting to subdue the hinterlands,
as are her 
Second Sons
 and 
Stormcrows
, the former gone south to guard Meereen against possible attacks from
Yunkai
, the latter to the east to make an alliance with the 
Lhazareen
.
From the terrace of her private chambers in the 
Great Pyramid
, Daenerys looks out over the city as dawn breaks. Her
dragon 
Viserion
 looks at her as she walks by, and takes off into the sky as Daenerys watches him go. She notes that
her dragons have been growing larger and wilder, and wonders if she has left them too much to themselves. She
thinks they are almost large enough to ride.
When Viserion is out of sight, she returns to her chambers and dons a 
tokar
. On her way to hold court, she is met by
Reznak mo Reznak
, her 
seneschal
, and 
Skahaz mo Kandaq
. They have heard what happened to Stalwart Shield.
Skahaz, a Meereenese nobleman who has "put the old Meereen behind him to accept the new", symbolized by him
shaving his head, thereby exchanging the customary Meereenese hair styles for a bald head. He and his followers,
"the shavepates", are regarded as enemies by the Harpy's Sons. Skahaz is convinced that the noble Meereenese slave
families are behind the attack, and suggests killing one man of each family now, and two of each of these families
the next time one of her soldiers is killed. Reznak is horrified by the suggestion, and insists that the murderer will
prove to be baseborn. Daenerys orders them to increase the reward offered for a Harpy's Son, and leaves to hold
court.
The first petitioner is the 
Astapori
 envoy, Lord 
Ghael
. He presents Daenerys with a present from 
Astapor
's new king,
Cleon
. Ghael has asked Daenerys for her hand in marriage in Cleon's name several times before, but today he
proposes Astapor and Meereen form an alliance against 
Yunkai
. Daenerys regrets having left Yunkai untaken, as the
Yellow City had resumed to slavery as soon as she had moved on. However, she also finds that Cleon is little better
than the Yunkai'i, as he has enslaved the former slave masters. She suggests to the ambassador that King Cleon
should feed the people in his starving city before sending them out into war.
The next petitioner is 
Hizdahr zo Loraq
, a wealthy Meereenese noble. For the sixth time, Daenerys refuses to grant
him his wish of opening the fighting pits of 
Meereen
. Daenerys recalls that Reznak and the 
Green Grace
 have been

urging her to take a Meereenese noble for her husband in order to reconcile the city to her rule. Daenerys thinks that
Hizdahr might be an option. She recalls how Skahaz had offered to wed her, expressing willingness to set aside his
wife to do so. However, Daenerys does not like the notion.
Several other petitioners follow, many of them presenting Daenerys with grievances about deeds done during the
sack of the city. A young boy tells her how two of his father's houseshold slaves had killed his father and older
brother, and raped and killed his mother. He request they be hanged, but Daenerys has to deny him, as she had
declared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack, and will not punish slaves for rising up against
their masters. The boy attempts to attack her upon hearing her decision, but fails when he trips on his own tokar.
Daenerys forgives him and sends him away, but as he leaves she sadly thinks to herself that the Harpy has just
gained another Son.
The day at court ends with petitions made by shepherds claiming that her dragons have devoured their animals;
Some have even brought burned bones as proof. Although she is convinced that some of the claims are false,
Daenerys orders Reznak to pay they for the animals they have lost. The petitioners are all sent away, but one man
stays behind. As Daenerys asks him what he wants from them, he empties a sack of burnt bones on the floor. Reznak
angrily berates him, telling him the compensations for the losses are to be collected the next morning, but Barristan
quickly speaks up while Daenerys comes to the same realization. They are not the bones of a sheep. They belong to
a child.

Synopsis
In 
Jon
's dream he sees through the eyes of his direwolf, 
Ghost
, who is hunting in the woods somewhere south of the
Wall. In the dream Ghost is aware of the presence of the other stark direwolves 
Nymeria
, 
Shaggydog
 and 
Summer
.
Jon is awakened from the dream by 
Jeor Mormont
's raven. He resides in the old quarters of 
Donal Noye
, since
Stannis
 occupies the King’s Tower and the Lord Commander’s Tower has burned down. He reflects that Ghost
knows that 
Grey Wind
 is dead, but his other brothers' wolves are still alive. His wolf dreams are becoming more
vivid and more frequent, and he wonders if part of 
Bran
 and 
Rickon
 survive in their wolves.
As 
Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
, Jon heads off to treat with King Stannis, who has requested his presence.
As Jon crosses the yard, he gives advice to sparring recruits and is challenged to a duel by Ser 
Godry Farring
, from
Stannis’ retinue, but ignores the challenge. On the steps up, he runs into 
Sam
 before finally arriving at the King's
Tower.
Stannis has been unsuccessful in seeking allegiance from the lords of the North; the latest rejection letter is from
Lyanna Mormont
. So far, the only house to have declared for him is 
House Karstark
. Stannis asks for gold from the
Night's Watch to pay off 
Salladhor Saan
. Jon recommends he take 
White Harbor
 for that, but Stannis dismisses its
lord, 
Wyman Manderly
, as fat and useless. With 
wildling
 refugees still seeking shelter south of the wall, they
discuss 
Mance Rayder
, whom Stannis intends to burn as a deserter, his wife's sister 
Val
, and his child. Jon mentions
that 
Gilly
 is acting as wet nurse for her own child and Mance's, and that he plans to send her and her babe away
south. Stannis approves once he learns that Gilly's child was born of incest.
Stannis is demanding lands and castles from the Night's Watch. Jon has already ceded land in The Gift, and refuses
to let him have the castles. He offers instead to have his own officers man the abandoned forts, to command Stannis'
men as a garrison. Stannis grumbles and threatens Jon before allowing him to leave. 
Melisandre
, the priestess of
R'hllor
, follows Jon out from the meeting. Jon is wary of her but she warns him not to refuse her friendship, saying
that she has seen him in her visions. Underneath the Wall, she tells him to be wary of foes behind his back and
daggers in the dark. Jon assures her he is aware he has enemies in the Watch, to which Melisandre replies 
"You
know nothing, Jon Snow"

Synopsis
Bran
 is making his way through the 
haunted forest
, in search of the 
three-eyed crow
, accompanied by the Reeds,
Hodor
, and 
Coldhands
. Bran skinchanges into 
Summer
 frequently, and even into Hodor, although Hodor seems to
dislike the experience. Coldhands is riding on an elk and is accompanied by ravens. 
Jojen
 is becoming ill and weak.
Coldhands stops to deal with "foes" he refuses to name, backtracking while the others continue on. 
Meera
 points out
that they have never seen Coldhand's breath even in the icy weather - and he does not eat, or drink, or sleep. Bran
points out that Coldhands saved Sam and Gilly from 
wights
, so they must trust him.
Bran enters Summer in order to find an abandoned wildling village for shelter. As they rest, Jojen refuses to eat
despite his weakness, telling his sister that this is not the day he dies. All four of them are near starving, but they
refrain from lighting a fire at Coldhand's instruction.
Sleepless, Bran enters Summer on the hunt, who has found the corpses of five men - and the wolf pack that found
them first. Summer/Bran squares off for a fight against 
the leader
 of the pack, seeing in his eyes that he is in fact 
a
warg
 like him. Bran/Summer defeats the pack leader, making the pack his and giving him the choice parts of the
dead men. The dead men are in black - men of the 
Night's Watch
.
Bran awakens to a fire - Coldhands has killed a pig for them, and as the dawn is near he allows them to light a fire to
roast it. Bran asks Coldhands, who fears the flames, what happened to the foes. Coldhands replies that they will not
trouble him - he does not deny that they are dead at his hand. Only Jojen pays attention when Bran asks 
who they
were
 - but he already knows they were men of the Night's Watch. Bran asks the ranger about his black hands, and he
tells Bran that the blood runs into a man's extremities and congeals once he is dead. Meera demands to see his face,
which he refuses. Bran notes that he could not pass beyond the Wall and its enchantments.
Meera asks who the three-eyed crow is and he replies 
"A friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will. The last
greenseer
"
. Meera asks Jojen if he has dreamed this and he says they have come too far to go back now.

Synopsis
Tyrion
 has been smuggled out of 
Pentos
 inside the litter of 
Illyrio Mopatis
, and they are now on their way to the
Rhoyne
. Illyrio explains that Tyrion and a sellsword called 
Griff
 will meet 
Daenerys
 in 
Volantis
, while he remains
to "smooth the way" for them in Pentos. Illyrio tells Tyrion that Daenerys has need of cunning men such as him, but
Tyrion is suspicious: why does Illyrio have a stake in helping Daenerys claim the 
Iron Throne
? Instead of
answering, the merchant tells of how when he first met her, Daenerys was young and fearful and her brother 
Viserys
was foolish and greedy, and Mopatis had to post guards on her door to prevent her brother from "undoing years of
planning" by entering her chambers and raping her before she was given to Khal 
Drogo
. He recounts how the meek
little girl he knew was reborn in the Dothraki sea as a true Targaryen, before turning to Slaver's Bay, conquering
Astapor
, cowing 
Yunkai
 and sacking 
Meereen
. He now expects her to make her way to Volantis - where she will
meet Tyrion and Griff with enough forces to carry her to 
Westeros
.
Tyrion presses Illyrio, wanting to know why a slaver city like Volantis and a man such as Illyrio would want to
assist Daenerys, and he says that her brother promised him the position of 
Master of Coin
 and the castle of his
choice. Tyrion also demands to know how he is friends with 
Varys
, and Illyrio tells him that the two of them were
thieves together in Pentos - with Varys spying on and stealing from other thieves, then passing them on to Illyrio,
who would return the goods to their rightful owners for a fee. Varys trained a network of spies - young boys and
girls - to steal information, and eventually the two of them became influential enough that Illyrio was able to marry
the daughter of the cousin of the Prince of Pentos, and Varys was sought by 
Aerys the Mad
 in his paranoia for the
post of 
Master of Whisperers
.
Over several more days' travel through 
Andalos
, Illyrio tells Tyrion that he has managed to persuade the 
Golden
Company
 to break their contract with 
Myr
 and instead accompany Daenerys. When Tyrion questions how Illyrio
convinced the Golden Company- a group that has spent most of its history warring with the Targaryens- to side with
Daenerys, the magister reminds Tyrion that the 
Blackfyre Pretenders
 are no more and that Daenerys can give the
company of exiles what the Blackfyres never could: she can finally take them home. After Tyrion recounts the story
of 
Hugor of the Hill
, he tells Illyrio that he had originally intended to become 
High Septon
 before he met and
married 
Tysha
. Illyrio likewise has a story of a 
Lysene
 bed slave, Serra, his second wife, who was killed by the 
grey
plague
. As they continue to travel, Tyrion's thoughts turn to 
Shae
, and to Tysha.

The Windblown
Synopsis
Quentyn Martell
, son of the 
Prince of Dorne
, is in 
Volantis
, disguised as a wineseller's servant. He and his servant
are attempting to book a passage to 
Meereen
 aboard ship, but even in the massive port of Volantis they are unable to
find a single ship willing to risk the trip to 
Slaver's Bay
 while there is war brewing and the 
slave trade
 and 
fighting
pits
 are both terminated.
Quentyn is accompanied by 
Gerris Drinkwater
, acting as his merchant master, and 
Archibald Yronwood
. On the trip
from 
Dorne
 aboard the 
Meadowlark
 they were attacked by corsairs from the 
Disputed Lands
, losing their Maester
Kedry
, 
Willam Wells
 and his dear friend 
Cletus Yronwood
. Quentyn feels their loss keenly, and feels in dire need of
his missing maester's counsel.
Quentyn and Gerris meet with the captain of the 
Adventure
, a smuggler's ship, who agrees to take them to Meereen
only if they are prepared to pay three times the normal fare - for each of them. Quentyn knows that the man simply
plans to take their money and either kill them or enslave them at the first chance he gets.
The pair debate whether they should give up their quest and return to Dorne, or attempt to travel to Meereen
overland via the 
demon road
. Quentyn is anxious not to have any more deaths on his conscience, but he feels his
duty to Dorne and to his father is too important to turn back. They travel through the streets to the 
Merchant's House
to meet with Archibald Yronwood. Along the way, they encounter a party of 
Windblown
 who are recruiting soldiers
as they head to 
Yunkai
 to war against 
Astapor
 and 
Meereen
. Quentyn tells him that they have no choice but to board
Adventure
 - but Archibald says there is another way to Meereen, less honorable, but faster than the demon road...

Jon III
This chapter covers the events of 
Chapter 5 of 
A Feast for Crows
, but from 
Jon's
 perspective rather than 
Samwell
Tarly
's.
Synopsis
Jon summons Gilly and, despite his own misgivings, forces her to give up her own child and take 
Mance Rayder
's
baby away with her, disguised as her own. Gilly is distraught, but Jon tells her that 
Melisandre
 will burn the child
for the purposes of a spell, as Mance was 
King-Beyond-The-Wall
 and the blood of kings has magical powers. Jon
warns her that if Mance's son is burned her own will die as well. She leaves wordlessly.
Soon after, Sam arrives. After a brief discussion regarding what they know of 
the Others
 and how to stop such
monsters, Jon breaks the news that he is sending Sam to the 
Citadel
 so he can train to become a maester and replace
Maester 
Aemon
. Sam will travel by sea from 
Eastwatch
, along with Gilly, the baby, and Maester Aemon. Sam
leaves him, distraught, while Jon remembers something Maester Aemon told him when he became Lord
Commander of the Night's Watch:
You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be
done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.
Jon makes his inspection of Castle Black, during which he hears a report from 
Dywen
 and 
Kedge Whiteye
 that two
of the 
queen's men
, Ser 
Richard Horpe
 and Ser 
Justin Massey
, were seen riding off to the south.
The next morning, Jon wakes early to see off Sam, Gilly, and Maester Aemon, as they depart for Eastwatch. He then
meets with ranger 
Bedwyck
. Jon tells Bedwyck that he is putting a garrison in the abandoned way-castle 
Icemark
and giving him command of it. Both of them assert the danger of wildlings climbing over and creating a toehold for
the rest, referring to 
Raymun Redbeard
 having done just that to bypass the wall. Jon says he is intending to garrison
all of the castles on 
the Wall
, but for the time being, only Icemark and Greyguard. When he learns that 
Janos Slynt
 is
to command Greyguard, Bedwyck urges Jon to choose someone more trustworthy.
Half the morning passes before Lord Janos reports as commanded, escorted by 
Kegs
 and 
Dolorous Edd
. Jon tells
him that he is giving him command of 
Greyguard
 (partly in light of Slynt's years commanding the City Watch, but
primarily to separate Slynt from 
Alliser Thorne
 and end their scheming), but Slynt curses him and storms out. The
next morning, Jon finds Slynt breaking his fast in the common room and announces that he is giving Slynt one last
chance to drop his spoon and report to the stables to depart for Greyguard. After Slynt refuses him again and mocks
him in front of his men and Stannis' men, Jon instructs 
Iron Emmett
 and Edd to take Slynt to the Wall and hang him.
As Slynt is being dragged out, Jon changes his mind and orders a block brought so he can behead Slynt himself with
Longclaw
. With his head on the block, Slynt desperately begs Jon for mercy. Jon refuses and carries out the
execution. Watching from the steps of the 
King's Tower
, Stannis meets Jon's eyes and nods briefly in approval.

 Halfmaester and Ser 
Rolly
Duckfield
, who take on supplies from 
Illyrio
 before leaving with Tyrion. Illyrio tells them the dwarf's name is Yollo,
although Tyrion, misliking the name, claims it is his name in 
Pentos
 and his name is Hugor Hill. The pair tease
Tyrion with tales of river 
pirates
 and the 
Shrouded Lord
. Tyrion and Haldon test each others' book knowledge while
Duck recounts the events that led to his knighting at the hands of 
Griff
 and his unusual name. They ride until they

asks "What if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of dragons was just some sailor's drunken fancy?
This wide world is full of such mad tales. Grumkins and snarks, ghosts and ghouls, mermaids, rock goblins, winged
horses, winged pigs...winged lions." Griff tells him to guard his tongue or lose it.

Synopsis
In the middle of a storm, 
Davos
 is marched before 
Godric Borrell
, Lord of 
Sweetsister
, in his castle 
Breakwater
 at
Sisterton
. He was captured by Borrell's men while trying to find passage off the island to 
White Harbor
. 
Salladhor
Saan
's fleet had been smashed by storms since heading south from the 
Wall
, until Saan, frustrated by 
Stannis
Baratheon
's continual inability to make good on his promises, abandoned his cause, leaving his old friend Davos on
Sweetsister after Davos refused to journey south with him. Davos conceals this fact from Borrell, telling him that
Saan has traveled south to raid the Lannisters at Stannis' command. Borell informs Davos that 
Lysa Arryn
 is dead -
and 
Tywin Lannister
, at the hand of 
his dwarf son
. We also learn that a shipload of 
Freys
 have reached White
Harbor, with its Lord, 
Wyman Manderly
 of White Harbor having pledged his allegiance to 
King Tommen
. The news
dismays Davos, but he hides his reaction and asks Borrell to help him get to White Harbor.
Borrell tells of his meeting with 
Eddard Stark
 during 
Robert's Rebellion
. Ned was attempting to reach 
Winterfell
 so
he could call his banners and join Robert's Rebellion, while avoiding 
Gulltown
, which was loyal to 
the Mad King
.
Stark had arrived at the 
Three Sisters
 after crossing the mountains to the Fingers, where he convinced a fisherman to
carry him to White Harbor. The fisherman drowned during passage, but the fisherman's daughter got Ned to The
Sisters. Lord Godric asserts that Ned left her with a bag of silver and a bastard son, whom she named 
Jon Snow
,
after Arryn. Borrell's father decided to let Ned go on his way instead of turning him over to the 
Targaryens
 after
telling Ned "If you lose, you were never here".
Borrell decides to let Davos go on his way instead of turning him in, just as his father did to Ned Stark. Davos echos
the sentiments expressed by Ned Stark and agrees to deny his presence in Sweetsister if Stannis winds up on the
losing side of the conflict.

Synopsis
At 
Castle Black
 
Melisandre
 is preparing to burn 
Mance Rayder
 in a cage made out of wood from the 
haunted forest
,
despite 
Jon
's pleas to King 
Stannis
 to spare him. At the sight of the cage, Mance's courage fails and he goes to his
death begging for mercy, denying his kingship and his name and shrieking of witchcraft. Melisandre burns the 
Horn
of Joramun
 as well, so that the Wall can never fall. As the cage burns Jon orders his bowmen to shoot Mance with
arrows, a fitting end for a man of the 
Night's Watch
. Melisandre proclaims to the assembled 
wildlings
 that Stannis is
their true King, 
Azor Ahai
 reborn. Stannis draws 
Lightbringer
 which is blindingly bright, and promises all who
serve him food, land and justice. The gates of the 
Wall
 are opened and most of the captive wildlings enter to kneel
before Stannis, feeding the fire with fragments of 
weirwood
, pieces of the 
old gods
 to feed 
R'hllor
's fires.
Bowen Marsh
 thinks it is wrong to let thousands of wildlings south of the Wall, and would prefer to seal the gates
and let the wildlings defend the northern side. Many of the men of the Night's Watch are also muttering against the
perception that Jon has taken Stannis' side in the game of thrones. Jon denies this, but says that the outcome of the
struggle is unclear following the death of 
Tywin Lannister
. Jon shares a cup of wine with 
Clydas
, telling him that
Maester 
Aemon
 had shown him a passage in the 
Jade Compendium
 describing 
Lightbringer
 as both bright and
fearfully hot. He notes that although Stannis's sword radiates light, it produces no heat.

Synopsis
There have been more murders by the 
Harpy's Sons
 on the streets of 
Meereen
. This time they involved an attack on
fully-armed 
Unsullied
 in pairs. Nine died, including one of 
Missandei
's brothers, 
Mossador
. Once again, 
Daenerys
orders an investigation, permitting 
Skahaz mo Kandaq
 to torture a wineseller when she discovers that three
freedmen
 were among the slain. Furious, Dany orders the Unsullied to restrict themselves to patrolling the walls,
and imposes a blood tax on the great families of Meereen to fund a new mixed force of freedmen and 
shavepates
 to
patrol the city streets under the control of Skahaz. The families of 
Zhak
 and 
Merreq
 are preparing to leave the city;
the Queen orders that their wealth must remain behind, as well as some of their children in her custody.
That night, Dany offers Missandei the chance to return to 
Naath
, but the girl feels safer with her. Dreaming of
Daario Naharis
, Dany hopes that the sellsword will remain loyal to her. Dany goes to take a bath on her terrace,
when she is surprised by the voice of 
Quaithe
, speaking to her via some magic. "Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The
glass candles
 are burning. Soon comes the 
pale mare
, and after her the others. 
Kraken
 and dark flame, 
lion
 and
griffin, the 
sun's son
 and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the 
Undying
. Beware the 
perfumed
seneschal
." After telling her to remember who she is, Quaithe is gone. As the sun rises, Dany breaks her fast and
prepares for court.
At court she gazes suspiciously at 
Reznak mo Reznak
 - could he be a traitor? 
Hizdahr zo Loraq
 pleads for the
seventh time for the reopening of the fighting pits, this time cunningly presenting former fighters who themselves
willingly ask to be returned to combat. She promises to consider all they have said and then ends the session.
Barristan Selmy
 relates how he escaped from 
King's Landing
 and 
Joffrey
's guards, and defends 
Eddard Stark
 when
Daenerys angrily denounces him as a traitor, asserting that Stark argued against having her killed in the 
small
council
. Dany asks to see her dragons: 
Rhaegal
 and 
Viserion
 have been chained up in a pit since the killing of the
little girl 
Hazzea
, but 
Drogon
 could not be taken and was last seen flying off north to the

 and

 enter a cell in the dungeons of the

foul-smelling man, who knows his name is 
Reek
 - but that he once had another name.
Reek is so weakened and mentally ravaged that he is terrified of the two eight year old Freys. He remembers his
attempt to escape with the bedwarmer 
Kyra
, but that had been a ruse by 
Ramsay Bolton
 for his own amusement.
Kyra had suffered horribly at the hands of Ramsay's dogs, and Reek has lost several of his own fingers and toes
through agonizing flayings at the hands of the 
Bastard's Boys
.
The Frey boys bring Reek before Ramsay, who is with

Coldhands
 has brought

,

, 
Meera
 and 
Summer
 to a steep snow-covered hill. When his elk died,
Coldhands butchered it for food, but all the steaks are gone now and they are all weak from hunger and cold,
particularly Jojen.
They have to make their way up the hill into a cleft - about a thousand yards through thick wood. But the 
Others
 are
close by - Coldhand and his ravens can sense them, and an unnatural cold has descended, even as they remain
unseen. The ravens urge Bran on so they start up the hill. Meera has to support Jojen's weight.
Around eighty yards from the 
cave
 entrance, Summer stops at a steep stretch of unbroken snow. Bran, on Hodor's
back, knows something is wrong. Coldhands continues to climb so Hodor follows him. He glimpses a fire in the
cave entrance when suddenly Hodor trips and falls. A 
wight
 bursts from the snow, grasping his leg. Bran falls from
his basket as Hodor and the wight struggle, and soon he is surrounded by dead men emerging from under the snow
with pale flesh and black hands. Wights attack Coldhands as well, and Bran is grabbed as he tries to warn Jojen and
Meera further down the slope. Summer tears off the arm and throat of the wight assaulting Bran and he begins to
crawl the 50 yards to the cave.
Bran enters the mind of Hodor to help him fight off the wights. Meera reaches him as he waves her up the hill and
grabs Jojen. Someone sets the wights on fire. Bran awakens in the cave before a 
child of the forest
. She takes them
down into the cave, but Coldhands cannot follow them due to the ward on the cave against dead things. They go
deeper, underneath roots and across a floor of bones, till they reach a skeletal body sitting on a throne made of roots
- the 
three-eyed crow

Synopsis
Daenerys
 is hosting 
Xaro Xhoan Daxos
, the 
Qartheen
 merchant. After viewing a dance by his naked male and
female slaves, they discuss Dany's situation since she left Qarth. Xaro is aware of the activities of the 
Sons of the
Harpy
 and flatteringly tells Daenerys that he fears for her safety. He scoffs at her attempts to abolish slavery in
Meereen and tells her that the 
Thirteen
 are willing to trade with the city - in slaves. He offers her thirteen galleys if
she leaves for 
Westeros
 immediately. Dany tells him she will have her men inspect the ships, and refuses his feigned
advances to her.
She also learns from Xaro Xhoan Daxos that 
Pyat Pree
 and three other

Pentos
 soon after she left
that city.
The next day at court, she refuses the desperate pleas of

When she summons Xaro to tell him, his obsequiousness vanishes. He tells her she will die screaming and that he
should have killed her in Qarth. She has him thrown out of the palace, but the next day an emissary gives her a
bloody glove - the Qartheen have declared war.

Jon V
Synopsis
During an inspection of the stores, 
Jon
 is informed by 
Bowen Marsh
 and some other stewards that there is not
enough to feed the 
Night's Watch
, the 
wildlings
, and 
Stannis
' men through the winter. He grimly orders a cut in
rations, though he knows it will make him unpopular, and tells Marsh they will find a way to feed everyone.
He is then summoned to meet with Stannis. 
Rattleshirt
 taunts Jon, offering to sing for him and pointing out the red
ruby on his iron cuff, and Stannis tells Jon that he is handing the wildling to Jon. Despite his reluctance to be seen as
partial to Stannis in the War of Five Kings, he advises him of the ways of the northern lords and offers him advice
over how to win them over. He ignores the provocations of the 
Queen's Men
 as Stannis tells him that he plans to
leave the Wall and take on 
Ramsay Bolton
 at the 
Dreadfort
 unawares.
Arnolf Karstark
 has been urging Stannis to
attack the Dreadfort claiming that it is lightly garrisoned.
Jon bluntly tells him that his plan will fail, earning more scorn from the Queen's Men. Stannis silences them and
orders Jon to explain his reasons. Jon explains several things; firstly, unless Stannis wins 
Mors Umber
 (who is
offering an alliance in exchange for certain conditions, namely the skull of 
Mance Rayder
 and a pardon for his
brother 
Hother Umber
, who is fighting under duress for the Boltons) to his cause, Umber will cut Stannis's host to
pieces as it crosses his land. Second, the Dreadfort will learn of Stannis's coming long before his arrival and Jon,
having seen the castle's defences, knows that a small garrison could hold the Dreadfort against many times their
number. Thirdly, with the imminent fall of 
Moat Cailin
 to 
House Bolton
, the combined armies of Ramsay and 
Roose
Bolton
 will outnumber Stannis 5 to 1, and will easily destroy him as he lays siege to the Dreadfort. In addition, the
northern lords Stannis seeks to rally to his cause, who have suffered generations of wildings raiding their holdings,
will not be pleased to see his wildling conscripts crossing their lands.
Stannis orders everyone out of the room except Melisandre and Jon. Stannis again offers 
Winterfell
 to Jon, but Jon
reminds him that Sansa is currently the rightful heir and that he cannot forsake his vows. Stannis says he plans to
give Winterfell to 
Arnolf Karstark
, and Jon rebuts that the Karstarks abandoned his brother 
Robb Stark
. Robb had
personally beheaded Lord 
Rickard Karstark
 after the latter killed two of Stark's prisoners. Jon promises a source of
more men to Stannis, if Stannis will let him keep the wildlings to occupy more of the forts at the Wall. Stannis
agrees and Jon tells him of the petty lords of the mountains - 
House Flint
, 
House Wull
, 
House Norrey
, and 
House
Liddle
. Jon counsels Stannis to march through the mountains, win the mountain clans to his side, then emerge to
attack 
Deepwood Motte
 and defeat the Ironmen to rouse the north to his side. Stannis agrees that it is a plan likely to
succeed and impress the northmen. Jon also warns that the clansmen are deeply devout to the 
old gods
, warning
Melisandre that her presence won't be welcome. Melisandre surprises Jon by telling him she will stay at the Wall.
He ruefully reflects on how he has acquired a thousand wildlings whom he cannot feed.

Synopsis
Tyrion
 and his companions aboard the

 continue their way down the 
Rhoyne
. As they encounter heavy
amounts of fog in the 
Sorrows
, severely hindering their visibility, 
Ysilla
 insists that it is 
not a common fog
, claiming
that restless spirits surround them.
Tyrion is initially unconcerned and begins to make japes, but he quickly begins to re-evaluate the situation as the
surroundings grow more and more eerie. The 
Shy Maid
 floats past the ruins of a palace in the ruins of 
Chroyane
, and
Tyrion recalls to himself the brief joy he once had with 
Tysha
.
Fearing an attack from the fog, Griff orders Young Griff to accompany Septa 
Lemore
 to safety below deck. Tyrion
reveals his knowledge regarding the boy, and confirms bits of information he apparently learned from his previous
bet with 
Haldon
. Young Griff is in fact young 
Aegon Targaryen
, although Tyrion is uncertain how he survived the
events following the 
Trident
. He also comes to the conclusion that Griff is the late 
Rhaegar Targaryen
's friend 
Jon
Connington
, the former 
Hand of the King
.
Tyrion also reveals his 
Lannister
 roots to the party, but there is no time to discuss loyalties or intentions. The 
Shy
Maid
 is attacked by 
stone men
. He helps to make efforts to ensure the safety of the now-revealed young prince on
board, but the dwarf is knocked into the water, dragged down by one of the stone men.

Reek III
Synopsis
Theon
 travels to 
Moat Cailin
 under a peace banner to present 
Ramsay Bolton
's terms of rendition to the 
Ironborn
garrison guarding its three towers.
The Ironborn are in bad shape. They have been long isolated from supplies, apparently forgotten by 
Victarion
 who
brought them there before leaving for the 
Kingsmoot
. The North's 
crannogmen
 keep them under constant siege and
their morale is so low that they no longer bother to even dispose of their dead.
Their nominal leader 
Ralf Kenning
 is only barely alive, suffering a painful, slow, ugly death after being infected by
a poisoned arrow. Theon, torn between his conditioning to think of himself as Ramsay's plaything Reek and his
orders to present himself as Lord Balon Greyjoy's son, has glimpses of his past pride and identity and actually mercy
kills Ralf Kenning before making demands of the mostly 
Codd
 men that still survive in the garrison.
Dagon Codd
 attempts to refuse his terms, but 
Adrack Humble
 kills him. The Ironborn surrender to Ramsay Bolton
and hear empty promises of food and peace before being mercilessly killed and displayed at stakes along the road.
Theon, still thinking of himself as Reek, is further humiliated by Ramsay and "rewarded" by being "promoted" to
the role of a dog. He meets Lord 
Roose Bolton
 as his own forces arrive at Moat Cailin with a sizeable number of
Frey
 men, including 
Hosteen Frey
 and 
Aenys Frey
, both of whom Theon recognizes from his time at their side as
part of 
Robb
's war campaign. At this point only about a fifth of the Northmen who went south with Robb Stark have
returned alive.
Theon recognizes the newly arrived bride of Ramsay as an impostor; she is not 
Arya Stark
 as claimed, but rather
Sansa
's friend 
Jeyne Poole
.

Synopsis
Following the departure of 
Stannis
's host, 
Castle Black
 is in a quiescent state, with the exception of the training yard.
Although Stannis has vacated 
Mormont
's former chambers in King's Tower, Jon does not move in, knowing that
others may misconstrue the move as a sign that he does not expect Stannis to return.
Against 
Bowen Marsh
's wishes, Jon accompanies a line of wagons under armed escort to deliver food to the
wildlings
 who have taken refuge underground at 
Mole's Town
. As they notice several faces carved into various trees
along the road, he comes to realize that the wildlings may have bent the knee to Stannis and feigned to embrace the
Lord of Light
, but in their hearts they will never abandon the 
old gods
.
A riot nearly breaks out as Jon's men deliver rations to the wildlings, with many complaining about the small
amount of food they receive. Jon promises the wildings adequate food, shelter, and weapons if they help the 
Night's
Watch
 defend the Wall, informing them that they have the choice: work with the Watch, or face the 
Others
 alone. In
spite of their misgivings, many wildlings agree to join, children, 
spearwives
, and fighters alike, including 
Halleck
,
the brother of 
Harma Dogshead
. However, 
Sigorn
 and the rest of the Thenns refuse the offer. When the rations are
all distributed, the wagons are loaded with 63 wildings heading back to the Wall. Jon remembers something 
Mance
Rayder
 told him, that the wildlings do not follow names or sigils. They follow strength.

Tyrion VII
Synopsis
Tyrion is dreaming of his 
lord father
 and the 
Shrouded Lord
. In his dream, they are one and the same. He wakes up
with his mouth dry and rusty with the taste of blood and his heart hammering in his chest.
Tyrion learns that after being knocked overboard during the battle with the 
stone men
, he was rescued by 
Jon
Connington
 and 
the prince
 forbade the crew to throw him, near-dead, overboard. Tyrion is being treated with
vinegar, to reduce the danger of an infection with 
greyscale
. Prince Aegon is also still aboard and irritated about it;
however, his companions insisted on keeping him safe, as 
Selhorys
, where the 
Shy Maid
 is currently docked, fears
an imminent attack by an approaching 
Dothraki
 
khalasar
 and they do not want to get caught up in the chaos. To pass
the time, Tyrion goads Aegon into playing a game of 
cyvasse
 with him, using it as an opportunity to probe the boy
for information. Aegon asks Tyrion about his 
real father
, but Tyrion can tell him little; he himself only saw Rhaegar
once or twice before 
Robert's Rebellion
, and was a small boy hidden away at 
Casterly Rock
 when Rhaegar died at
the Trident
.
Tyrion learns from Aegon that the child murdered by 
Gregor Clegane
 during the 
Sack of King's Landing
 was a
tanner's son
 from 
Pisswater Bend
 whom Varys purchased and substituted for Aegon in the cradle. After the Sack,
Varys smuggled the baby Aegon across the 
narrow sea
 to 
Illyrio Mopatis
, who made the arrangements for Aegon's
upbringing. Tyrion jokes that it will make a good story for the singers when he returns to Westeros, assuming
Daenerys Targaryen
 takes him as her consort. Aegon is stunned by this, having clearly never considered the
possibility that Daenerys might refuse him. Tyrion points out that she is a proud, strong, and fierce young woman
who is unlikely to appreciate a relative coming to her with a begging bowl, certainly not one with a stronger claim to
the 
Iron Throne
 than her own. Aegon angrily denies being a beggar, pointing out his own army, the 
Golden
Company
. Tyrion responds that Daenerys has a larger army than his own and owes nothing to Aegon. Aegon
protests, trusting in Lord Connington to win her over. Tyrion calls him a fool, and gives him the following warning:
Trust no one, my prince. Not your 
chainless maester
, not your false father, not the gallant 
Duck
 or the lovely
Lemore
 nor these other fine friends who grew you up from a bean. Above all, trust not the cheesemonger, nor
the Spider, nor this little dragon queen you mean to marry. All this mistrust will sour your stomach and keep
you awake at night, ’tis true, but better that than the long sleep that does not end.
Tyrion then suggests a different course of action to Aegon: head to Westeros instead of going east, land in 
Dorne
and take advantage of all the problems caused by the 
War of the Five Kings
. He points out that the 
North
 is in a
chaotic condition, the 
riverlands
 are devastated, while 
Stannis Baratheon
 holds 
Storm's End
 and 
Dragonstone
. The
coming winter will starve out the realm. He then paints the opposition as particularly weak: King 
Tommen
Baratheon
 is just a boy, and all his potential regents come with their own problems. 
Jaime Lannister
 actively avoids
the responsibility of ruling, and 
Kevan Lannister
 is a born follower- he will only take the rule if it is offered to him.
Mace Tyrell
 will have to fight the Lannisters to become regent, and Stannis' unpopularity makes him an unlikely
choice. That leaves only one potential candidate: 
Cersei
. Tyrion is particularly scathing of his sister's ability to rule,
comparing her to some of the worst Targaryen kings, noting that Cersei, in her paranoia and impatience, will undo
all the alliances his father created to secure Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne and adds that if Aegon acts quickly,
he can take advantage of the chaos and make serious gains before Cersei is overthrown and someone more

competent takes her place.
When Aegon protests, asking how they can win without his aunt and her 
dragons
, Tyrion points out that he doesn't
have to conquer the Seven Kingdoms; he only needs to start winning victories, acting not as a beggar, but a true
scion of 
House Targaryen
, like his ancestor 
Aegon the Conqueror
. When he does, word of it will get back to
Daenerys, and she and Aegon can meet as equals. Tyrion is convinced that Daenerys will fly to Aegon's side and
immediately love him, as he is the last of her line, and she is above all a "rescuer".
To re-emphasize his point to Aegon about trusting no one if he wants to survive in the game of thrones, Tyrion wins
the cyvasse game using a piece of bad advice he gave and which the prince took at the start of the game. Aegon does
not take his loss well; the sudden burst of anger convinces Tyrion the boy 
might be a Targaryen after all
.
Later that evening,Haldon takes Tyrion into Selhorys in search of information, where they confirm the rumors that
Daenerys still has not left Meereen. They need to know more, so Haldon takes Tyrion into an inn where they bribe a
customs officer. 
Qavo Nogarys
, to learn more. They learn many things, such as the fact the rulers of 
Yunkai
 are
spreading slanderous propaganda and offering heavy bribes to convince 
Volantis
 to side with them against
Daenerys, whose attack on the slave trade has made her enemies in Volantis. By contrast, it is learned that the red
priests of 
R'hllor
, particularly the High Priest 
Benerro
 are supporting Daenerys, and preach Volantis's destruction if
the city's rulers side against her, along with other apocalyptic prophecies. There are also rumors of Khal 
Pono
's
khalasar
 approaching the city, though they are confident they can, as usual, buy off the Dothraki.
Later, Tyrion convinces Haldon to let him find a brothel and goes searching for 
Tysha
. He finds his way into a cheap
brothel where he fucks a Westerosi looking girl, retches, fucks her again and then leaves ashamed of himself. On his
way out, he stumbles drunkenly into a 
Westerosi man
 who takes him prisoner to be "delivered to the queen".

Galazza Galare

 to offer once more the suggestion that she marry. She
suggests as a suitor 
Hizdahr zo Loraq

neither of them love nor even express much physical attraction to one another, Hizdahr promises to put an end to the
attacks by the

demonstration of Hizdahr's promise. If he succeeds, Dany agrees that she may accept his wedding proposal. After he

another plan, to see if Hizdahr can prevent the attacks, and if he can she will marry him out of duty to her people.
Ser Barristan tells hers that during her assembly with the Green Grace, 
Daario Naharis
 has returned. Dany
commands to see him at once, overcome with lust. Despite her growing passion, during the meeting Daario upsets
her with his barbaric suggestions as solutions to her problems and she sends him away. Dany tells Barristan to forbid

The Griffin Reborn
Synopsis
After the disappearance of 
Tyrion Lannister
, Lord 
Jon Connington
 decided to continue their route to 
Volon Therys
.
There, the former lord of 
Griffin's Roost
, 
Haldon
 and Prince 
Aegon
 arrive at the camp of the mercenary 
Golden
Company
 to meet their officers.
On their way, the man called Griff recalls memories of the time when he served with the mercenaries himself - the
Golden Company was founded by former combatants and knights of the 
Seven Kingdoms
 who were defeated in the
Blackfyre Rebellion
. Jon Connington joined the Golden Company after his own defeat at the 
Battle of the Bells
, at
Stoney Sept
, when he failed to capture the then-rebel 
Robert Baratheon
, seventeen years ago. It is revealed that
Connington was dismissed from the Golden Company for ostensibly stealing from their war chest, but in reality left
their service as part of a plan staged by Lord 
Varys
 to make his ignominious dismissal more forgettable. The
Company was previously led by Connington's close friend Toyne but now it is led by "Homeless" 
Harry Strickland
,
a man skilled in negotiating lucrative contracts but cowardly facing combat, in the eyes of Connington.
After presenting the young Griff as Prince Aegon Targaryen, son of the late Prince 
Rhaegar Targaryen
, to the
highest-ranking members of the Company, the officers, including Connington, voice their lack of enthusiasm for the
complicated situation. They did not anticipate that Daenerys would decide to remain in 
Meereen
 instead of marching
out to meet her enemies and joining with them. Strickland reveals that the Golden Company has received a large
number of alternative offers, including some which would involve them joining the coalition currently arrayed
against 
Daenerys Targaryen
. They also bemoan the constantly-changing plans of 
Illyrio Mopatis
 and Varys, who did
not anticipate 
Viserys Targaryen
's death or that Daenerys would go to Slaver's Bay rather than 
Westeros
. Seeing
their disillusionment and an opportunity to claim the Iron Throne for his own, Prince Aegon offers them an
alternative, earlier proposed by Tyrion: He does not wish to try to rally Daenerys and her dragons, but instead to sail
to Westeros with the hope of obtaining support from 
Dorne
 in accordance with 
Doran Martell
's own plan for
avenging Princess 
Elia Martell
. Aegeon reasons that once he and the Golden Company have begun the rebellion,
Daenerys will cross the 
Narrow Sea
 to join him. This proposal is met with great enthusiasm from the officers, except
Harry Strickland, who nevertheless has no choice but to comply.
Once agreed on the new plan, Aegon is taken on a tour of the mercenary camp. Connington retires to his quarters,
satisfied with the new situation and impressed with a side of Aegon he has not previously seen. He hopes to return
home to the castle of his ancestors and repay his debt to his old friend Rhaegar. It is then revealed that he is slowly
succumbing to 
greyscale
 (presumably acquired during the attack by the Stone Men), which is beginning to spread in
his hand - he hopes that he will live several more years to see his ward sit the Iron Throne.

The Spurned Suitor
Synopsis
Quentyn Martell
 and his two companions have joined the 
Windblown
, a sellsword company of two thousand people
led by a 
Pentoshi
 noble known as the 
Tattered Prince
, under false names. Quentyn has assumed the name "Frog",
Gerris Drinkwater
 now goes by "Dornish Gerrold" or "Drink", and 
Archibald Yronwood
 is now "Greenguts". Their
goal is to reach 
Slaver's Bay
 and eventually 
Daenerys Targaryen
 in 
Meereen
 without drawing too much danger or
attention, although they keep that a secret from their colleagues.
The company was paid for by 
Yunkai
 to fight and kill the 
Butcher King
's successors in 
Astapor
, where they are
currently mounted, three miles away from the gates. There they faced Astapor's still-untrained new 
Unsullied
, far
less formidable than those that Daenerys has with her in Meereen.
"Frog" learns that the Windblown are going to Yunkai for provisions before marching for Meereen to fight
Daenerys' forces. While they prepare to leave, he learns many malicious and fearful rumors about Daenerys' past and
present, some of them more grounded in truth than others.
On the way to Meereen, the Tattered Prince receives instructions from Yunkai to hunt the Astapori survivors that
have left the ruins of Astapor and drive them away from Yunkai, either back to Astapor or further north to Meereen.
It is believed that about half of those survivors are carriers of the 
bloody flux
. The Windblown will fight side by side
with the 
Company of the Cat
, another group of sellswords that has fought against them in the past.
The leader of the company has however decided to play both sides, and selects a group of Westerosi men, including
Quentyn and his companions, to make for Meereen and contact either the 
Second Sons
 or the 
Stormcrows
, offering
to defect to Dany. He selects 
Pretty Meris
 to command that group and suggests believable justifications for their
decision to turn cloak. The group will have to be careful to avoid retaliation from the Company of the Cat or of the
Long Lances
 who know nothing of their plans and might not approve or care if they knew.

Synopsis
Asha
 is at 
Deepwood Motte
 with her men, having fled the Iron Islands after the 
Kingsmoot
. She receives news from
Barrowton
 that 
Moat Cailin
 has fallen to 
Ramsay Bolton
.
At 
Ten Towers
, Asha received tidings that 
Euron
 had married her to 
Erik Anvilbreaker
, so she now lingers at
Deepwood Motte, knowing that she cannot return to the Iron Islands without having to submit to her new husband.
Asha takes note of the fact that Deepwood Motte is an old castle, yet not a strong one, as proven by her quick
capture of it. She also tells herself that she will not be captured alive by the Boltons, and will fight to the death in
any attempt of capture. She suspects that the next attack will come from the Boltons. Of the thirty longships that set
out to capture Deepwood, only four remain with Asha and her followers council her to take flight. Asha refuses,
stating that she will only fights, not run.
Asha and 
Qarl the Maid
 have sex on 
Galbart Glover
's bed and she reflects on their long relationship, regretting that
they cannot marry, as Qarl is too low-born. During the night, the alarm is raised – it turns out that five Flint men
from the mountain clans have tried to scale the wall. Asha’s men defeat them quickly. A single survivor claims that
they were alone, attempting to save 
Lady Glover
. But Asha’s brutal interrogation reveals their true purpose: to open
a gate for the three thousand men coming to take Deepwood Motte.
Asha is unsure who is leading these men and she makes the sudden decision to try to flee for their ships instead,
hoping that the northmen have not burned the beached ships she left behind. She is confident, however, since she
always beaches half her ships and leaves the other half out at sea with orders to move to 
Sea Dragon Point
 if they are
attacked.
On the way back to the ships, Asha realizes that it is dangerous to speed through the thick woods at night and they
cannot light torches or else attract attention and an attack from the northmen. She decides to rest with her men and
wait for sunrise in order to flee more quickly and safely. The northmen catch up to them, however, and a bloody,
confusing battle ensues. Asha observes that the northmen are wearing shrubs and trees and thinks to herself that it is
as if the very woods were attacking them. The battle continues with Asha fighting back to back with Qarl. Amidst
the confusion, she loses him and is eventually hit in the head with an axe by a northman.

Synopsis
Tyrion
 and his captor arrive at 
Volantis
, where Tyrion is put in chains so he will be taken for a 
slave
 and thus no one
will listen to or help him. Tyrion tells his captor he knows that he is Ser 
Jorah Mormont
 and that Jorah has been
working for 
Varys
. Tyrion further explains that he is also on a mission from Varys, thus making them allies, but
Jorah is unmoved by his argument.
Jorah takes a room in the 
Merchant's House
, chaining Tyrion to the wall for the night. The next day, they hear that
the 
Golden Company
 (which Tyrion knows was hired by 
Aegon Targaryen
 and 
Jon Connington
) is headed west,
putting an end to Tyrion's hopes of being rescued by them in Volantis.
In the morning they head into the dining hall of the Merchant's House, where Tyrion sees another 
dwarf
 and notices
that he has been recognized. He tells Jorah, who is not concerned. Tyrion later reflects that this other dwarf seems
somehow familiar. They then talk to the 
widow of the waterfront
, a former slave and now the powerful widow of a
triarch of Volantis
, who is sympathetic with 
Daenerys Targaryen
's actions. Jorah tells her that he needs to book swift
passage to 
Meereen
 and Daenaerys. She asks Jorah why he seeks Daenerys and he answers, "To serve her. Defend
her. Die for her, if need be." The widow does not trust his motives, however.
Suddenly, a chaotic fight breaks out. Tyrion is attacked by the knife-wielding dwarf, but Jorah effortlessly rescues
him. Tyrion realizes this dwarf is a girl, and upon questioning her, they learn that the she is 
Penny
, one of the tilting
dwarfs from 
Joffrey
's 
royal wedding
. Her brother, also a dwarf, was mistaken for Tyrion and beheaded by sailors,
but she was set free when they realized she was a girl.
The widow instructs Tyrion to take the 
Selaesori Qhoran
, a trading 
cog
 which is destined to 
Qarth
 by way of 
New
Ghis
, but Benerro has foretold that it will not reach this destination. She gives him a message to deliver to Daenerys
from the slaves of Old Volantis: "Tell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon."

 in the yard and asks to spar with three of his best men, telling them all to come at him at the same
time. 
Rattleshirt
 sees them and tells Jon that he should fight a man and not boys and they begin to spar. Rattleshirt is
getting the best of him, despite fighting with a larger greatsword and no shield. Eventually they lose their swords,
roll, and the fight ends with Rattleshirt on top. He is dragged off and Jon remarks that Rattleshirt fought well.
A raven arrives with a message that Jon's half-sister 
Arya
 is to marry 
Ramsay Bolton
. The others ask how old his
sister is, and he replies that she is eleven and that he has no sisters, only brothers in the Night's Watch. Jon later
remembers his sister and the sword 
Needle
 he once gave to her, wondering if she still has it.
He goes for a walk and sees 
Melisandre
, though at first he believes her to be 
Ygritte
. Melisandre tells him that he
should not worry over matters of the heart and that she sees that his sister will flee this marriage and ride towards
them on a dying horse. She also foresees that three of the rangers sent out will die, and come back eyeless. As she is
leaving she tells him that when the dead men return, he should take her hand and she will save his sister.

Synopsis
Davos
, still imprisoned in the 
Wolf's Den
, is awaiting his death and hopes that he will at least die honorably, losing
his head first and not his hands. He passes his time chatting to the guards, gaining a few favours in the form of
candles, books, paper & a quill, as well as learning a little more about the general history of the north. Davos writes
a few letters to his sons to be delivered upon his death. It is then that 
Robett Glover
 appears at his door and politely
asks him to follow; Davos is wary but notes his mannerisms and follows.
He is led through secret hallways always going in different directions, passing the old godswood on the way.
Eventually they end up in a room of the 
New Castle
 where Lord 
Wyman Manderly
 is waiting for him. He declines
the offers of food and wine; Lord Wyman though, apologizes for his poor treatment of Davos. Wyman tells him that
they must talk fast, as the 
Freys
 wait above, and Davos can hear the sounds of music and chatter above. Lord
Wyman says that they must act quickly for Davos is "dead" and his head sits upon the Seal Gate. A criminal similar
in appearance to Davos was executed in his place, his head and hands (with fingers carefully shortened) mounted on
the wall. He then learns that Lord Wyman Manderly only plays along with the Freys because he has to, as his son
Wylis Manderly
 is being held hostage, though he drinks for his safe return.
Davos says he was quite convinced by Wyman's daughters' behaviour, though he was confused by 
Wylla Manderly
.
Wyman responds that his young granddaughter was extremely brave to have said those things. There was truth in
her words as the debt the 
Manderlys
 owe the 
Starks
 and 
Winterfell
 can never be repaid. He adds though that he
cannot show any sign of contempt to 
King's Landing
 for fear of the harm they might do to his son. 
Tywin Lannister
told Wyman that he must confess his treason, yield White Harbor, declare his loyalty to 
King Tommen
, and bend his
knee to 
Roose Bolton
. If he refused, Wylis would be killed as a traitor, White Harbor would be sacked and his
people would "suffer the same fates as the 
Reynes
 of Castamere". If he complies, his son will be released. By
"killing" Davos, he has proved his loyalty to the Iron Throne and assured the release of Wylis, which Davos notes is
a brave move.
Wyman adds that he has been unable to send Stannis more information in his letters because the Freys infest his
court, looking for any sign of treachery and his 
maester
 
Theomore
 is 
a distant cousin to the Lannisters
, so Manderly
does not trust him. Manderly goes on to add his rage at his son 
Wendel Manderly
's death at the hands of the Freys,
calling it murder and the Freys' claims fables. He tells Davos that the 
North
 remembers and his son is home,
meaning that his act for the Freys is almost over as well.
He then summons 
Theon
's mute squire 
Wex
, who survived the 
Sack of Winterfell
. Davos is told by Robett that
Theon was captured at Winterfell, and is currently being flayed by the Boltons. He adds that all the women were
also captured and marched away. Davos listens to the horrible things that 
Ramsay Bolton
 does to the captured
women, sending them naked into the woods with half a day's head start before hunting them down with his dogs.
Every so often, according to Manderly, some wench lives to tell the tale, but most aren't as lucky. If caught, they are
raped, flayed and their corpses fed to his dogs, while their skins adorn the 
Dreadfort
. If he considered them good
sport, he slits their throats before he flays them, otherwise it is the other way around.
Robett tells a stunned Davos that the evil is in Ramsay's blood, sired from rape. Wyman adds that the Freys are no
better than Ramsay. He also tells Davos that Roose lies and played a darker part in the 
Red Wedding
 than he has
admitted. In addition, Davos is told that the Boltons and Freys know the northmen are not expected to believe their

lies but will be forced to accept them or else die as well.
He tells Davos about the mighty fleet he has built up, which Davos saw when he entered the port. Furthermore he
has plenty of silver in his vaults and has more heavy horse than anyone else north of 
The Neck
. Wyman states that
Oldcastle
 and 
Widow's Watch
 will follow his lead, all of the lands east of the 
White Knife
, from Widow’s Watch
and 
Ramsgate
 to the 
Sheepshead Hills
 and the headwaters of the 
Broken Branch
 will be pledged to 
Stannis
Baratheon
 if Davos meets his one price. He says he does not need a king but a smuggler. He needs Davos to
smuggle home 
Rickon Stark
, his true liege, and one who holds a stronger claim than 
Arya
, who is soon to be wed to
Ramsay Bolton.
The true story about what happened at Winterfell comes out then; Wex hid in the godswood, and 
Rodrik Cassel
 was
murdered by Ramsay Bolton. Wex also says that six survived the siege, two of them the sons of 
Eddard Stark
. Four
of the people went north and two went another way. Manderly insists that they must have the boy and his 
direwolf
as proof of his identity should the Boltons try to deny him. Wyman asks Wex to show them where they went and he
throws a dagger at the spot on the map. Davos looks long at where the dagger has landed, pondering whether it
would be better to go back to the dungeons and eat porridge for breakfast as it is better than 
places where men break
fast upon human flesh instead
.

Daenerys VI
Synopsis
Daenerys
 begins every morning my counting the enemy ships in the harbour. Today she has counted roughly
twenty-five. She has an argument with her admiral 
Groleo
, who is advising her to send her dragons to attack the
enemy fleet. Daenarys tells him to attack with ships, but he replies that she dismantled his ships, and all the timber
in twenty leagues has been burned so he can build no more.
Hizdahr
 has thus far had success in preventing further murders. She has had her betrothed followed and 
Skahaz mo
Kandaq
 reports that Hizdahr has visited eleven pyramids and it has been twenty-six days since a murder has been
attempted. He surmises that he must be one of the 
Sons of the Harpy
 or else these others would not have listened to
his words alone. Skahaz asks that he may question Hizdahr, but Dany will not let him, stating that she must trust in
Hizdahr or face open rebellion in the city. Skahaz also advises her that the fleets in the blockade all have family
members in 
Meereen
 and that she should use them as hostages, a contemplation she also rejects. 
Barristan Selmy
advises her that she has done a wise thing.
Grey Worm
 meets with her next to tell her that the first refugees from 
Astapor
 are arriving in Meereen and that
Astapor is burning. Dany learns of 
the fall of Astapor
, and that many inhabitants have contracted the 
bloody flux
while under siege, with the survivors now fleeing towards Meereen. The survivors also say that they believed and
waited everyday for Daenerys to come and save them. She tells them that they will be safe in Meereen now. Dany is
advised not to let the survivors and their illness into the city, and reminded again of 
Eroeh
 and of how sometimes
those whom she tries to save end up worse off.
There are further appeals to use the dragons, however they are followed with comments that they cannot be
controlled right now, and even the 
Unsullied
 are afraid to go into the dragon pit to feed them. Dany says she cannot
and will not unleash the dragons at this point in time. Ultimately she decides not to let the Astapori into the city and
that they should have a separate camp outside the city until the flux passes.
Ser Barristan appeals to her to take the battle to the enemy. She then reminds herself that a queen represents her
people and not just her own person. She thus decides that she cannot have the Unsullied take the field or else she
would have to leave the 
Brazen Beasts
 alone to defend against the Sons of the Harpy which will not suffice. She
then says that she must marry Hizdahr, for the good of the city.

Reek III
Synopsis
Melisandre
 is in her chambers, looking into the fire and trying to receive her visions. When she looks for Stannis,
she sees eyeless faces staring out, crying blood. Then she sees towers by the sea followed by skulls rising out of the
ocean turning to mist and great winged beasts flying in the sky. She tries to see the girl on the fleeing horse again as
she knows 
Jon
 will want to know more, but she cannot find anything. She does see that there is death around Jon
and that dangers and enemies lurk all around him.
When 
Devan
 asks her what she sees, she replies with her usual answer "Much and more." She does not let him know
how difficult it is or how much pain she endures to try and see these things, for fear of letting others know that this
task is not as simple as she lets on. Melisandre knows and sees that 
Davos
 is the most loyal to 
Stannis
 thus she has
kept Devan back against the young boy's wishes. She knows that Davos has lost too many sons already and although
Stannis has ridden out, she keeps the boy in order to save one of Davos' sons.
Melisandre does not sleep much, often just an hour a night, as she fears to dream and what she sees there, re-
occurring images of the words "Lot Seven" and "Melony".
She sends Devan to go get 
Rattleshirt
 and bring him to her. She speaks with him and tells him to keep his bones on,
in order to keep the 
glamor
 spell active. She also asks that he go and fetch the girl she saw on the dying horse. She
tells him of her vision and asks him where the girl might be coming up, and, knowing the North well, he can guess
her location, west of 
Long Lake
. Their talk is disrupted by the single long drone of a horn, marking the return of the
rangers. She tells Rattleshirt to wait for him there and she goes to see the rangers, thinking of her prediction of three
dead rangers.
Upon arrival she sees Jon with the heads of 
Black Jack Bulwer
, 
Hairy Hal
 and 
Garth Greyfeather
, impaled on
spears. She walks with Jon and they go back to her room. There he sees Rattleshirt, but she removes the glamor to
show him that he is actually 
Mance Rayder
, whom she has spared. She tells him that he will bring Jon back his
sister, but Jon mistrusts her. She does not reveal the difficulty of her glamor spell to the men, thinking to herself that
the more effortless sorcery appears, the more men fear it and her.

The Prince of Winterfell
Synopsis
Ben Bones
, 
Skinner
, 
Sour Alyn
, and 
Damon Dance-for-Me
 return to the 
keep
 of 
House Stout
 from a search for some
Frey
 men with 
Ramsay Bolton
. 
Theon
 knows this means that Ramsay may want to take his anger out on someone,
most likely Reek. He knows that Ramsay has been forced to restrain his violent outbursts in 
Barrowton
 as he needs
the loyalty of the 
Dustins
 and 
Ryswells
, but what he does behind closed doors is none of their concern. Ramsay then
throws a severed head for Theon to catch, which he cannot because of his maimed hands. He does not recognize the
head as it is covered in blood, rotting, and bursting with maggots.
Theon is then ordered to put away the men's horses. He is followed by 
Big Walder Frey
, who, Theon notes, does not
take after his older cousin in the malicious ways of the flayed men. Theon asks Big Walder who the man's head
belonged to, and he replies it was just an old man who called Ramsay "Lord Snow."
Then there is a feast, and Theon is chained to the wall and waits his turn to eat, though the dogs provide the night's
entertainment fighting each other for scraps. Theon remembers when Ramsay told him that 
all the dogs
 are named
after peasant girls he hunted, raped, flayed, and killed. He notes the next litter will likely include a 
Kyra
. It is then
that 
Roose Bolton
 enters the hall with some of his men. Here it is discovered what happened to the Frey men and
why they were searching. The Freys rode ahead of the procession of the 
Manderlys
. Wyman Manderly stopped
frequently to feast, but the Freys rode on and disappeared. Roose says that 
Hosteen Frey
 and 
Aenys Frey
 are
distressed, but Ramsay says it is of no concern, as there are plenty of Frey men at 
the Twins
.
Ramsay and Roose argue; Roose says that his son is acting brash and foolish and drawing attention to himself with
his cruel and barbaric amusements, that his fore-bears were no fools. He notes that they have powerful allies in the
Freys and the 
Lannisters
, but the northmen despise them and only accept 
House Bolton
's authority grudgingly (with
only the exception of Lady 
Barbrey Dustin
, whose support Ramsay would cast aside because she hates him; Roose
points out that Lady Dustin was fond of his late son, 
Domeric Bolton
, and holds Ramsay responsible for his death).
They talk briefly about the dead sons of the 
Starks
, and what might happen if they were to "return" from the dead;
Roose angrily chides his son for openly discussing his part in the 
Sack of Winterfell
, pointing out that their northern
vassals would turn on them in an instant if they learned the truth. Roose then changes the subject by informing
Ramsay that 
Stannis
 has marched from the Wall, adding that it is not towards the intended trap at the 
Dreadfort
 that
the 
Karstarks
 baited, thus revealing that the Karstarks are double-crossing Stannis.
Roose tells Ramsay he is to wed 
the fake Arya Stark
 not in Barrowton, but in 
Winterfell
. By doing so, the clansmen
who follow Stannis will be incensed to march on the keep, something they would not do while the Boltons are in
Barrowton; once Stannis lays siege to Winterfell, Arnolf will turn on him there. Roose then takes Theon away from
Ramsay. Ramsay tells Theon to observe everything and report back to him, but he is to say nothing about his
treatment to Roose.
As they ride to 
Barrow Hall
, Roose tells Theon he knows what his bastard son has asked of him. He goes on to say
that he knows what the real 
Reek
 was like, the opposite of what Ramsay has turned Theon into. He notes that he
provided the first Reek as a servant to the unruly young Ramsay; he had intended it to be a cruel joke, but is now
uncertain whether Reek corrupted Ramsay or the other way around. Ramsay was the child of a rape, one that Roose

is not proud of; he chanced upon the beautiful young wife of an old miller while out hunting and decided to practice
the illicit tradition of the 
first night
, having the miller hanged and then taking the man's wife. The woman showed up
at the Dreadfort a year later with baby Ramsay; Roose had intended to have the woman whipped and the infant
thrown down a well, but when he saw the child had his eyes, Roose stayed his hand and agreed to aid them- he gave
the woman back the farm her husband's brother had stolen from her, had the man's tongue cut out to stop him telling
tales to 
Rickard Stark
, Roose's liege, and periodically sent the woman a few pigs, chickens and coin to help bring up
the bastard child on the condition she never tell the boy who his father was. He thinks that the woman may have had
a hand in turning Ramsay on to desiring goals outside the rights of a bastard. They also discuss Domeric Bolton,
Roose's true-born son, whom Roose suspects was killed by Ramsay. He also suspects that any trueborn sons he has
with his 
new wife
 Ramsay will likely kill, though he admits this might be best, as he believes he will not live long
enough to raise new sons to manhood and considers child lords the bane of a House.
They finally arrive at Barrow Hall, where Theon is brought to Barbrey Dustin, Lady of Barrowton. He is introduced
as Theon Greyjoy, true Lord of the Iron Islands, which frightens Theon into fits, having been tortured into calling
himself Reek. She asks Roose if Theon has gone mad, and he replies he most likely has, but it doesn't matter. Theon
claims he is not the turncloak, he died at Winterfell.

Later, there is a terrible storm, following which Tyrion spies Penny again. She says that the storm frightened her and
she thought she may have died. Penny tells Tyrion that she does not truly blame him for the death of Oppo.
After their talks Penny spends more time up on the deck, whereas earlier she spent much of the time hiding away in
her cabin. After that they began to spend more time together, Tyrion's witty playful attitude begins to cheer her up
and he hears her laugh and act a lot more like the girl she is.

Moqorro what else he has seen to which he replies that he sees only their shadows, but one most of all. It is a tall and

Synopsis
A respite at the falling of snow motivates 
Jon
 to range 
beyond the Wall
, leading the new recruits of the 
Night's
Watch
 who follow the 
old gods
 to the same grove of 
weirwoods
 in the 
haunted forest
 where he and 
Sam
 swore their
vows. Scouting ahead of them go 
Tom Barleycorn
, 
Big Liddle
 and 
Luke of Longtown
.
There are six new recruits - 
Hareth the Horse
 from 
Mole's Town
, 
Arron
 and 
Emrick
 from 
Fair Isle
, 
Satin
 from
Oldtown
 and the 
wildlings
 
Leathers
 and 
Jax
.
Of the sixty-three wildlings that Jon invited to join the Watch, Leathers and Jax are the only two to accept so far.
Among the others wildlings come to the wall, nineteen are girls and women and were sent to 
Hardin's Tower
 to
avoid trouble with the men in 
Castle Black
. Their presence makes the men uneasy and there has already been an
incident. The 
spearwives
 know how to defend themselves and their girls, and three men had to be locked in ice cells.
Jon means to garrison 
Deep Lake
, 
Sable Hall
 and 
Long Barrow
 with wildlings under command of offices of the
Night's Watch, and to choose an almost completely female contingent for Long Barrow in order to avoid future
harassment. 
Iron Emmett
 and 
Dolorous Edd
 will be Long Barrow's commander and chief steward.
Other wildlings are also a cause of tension and incidents with the Brothers of the Night's Watch, most noticeably
Halleck
 and his followers. Jon is also worried that the 
Thenns
 may blame him for the death of 
Styr
.
Tom Barleycorn finds a small group of wildlings, including a child and his mother, a Thenn, a 
Hornfoot
 and 
a giant
in the weirwood grove. With the advantage of surprise and an effort at diplomacy from Leathers, they succeed in
avoiding a fight and even convince the survivors to return to Castle Black with them.
The recruits swear their vows in the presence of the wildlings. As he hears the verse about guarding 
the realms of
men
, Jon realizes that his duties involve protecting the wildlings as well as any other men.
They return to Castle Black, bringing the two wildling corpses they found with them. Jon consigns the corpses to the
ice cells and receives a letter from 
Stannis
, learning that he succeeded at 
taking Deepwood Motte
 and received
support from various northern clans and houses along the way, including survivors from the 
battle at Winterfell
. His
troops now number five thousand and growing. Stannis has also learned that 
Ramsay Bolton
 means to marry 
Arya
 in
Winterfell
 and promises Jon to save her if he can. He means to have the help of 
Arnolf Karstark
 and 
Mors Umber
 at
his attempt to conquer Winterfell.
Jon wonders if Arya could have escaped without Stannis's help, as predicted by 
Melisandre
.

The Turncloak
Synopsis
The Arya impostor, 
Jeyne Poole
, is preparing for her marriage to 
Ramsay Bolton
, out of fear more than anything.
Theon
 reminds her that she should think of herself as 
Arya Stark
 at all times in order to avoid the dangers of
enraging Ramsay. Her plight moves Theon considerably.
Theon has been chosen to ceremoniously present "Arya" in marriage to Ramsay, since he was the longtime ward of
Eddard Stark
 and it is widely believed that Arya's trueborn brothers are dead. 
Jon Snow
 is a bastard half-brother and
while Theon believes 
Bran
 and 
Rickon Stark
 to be alive, he does not dare to reveal that.
Meanwhile, 
Winterfell
 is suffering from both a hard white frost and the looming menace of the coming of 
Stannis
Baratheon
's troops. Even so, Ramsay marries Fake Arya in the 
godswood
. A bard by the name of Abel arrives
uninvited, with six women followers, to perform for the wedding. Theon believes that he hears his name ("Theon")
whispered by the godswood, after months of thinking of himself only as Reek. That and the memories of a different
life in a far livelier Winterfell shake him deeply.
After the marriage, there is a banquet with many northern guests, including Lord 
Wyman Manderly
, who is
particularly pleased with the meal
. Lady 
Barbrey Dustin
 engages in a surprisingly frank conversation with Theon
about her mistrust of the Boltons and of the 
maesters
 of the 
Citadel
.
Ramsay calls for Theon and cruelly humiliates both him and the fake Arya (Jeyne) in his quarters.

Synopsis
Balon Swann
 has arrived in 
Sunspear
, with the 
skull of Gregor Clegane
. He asks that 
Doran Martell
 takes his seat in
the 
small council
, and that 
Myrcella Baratheon
 and 
Trystane Martell
 accompany them to 
King's Landing
. His
captain of the guard, 
Areo Hotah
, notes that many of the Dornish nobility present, including the bastard daughters of
Prince 
Oberyn Martell
 do not join in the toast Prince Doran makes to King 
Tommen I Baratheon
. Hotah also notes
that Balon would be more of a challenge to defeat than 
Arys Oakheart
 was.
When the feast is done, Prince Doran summons his daughter, 
Arianne
, and the 
Sand Snakes
 to his solar and tells
them that he has arranged that Myrcella will tell Balon that it was 
Darkstar
 who injured her and killed Arys. Once
that is done, 
Obara Sand
 is to lead Balon to Darkstar's lair at 
High Hermitage
 and destroy him. Doran also reveals to
the Sand Snakes that sources loyal to him in King's Landing have told him the truth he was not meant to hear of this
visit to the capital; Queen Regent 
Cersei Lannister
 plots to have Trystane killed on the way. An ambush is planned
somewhere in the 
kingswood
, where their party will be attacked by outlaws and Trystane will be slain. Blame for the
attack will be placed on the Imp, 
Tyrion Lannister
, as the outlaws will be crying "Halfman!" during their attack and
Balon will claim to catch a glimpse of the Imp. The Sand Snakes are disbelieving, but Doran points out that knights
of the 
Kingsguard
 are sworn to obey, regardless of their personal feelings on their orders, and points out that Balon
argued against traveling by sea to return to King's Landing, as this would disturb the planned arrangements. Doran
still does not want to defy the 
Iron Throne
 openly, so 
Nymeria Sand
 is to accompany Myrcella back to King's
Landing and take the seat on the council, while 
Tyene Sand
 is also to travel to King's Landing, ordered to try and get
close to the 
new High Septon
 and thus give the Martells an ear amongst 
the Faith
.

Jon IX
Synopsis
Jon
 sends 
Val
 to the north, to find 
Tormund Giantsbane
 and offer him and his followers shelter south of the 
Wall
.
Bowen Marsh
, 
Septon Cellador
, and 
Othell Yarwyck
 talk to Jon with various complaints; they disapprove of
Leathers
 as Castle Black's master-at-arms, 
Satin
 as Jon's steward and his decision to negotiate with Tormund and
allow him and his men through the Wall. They are also nervous about the fact Jon is keeping two corpses in the ice
cells, and react with outrage and horror when Jon reveals he is waiting for them to rise, ignoring Jon's argument that
the Watch knows next to nothing about the wights or their masters, and need to learn more if they are to defeat them.
Overlooking their protests, Jon tells them of a large group of 
wildlings
 making for 
Hardhome
 at the east coast north
of the Wall, following the witch 
Mother Mole
 who claims they will find ships there to bring them across the 
Narrow
Sea
. Jon fears they will die there, but when he gets only indifference from the others at the prospect of thousands of
dead wildlings, Jon finally loses patience. Angrily asking if they don't realise the truth or are just ignoring it, Jon
points out that if they do nothing, the wildlings at Hardhome will die in their thousands, and when they are dead, in
time they will rise up again with blue eyes and cold hands, and the 
Others
 will have thousands more 
wights
 under
their control to send at the Wall.

A Ghost in Winterfell
Synopsis
A winter snowstorm has hit 
Winterfell
. 
Roose Bolton
 comments that the northern gods do not favour 
Stannis
 as he is
at the mercy of the weather while they are sheltered in Winterfell. His men cheer, but 
Theon
 does not join in and
notes that the 
Freys
 do not join in either, unfamiliar with the north that has claimed three of their lives already.
Wyman Manderly
 is eating at a feast of porridge, while 
Harwood Stout
 and 
Whoresbane Umber
 chat. Theon spent
the whole last night awake dreaming of escape, but ultimately decides he has no where to go; he is a ruined man in a
ruined castle, and this is where he belongs. The bard Abel plays "
The Dornishman's Wife
" with one of his women
beating a drum, but he switches the lyrics to a northman instead. Theon fears that this will be seen as a spite to the
Boltons
, cost the man his life, angering Ramsay and getting Theon flayed as a result. But when both of the Boltons
laugh, the others see that it is safe so they laugh as well and join in with the bawdy song.
His thoughts fall to 
the fake Arya
, taking note that she has remained locked away in her room. There are whispers
that 
Ramsay
 keeps her chained naked to the bed, but Theon believes that it is only the guards that keep her there. He
has seen bruises on her body as 
Sour Alyn
 has assigned Theon as Jeyne's handmaid. Theon told her that Ramsay
only hurts people when they make him angry, so she should do as he says and no harm will come to her. But she
only cried and called him Theon, and he corrected her, telling her that his name is Reek.
Rowan
, one of the bard's women, comes up to Theon and asks him about his exploits, telling him that Abel can
make a song about his capture of Winterfell. She questions him on how he was able to conquer Winterfell so easily,
wondering if there was a secret entrance or another way that he used to get in. Theon thinks this is another ploy from
Ramsay as he desires Rowan, so he runs away, leaving her.
Outside there is a snowball fight between boys from the 
Rills
 and 
Barrowton
, while squires build snowmen along
the battlements. Theon observes that a new stable has been built, twice as large as the one that was burned down. He
wanders through the castle and passes 
Rickard Ryswell
 cuddling one of Abel's women. He observes that they have
few provisions to last the winter in the keep, but thinks that Stannis is in the same situation. He eventually arrives at
the 
weirwood
, kneeling before the heart tree. There he apologizes for something, and asks for something that he is
unsure of - strength? He hears someone crying and leaves, thinking that there are ghosts in Winterfell, and he is one
of them.
Theon returns and sees that to command the snowmen, the squires have built a dozen snowy lords, including ones
resembling Lord 
Wyman Manderly
, Lord 
Harwood Stout
, Lady 
Barbrey Dustin
, and 
Whoresbane Umber
. Lady
Dustin asks him if he can show her the way to the crypts, as she cannot access them from the dungeons. As her men
dig through the snow, Lady Dustin asks Theon to convince Ramsay to treat Arya better. The northmen love the
Starks
 and hate the Boltons, remaining loyal only out of fear. The tears of Arya Stark will upset them and do Roose
and Ramsay more harm than anything Stannis could do.
Inside the crypts they find that some of the dead kings' swords are missing. A bad omen, Theon thinks, as the swords
are said to protect the crypt and keep the spirits of the dead from wandering. Dustin asks Theon why he loves the
Starks, and Theon reluctantly explains he always wanted to be one, but never could. Dustin remarks that they are

similar in that regard, explaining how 
Brandon Stark
 took her maidenhead and was enamored with her rather than
with his betrothed, 
Catelyn Tully
. 
Rickard Stark
 arranged the betrothal of his eldest son to Catelyn, a match that
served his ambitions more than one to Lady Barbrey, a daughter of one of his own northern vassals. After Brandon's
betrothal to Catelyn, the ambitious Lord Ryswell wanted Barbrey to marry 
Eddard
, but after Rickard and Brandon
were both murdered by 
the Mad King
, Eddard fulfilled his older brother’s betrothal to Catelyn to ensure support
from 
Riverrun
 during 
Robert's Rebellion
. Left to marry Lord 
Willam Dustin
, she blames Ned for Lord Dustin's
death at the 
Tower of Joy
 during Robert's Rebellion. She felt slighted that Eddard merely buried her husband in
Dorne
, yet went to great lengths to transport 
his sister's
 body north to be buried at Winterfell.
She claims that she intends to seize Ned Stark's bones, delayed by the Iron Born's occupation of 
Moat Cailin
, and
feed them to her dogs, rather than let them be buried in the crypt. On the way back up she tells him to repeat nothing
to the Boltons. Theon swears he will not, to which she says he has been trained well, leaving him there.

The Sacrifice
Synopsis
Stannis's
 host departs from 
Deepwood Motte
. 
Asha
 is chained and carried on at the back of the baggage train under
guard by 
Alysane Mormont
. Stannis means to bring her to 
Winterfell
 to show off the Kraken's daughter as his
captive and a sign of his strength. They believe the three hundred mile march through the 
Wolfswood
 should take
them about fifteen days to Winterfell.
She bent her knee at Deepwood Motte, but thinks to herself that others have bent the knee before, such as 
Balon
,
who rose again to fight another day. Wise advice years earlier from her father. As part of her surrender she hopes
that Stannis will spare the rest of her 
ironborn
 their lives, which he does, imprisoning them at Deepwood Motte. She
listens to talk between the northmen, seeing their pride in their king, though she predicts many if not all will die in a
siege attempt of Winterfell. Ser 
Justin Massey
 takes a courteous nature with Asha, treating her well. She believes he
is after her lands, but takes his company over being left alone.
After a few nights, she is brought to Stannis and tries to treat with him. She says that his brother 
Robert Baratheon
was renowned for turning his foes into friends, but learns that she should not speak his brothers name as it angers
Stannis.
The snow begins to take a toll on the passage of the southern men, however the northmen are used to this weather
and proceed quickly. Later she hears the queensmen, worshipers of the 
Lord of Light
, begin to contemplate a
sacrifice to appease their god and blow the storm away. Stannis does not listen to them, nor does he listen to the
pleas to make camp and wait out the storm. After fifteen days, the estimated time of arrival, they have only made
half the distance through nine days of storm. After thirty days, they have yet to reach Winterfell. 
Morgan Liddle
, the
man who nearly slayed her at Deepwood Motte, comes to apologize, but only for calling her a cunt, not for nearly
killing her.
Later they reach a small 
crofters' village
 where they make camp and try to catch some fish. Asha realizes that
Stannis is now a gaunt figure, having lost much weight on the march. They are encamped now and locked in by
snow, unable to move. Worse, they have almost no provisions, and are starving.

Synopsis
Daenerys Targaryen
 wakes up beside 
Daario Naharis
. She is hesitant about her upcoming wedding. Daario asks her
to marry him instead, but truly he knows that she cannot and will not. Outside the 
Yunkai
 are massing more ships,
building siege weapons to throw rocks at the city. However, no rams or siege towers are built, as the siege is
intended to cause famine and disease to force Meereen to succumb.
Daario introduces Dany to the three 
Dornishmen
 who say that they have specific gifts for the queen. 
Quentyn
Martell
, 
Gerris Drinkwater
, and 
Archibald Yronwood

 between Dorne and the Targaryens signed by 
Willem
Darry

turning into a prince.
Dany remembers 
Quaithe

The glass Candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after
her the others. Kraken and Dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them.
Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal
. She recognizes Quentyn and the arms of 
House Martell
 as
the sun's son she must be wary about.
Daenerys refuses to marry Quentyn. The Dornishmen make one last plea before Dany's wedding which she denies,
and then goes through with her marriage to

Synopsis
Queen Selyse
 arrives at Castle Black with 
Shireen
, 
Patchface
, 
Axell Florent
, and others, all on their way to the
Nightfort
. They are accompanied by 
Tycho Nestoris
, an emissary of the 
Iron Bank of Braavos
. 
Jon
 warns Selyse that
the Nightfort is still mostly in ruins and advises her that they may be most comfortable at 
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
.
The queen says that they are not safe there and insists on going to the Nightfort. Then, 
Wun Wun
 appears, startling
the ladies. The giant speaks a few kind words, but mangles them. Jon tells the women he is only just learning the
Common Tongue
 as all giants speak the 
Old Tongue
. Wun Wun's laugh startles and frightens the group, causing 
Ser
Patrek
 to draw his sword. Jon warns him to never draw his sword against a giant as he is protected by guest rights
here, which Jon says they still honor in the north, though the south may not.
Jon then offers to give Tycho a tour atop the Wall, but he prefers to speak with Jon now, preferably in a warm room.
Tycho tells Jon that the 
Iron Throne
 has ceased all debt payments to the Iron Bank. Jon thinks this must be madness
on the part of the 
Lannisters
. He thinks that the Iron Bank may want to support 
Stannis
 in his war to ensure that the
debt is eventually payed. Jon asks for a favour: to borrow ships and a loan to keep the 
Night's Watch
 fed until
spring. Tycho says this is impossible, but after a few hours of drinking and haggling they strike a deal.
With the three ships added to the Eastwatch fleet, Jon counts that they now have eleven ships. He hopes to bring the
wildlings
 down from 
Hardhome
 around the Wall in order to save them and not have them become more 
wights
 in
thrall to 
The Others
. However, he is unsure if 
Mother Mole
 will be desperate enough to trust her people to the men
of the 
Night's Watch
.
He discusses things further with Tycho; he asks after 
Maester Aemon
, 
Gilly
 and 
Sam
 but Tycho knows nothing and
Jon can merely hope they have reached 
Oldtown
. They talk about an unknown fleet prowling the narrow sea and
rumours of 
dragons
 coming from the east, Jon joking that a dragon would warm things up. Tycho says sternly that
his people
 are descended from those who fled the dragonlords of 
Valyria
 and they do not joke lightly about such, so
Jon apologizes.
They make their way to the common hall, where Axell Florent asks Jon to see 
Val
. Jon surmises that he must know
the woman is gone. He then excuses himself and leaves, pondering the dangers of the agreement with Tycho,
uncertain if the Watch will ever be able to repay the Iron Bank and thus avoid consequences. But Jon knows that
between being bankrupt and dead, he made the right choice. He also takes another moment to marvel on the
stupidity of the Lannisters; the Iron Bank is notorious for deposing royalty who don't repay their debts and he notes
that if Stannis makes a deal with the Braavosi, he will acquire enough money to hire numerous 
sellsword
 companies,
to bribe as many lords as he needs and keep his men fed, armed and supplied. Jon muses that unless 
"Stannis is lying
dead beneath the walls of 
Winterfell
, he may just have won the Iron Throne"
.
He goes to sleep but is awoken by 
Mully
, who tells him that a girl has arrived on a dying horse. Jon's thoughts
instantly go to 
Melisandre
's vision and he giddily thinks that 
Arya
 may have come to him as prophesied. He also
thinks about plans to keep Arya safe; she cannot stay at the Wall, for Stannis will just marry her off to one of his
vassals so as to gain a claim to Winterfell, and Jon doesn't know but fears what Melisandre may want with her-Jon

speculates that he might be able to convince Tycho to make arrangements to have Arya fostered with some noble
family in 
Braavos
 or the 
Free Cities
. When he meets her however, to his disappointment Jon sees that the girl in
question is not Arya; she is too old. He recognises her as 
Alys Karstark
, having met her before when they were both
children, when 
her father
 brought her to Winterfell in hope of negotiating a marriage between her and 
Robb
. She
warns him not to let 
Cregan Karstark
 take her back with him when he arrives, as he and his father 
Arnolf Karstark
intend to force her into marrying Cregan. She also learns the truth about her father's execution from Jon and is
unsurprised to learn that Robb killed him for murdering prisoners in a fit of rage; her father was a brooding man, and
her uncles are no better.
Alys asks Jon if there is still a blood-feud between them after the death of her father, but he assures her that men of
the Night's Watch hold no grudges. She tells him that after 
Jaime Lannister
 killed her two elder brothers and 
her
betrothed
 at the 
Battle of the Whispering Wood
, she and her brother 
Harry
 are the rightful heirs to their titles.
However, Harrion has been a captive for more than a year; Arnolf only declared Karhold for Stannis in the hope it
would provoke the Lannisters to execute Harrion. If that happened, Alys would be heir to Karhold, at which point
Cregan would marry her, get a child from her and then get rid of her. Jon offers to write to Stannis about the matter
on her behalf but Alys reveals that the Karstarks are playing Stannis false; they have long been in league with 
Roose
Bolton
 and are only waiting for his word to betray Stannis. Alys entreats Jon to protect her, pleading that he is the
only hope she has left.

The Ugly Little Girl
Synopsis
Arya
 wakes up after 
entering
 into 
Nymeria
 again; she remembers being feared, but only when she dreams. Arya is
still in the 
House of Black and White
 in 
Braavos
. She has been blinded, to train her to use her other senses:
recognize lies from the tone of voice, walk and work without seeing, even fight. She calls herself Blind Beth now.
She goes over her list of names, but remembers that that was someone else, not her, not Blind Beth.
The 
kindly man
 asks her his usual question about three things she has learned. Arya learns to play the lying game
with the 
waif
; this time however she is blind, so instead she learns to use tone of voice to hear the lies. Arya has
gotten better at speaking 
High Valyrian
, though the kindly man insists she learn the languages of 
Lys
 and 
Pentos
 as
well. As she continues to learn her skills as a blind girl, the kindly man tells her that she has five senses and she
should learn to use the other four. An acolyte gets into a duel of staffs with her, teasing her throughout the lesson.
She reminisces that she liked being the 
Cat of the Canals
; she thinks about when she killed 
Dareon
, the deserter
from the 
Night's Watch
. The Kindly Man told her that they are not gods to judge who lives or dies, they are just
servants of 
Him of Many Faces
. He explains that they are death's instruments, not death itself.
As she goes out to beg, the waif helps her to look the part, putting on a blindfold and giving her pox mark scars to
make her look ugly. As she goes out into Braavos past the 
Inn of the Green Eel
, she goes over the areas where she
has begged in her mind. Arya crosses the Bloody Bridge and makes her way to 
Pynto
 at the end of Ragman's Harbor
near the edge of the Drowned Town.
She hears that two Lysene pirate ships, the 
Goodheart
 and the 
Elephant
, were driven north by a storm and found
wildlings
 at 
Hardhome
. The wildlings were eager to board the ships that were prophesied by the witch, and the
pirates took the women and children on board, yet meant to sell them as slaves. The 
Goodheart
 was damaged in
another storm and was forced to make for Braavos, where the 
Sealord
 seized the ship since slave trade is forbidden
in Braavos.
Arya regularly has wolf dreams, and it is revealed that she has also learned to enter a cat. She uses knowledge
gained through the cat's eyes to impress the kindly man, telling him that she knows it has been him who is hitting her
but without mentioning the cat. Apparently this completes her blind training, because when she opens her eyes again
she sees a candle flame, and she has never seen anything so beautiful before.

Theon I
Synopsis
One of 
Roger Ryswell
's men has been found dead at the inner wall of 
Winterfell
. 
Theon
 hears Lord Roger Ryswell
declare that he must've fallen off the wall drunk, but he suspects it might have been murder, as do some others.
Roose Bolton
 and his host are still stuck inside 
Winterfell
's walls due to the relentless snow storms. They expect
Stannis' forces to attack them, but have no idea how close he may be due to the storms. Tensions rise among the
people inside Winterfell, with no one quite certain whether it is a good idea to wait passively for Stannis or instead
to pursue him outside. It doesn't help that food is somewhat scarce and distributed quite unevenly.
Holly
, one of Abel the Bard's washer women, sits down next to Theon, who is upset that she has touched him. She
asks him about the crypts, and a mistrusting Theon comes to the conclusion that she, Abel, and the other women
want out of Winterfell. Theon sympathizes, but he fears the wrath of 
Ramsay Bolton
 and prefers not to get involved.
The next morning 
Aenys Frey
's squire is found dead and naked outside in the snow. Later on that day another man, a
crossbowman sworn to 
House Flint
, is found dead with a crushed skull, presumably from a horse kick.
Nevertheless, the suspicions and tensions keep growing to the point that open quarreling happens among the host's
Lords inside the Great Hall. Some are tired of waiting for Stannis and want to attack him. A fight nearly breaks out
as 
Ser Hosteen
 and 
Aenys Frey
 blame 
Wyman Manderly
 for the deaths of their three kin 
Rhaegar
, 
Jared
, and
Symond
. It almost comes to a duel before 
Roger Ryswell
 and 
Barbrey Dustin
 calm them down, though Roose does
nothing throughout the near altercation and Theon sees something new in Roose's eyes for the first time: a hint of
fear.
Soon the newly rebuilt stable collapses, killing two men and twenty-six horses. Roose Bolton gives orders for the
surviving horses to be brought inside the walls of Winterfell.
A more suspicious death is discovered, that of 
Yellow Dick
. His namesake is stuffed in his mouth so hard that three
teeth have been broken. This death is taken more seriously as it cannot be confused with an accident and to boot he
is one of Ramsay Bolton's 
Bastard Boys
. Theon considers that a 
hooded man
 whom he meets may be responsible for
the murder. Theon is later ushered to see Roose by 
Steelshanks Walton
. Roose says that Theon has been seen where
all the murders have occurred. Theon is freed from the suspicions due to his weakened physical and psychological
state, as remarked by Lady Dustin and Roger Ryswell. It is now however undeniable that someone has been
committing murders, possibly at Stannis' behest. The resulting suspicion flames the tensions between the Freys and
the Northmen, who are reminded of their role at the 
Red Wedding
 and the fact they are surrounded by northern
Houses who all lost people at the Red Wedding and have more than good reason to despise and do harm to the
Freys.
Suddenly a war horn and drum is sounded, and the men inside the walls begin to believe that Stannis has arrived.
Theon goes to pray in the 
godswood
, seeing hints of 
Bran
's very face in the 
weirwood
, hearing it whisper his name.

Holly
,

but instead a nice, quick death - but first he must see Abel.

Synopsis
All remaining crewmen and passengers of the 
Selaesori Qhoran
 are sold into slavery in a 
Yunkish
 camp near
Meereen
. 
Tyrion
 and 
Penny
 are sold together to 
Yezzan zo Qaggaz
, an immensely fat Yunkish (though a 
Westerosi
sellsword tries hard to buy them-Tyrion suspects this is because the sellsword knows him and wants to claim
Cersei's
 bounty on his head) and put under the charge of his retainer called 
Nurse
.
Tyrion sees 
Jorah Mormont
 brought on the auction block behind them. The knight tried to fight off the slavers and
was beaten almost to the point of death, his face is so swollen as to be almost unrecognizable. Tyrion convinces
Nurse that Mormont is an essential part of their show and needs to be bought too. Jorah fought bravely, killing three
of the slavers, before being captured and beaten so severely. The fight went out of him once he heard that 
Daenerys
had wed 
Hizdahr zo Loraq
.
Once purchased, they are brought to Yezzan's pavilion, where they meet some of his other "treasures" and his most
prized possession 
Sweets
, a hermaphrodite. They are also fitted with slave collars, which Tyrion does not mind as he
observes that collars can be removed. There they find out that the sellsword who also tried to buy them was 
Brown
Ben Plumm
 of the 
Second Sons
. In the evening, Tyrion and Penny are summoned to perform a joust for the guests of
Yezzan, including the Yunkish supreme commander 
Yurkhaz zo Yunzak
. The joust is well received, following
which they are to pour wine and water for the guests. One of the men heard Tyrion's boast of his skill at 
cyvasse
.
Tyrion plays against him and wins, angering the man. He also plays Ben Plumm as his master bets on him; he wins
four of five matches, and earns much gold for his master.
As a reward for their great jousting performance, Yezzan announces they are to repeat it in the 
Great Pit of Daznak
in front of tens of thousands of people.

Jaime lifts the siege at 
Raventree Hall
. On his way to Riverrun and King's Landing, he encounters 
Brienne of Tarth
.
Synopsis
Jaime
 arrives at 
Raventree Hall
, under siege by 
Jonos Bracken
. The siege here is much smaller than the one at
Riverrun
 as the intentions are not to storm the castle but rather to starve them out. The siege has been going on for
six months and there is not much hope of rescue for 
Tytos Blackwood
 as it is only a matter of time.
Jaime meets first with Lord Jonos who is in an intimate position with 
Hildy
. After she leaves, Jaime inquires as to
what Jonos seeks from the situation. Jonos insists on acquiring a quarter of the 
House Blackwood
 lands, saying that
they were stolen from them long ago, and that 
Tywin Lannister
 promised them to Jonos if he subdued the
Blackwoods. Jaime chides the 
Bracken
 man saying that they were once an enemy of the king when they sided with
the 
Starks
, and keeping his head is more than enough compensation for what the 
Mountain
 did to his lands. Bracken
protests that he will keep faith with the crown as he did with the Starks; Jonos adds that a dozen good men of his
died at the 
Red Wedding
 with 
Robb Stark
 and he bent the knee because he saw no point in fighting on for a lost
cause. Jaime remarks that Lord Jonos is a prudent man on hearing this, yet privately thinks Blackwood might be
considered more honorable.
Jaime then goes to parley with 
Tytos Blackwood
. Inside he sees the castle's massive 
weirwood
 tree from which the
castle derives its name; the tree is black and leafless. Tytos tells Jaime that it is the fault of the Brackens, poisoned
and barren for a thousand years, and in another thousand it will turn to stone as weirwoods never rot. As they treat,
Jaime tells him that he does not have to physically kneel to him. They agree to a confession, fealty, pardon, and
financial sum as well as lands. Finally they discuss the matter of a hostage, and Jaime asks for 
Bethany
, his
daughter, but Tytos refuses as she is his only daughter. They eventually agree to sending 
Hoster
 as he is a bookish
boy who may enjoy his time in 
King's Landing
 and all the books there. Jaime then leaves quickly as he has
appointments in Riverrun and King's Landing. The boy is ready to leave with him within an hour. Before departing,
he meets Ser Jonos to tell him the resolution, but also informs him that a daughter of his is to attend to the queen in
the capital, as she too is to be a hostage.
Jaime rides to the village 
Pennytree
 with Hoster, who tells him of the history of the lands and animosity between the
Blackwoods and Brackens. In the village stands an ancient oak tree with pennies nailed to it, the namesake of the
village. There, 
Brienne of Tarth
 finds them, bandaged on her face, and with the sword 
Oathkeeper
. Brienne claims
that she has found 
Sansa
, and that Jaime must accompany her alone or else 
Sandor Clegane
 will kill the girl.

Daenerys IX
Synopsis
Hizdahr
 holds a feast in 
Meereen
 with the 
Yunkish
 lords and sellsword captains in attendance, to sign the peace and
celebrate the imminent reopening of the 
fighting pits
. However, the sellswords and slaves from Yunkai and its allies
are still besieging Meereen. Just as in Meereen, the 
bloody flux
 has been affecting the Yunkish troops as well.
Daenerys is upset that the Yunkai'i are holding a slave market just outside the city, but 
Hizdahr
 tells her it is only for
a time and to let them have their show and they will have their peace, with Yunkai keeping their slave trade and
Meereen remaining out of it.
The Yunkai'i have brought representatives of the four sellsword companies serving them: the 
Tattered Prince
 for the
Windblown
, 
Gylo Rhegan
 for the 
Long Lances
, 
Bloodbeard
 for the 
Company of the Cat
 and 
Brown Ben Plumm
 for
the 
Second Sons
. Daenerys is relieved by 
Daario
's absence, since she knows that he would be furious with Plumm.
An exchange of seven hostages has been arranged in order to ensure a measure of peace during the cerimonies. The
four sellsword captains and the three Yunkish nobles present 
Yurkhaz zo Yunzak
, Supreme Commander, and two
others) are understood to be Daenerys' hostages for the time being, while Daenerys offers seven of her own to the
Yunkish siege camp in exchange (Hizdar's sister, two of his cousins, her bloodrider 
Jhogo
, her admiral 
Groleo
, her
Unsullied
 captain 
Hero
 and Daario Naharis).
Skahaz mo Kandaq
 the Shavepate is absent as well, having been replaced as commander of the 
Brazen Beasts
 by
Hizdahr zo Loraq's cousin, 
Marghaz zo Loraq
.
Were he not a hostage, Daario might be causing trouble. He is unhappy about Dany's wedding to Hizdahr, and he
got furious when 
Quentyn Martell
 revealed that his group of 
Westerosi
 Windblowns had been ordered to "defect" to
Meereen. Daario nearly slew them all in his rage, but 
Grey Worm
 intervened and stopped him, choosing instead to
imprison the group of Windblowns.
Brown Ben comes up to her and explains his defection, saying that it is natural for sellswords to change sides if they
believe that it will improve their odds of survival. He claims that the Second Sons were troubled when they learned
that Daenerys could not use her dragons to help fight the Yunkish forces. After he leaves, she asks Ser 
Barristan
Selmy
 his opinion, as he was hiding and listening as always. He advises her that Brown Plumm is quite truthful, and
confirms that it is not wise to place trust in a sellsword.
Seeking ways to make up for the loss of the Second Sons, Dany asks Ser Barristan about the possibility of finding a
rival leader in the group that might want to "remove" Brown Ben Plumm. Barristan thinks it possible, but doesn't
know for certain. She then mentions the other three mercenary companies, prompting Barristan to offer to arrange a
meeting with Gylo Rhegan or the Tattered Prince if she wants so. Dany says that this is not the time or the place as
there are too many watchful eyes about. Barristan admits that he is not the best man for such work, and that back in
Westeros, it would have been 
Littlefinger
 or 
the Spider
 to have done this kind of work.
Dany's mind turns back to the captured Westerosi turncloaks. She realizes that by freeing one of the Windblows she

might establish negotiations with their leader, the Tattered Prince, and perhaps sway them to her cause. She first
suggests and later commands Ser Barristan to send back the woman 
Meris
 as a gesture of her regard, knowing that
their captain will get the message. She wants to contact the Long Lances and the Company of the Cat as well.
Barristan advises against dealing with Bloodbeard of the Company of the Cat, however; he says that he reminds him
of the 
Ninepenny Kings
, that he is much too greedy and much too dishonourable to be an asset. Daenerys feels that
such men might be the easiest to sway, but decides to trust his counsel on this matter.
She then summons Quentyn to speak further, at Ser Barristan's suggestion. He still believes that the Dornish envoys
are their best option for returning to Westeros, though Dany will not abandon her city. She speaks with him and
brings him to the dragon pit to see her "children". She introduces Quentyn to 
Viserion
 and 
Rhaegal
, telling him that
Drogon
 is away hunting, and that she is a dragon as well. Dany gives Quentyn another piece of advice to leave
Meereen, saying that he is not safe here, that men like Daario and Hizdahr could see him as a threat and eliminate
him. He boldly, perhaps foolishly, declines.
Dany then retires to bed where Hizdahr is waiting for her, drunk and lustful. She allows him to have his way with
her before he passes out. 
Missandei
 comes in and hears that the queen is unhappy and comforts her, talking of her
home 
Naath
. Eventually Daenerys falls asleep, though she dreads the morrow, when the fighting pits will reopen,
and blood will be spilled.

Synopsis
Theon Greyjoy
 is with some of the 
spearwives
, 
Rowan
 as well as 
Abel
. He tells them that it is madness to try to
escape as 
Ramsay Bolton
 will chase them and hunt them down with his dogs. Abel replies that 
Stannis
 must be close
by the sounds of the horns and it is unlikely Ramsay would ride out into that. Theon also begs that he not be allowed
to fall back into Ramsay's hands alive, to which 
Squirrel
 replies "Abel's word".
Hosteen Frey
 barges into the halls, announcing that 
Little Walder
, son of his brother 
Merrett
, has been killed. Theon
looks at the spearwives but Rowan replies that this is no work of theirs. 
Big Walder
 implicates the 
Manderly
 men,
saying that the boy went out to get some silver owed to him. The dispute turns into a spar of words and when Lord
Wyman Manderly
 insults both the dead boy and 
House Frey
 simultaneously, Hosteen draws his sword in a blind
fury and attacks Manderly, who is sliced under his chins and collapses; his knights leap to defend him and a vicious
and bloody fight breaks out. In the end, six 
White Harbor
 men lie dead, two 
Frey
 men, as well as one of Ramsay's
Bastard Boys
, 
Luton
. Roose and Ramsay quell the tension by telling the men present if they want blood, they should
turn their anger on Stannis. Hosteen replies that once they bring Roose Stannis' head, they will come for Wyman's.
Roose asks Abel to play them a song and the Freys leave. It is then that Rowan grasps Theon's arm, telling him that
the time must be now and that Abel can fend for himself. The plan is to dress 
the fake Arya
 up as Squirrel, while the
real Squirrel climbs away down the wall. They find the girl in her room, where she is terrified to leave, thinking this
is a trap set up by Ramsay. The girl tells the washerwomen that she has been trained, she won't escape, Ramsay does
not need to chop off her feet. They finally get her into Squirrel's clothes, and Theon tells her to follow 
Holly
 closely,
and not to run.
As they get to the gate they see some guards. Holly seduces one and kills him in the process while 
Frenya
 struggles
and kills the other- Jeyne lets out a scream in the process, revealing them. Frenya waits at the bottom and fights the
rest of the "kneeler"s that come to catch them, while Holly and the others get to the top of the wall. Holly then
realizes that Frenya has the rope, just before being killed by arrows.
Theon thinks that if they are caught now they will be brought to Ramsay and tortured. He then throws himself and
Jeyne over the battlements.

Synopsis
Daenerys
 bathes in preparation for her visit with 
her husband
 to 
Meereen
's fighting pits. Ser 
Barristan Selmy
 tells
her that the girl 
Meris
, whom they set free, said that the 
Windblown
 were willing to join her cause, if Dany gave the
Tattered Prince
 
Pentos
. Dany cannot agree to pay this as 
Illyrio
 is from that city and has helped her more than
anyone. Her obligations are to him first.
She then departs with her husband and they arrive at the pits, where 
Strong Belwas
 eats a bowl of fried locusts.
Hizdahr tells his wife that they are tasty as well, but she declines as Dany is not interested in the spicy food. There
are twenty thousand spectators in the pit. As Hizdahr announces the fights, they chant her name, though they use the
Ghiscari
 word for 
Mother
 because they cannot pronounce her 
Westerosi
 name. Dany thinks to herself that it is not
her they love, but the fighting.
The first fight begins with a victory for the 
Spotted Cat
, and there are many more after that. Following them, the first
folly of the day begins with two dwarfs jousting, 
one on a pig
, 
the other on a dog
. One dwarf has a shield painted in
the colours of 
House Lannister
, which amuses Daenerys. That one falls off the pig and is chased by the other on the
dog when Hizdahr tells Dany that they are about to loose the lions. She tells him this was not in their agreement, that
the dwarfs did not consent to this like the other fighters who died did, so she forbids that the lions slaughter the
dwarfs.
Up next is a bout between 
Barsena Blackhair
 and a boar. The fight goes well until the boar's tusk rips her open from
the knee to the crotch. The boar then jumps on her, pulling out her entrails, all to the displeasure of the crowd.
Daenerys insists on leaving as she is disgusted and no longer wants any part in this. Strong Belwas becomes sick
from his locusts, asking for a drink of milk.
It is then that 
Drogon
 appears, his attention drawn by the blood and screams. His fires sear the boar, before he eats it
and then Barsena. A man runs to try to kill the dragon, jabbing a spear into Drogon's neck before the dragon kills
him. Hizdahr commands the rest of his spearmen to kill the dragon. Drogon roasts two spearmen, breaks the
pitmaster in two with a swipe of his tail and tears out the innards of another spearman. As Strong Belwas is puking,
Dany runs into the fighting pit in a mad state, hearing footsteps behind her. When she gets close, she fears the
dragon does not recognize her and will kill her. As he blows fire at her she rolls under the flames, and she whips him
until finally he allows her to mount him. She leaps onto his back, pulling out the spear. As she whips him again, he
takes flight, and she tells him to go higher, watching as Meereen grows smaller below.

Synopsis
Jon
 treats with 
Tormund Giantsbane
. His four thousand 
wildlings
 will be allowed past the wall, including
mammoths and giants. They must leave one hundred boys as hostages at 
Castle Black
, and yield all valuables to pay
for food. The mammoths are to go the long way around through 
Eastwatch
 while the rest are allowed to go through
the gates.
Jon accompanies 
Val
 to go see 
Queen Selyse
 to tell her of the bargain. The queen is excited and tells him that her
husband will be proud, all the wildlings have to do is swear fealty to the king and convert to 
R'hllor
. This is when
Jon tells her that this was not part of the bargain, and Val adds that the free folk do no kneel. Selyse is quite upset
about this. Val notices 
Shireen
's facial disfigurements, noting that it is 
grey death
. Jon tells her that it is not always
fatal, but she is adamant that it is death, and that the baby "monster" must be taken out of that tower at once and
closer to her own person. She insists that Shireen is dead and that the queen and apparently Jon cannot see it.
He then goes to the top of the wall, wondering what has happened to 
Mance Rayder
 and if he has found his sister
Arya
. Up here he meets 
Torghen Flint
 of the 
first Flints
 and 
Brandon Norrey
, the 
Norrey clan
 chief. Jon tells them
that the wildlings are coming through, though they are not happy about it because of past conflicts. He tells them
that they must forgive crimes of the past if they are to live together. They are worried about their lands, but Jon tells
them the wildlings are to remain on the wall in the abandoned castles.
Bowen Marsh
 sees this agreement as a betrayal of Jon's vows to the 
Night's Watch
. However, Jon says that he is
sworn to defend the realms of men and asks him whether the people beyond the wall don't count as men. Thus it is
his intent to use all available resources to defend the realm of men against 
The Others
.

Synopsis
Cersei
 is still a prisoner of 
the Faith
. She wonders when 
Jaime
 will be coming for her, in addition to wondering what
has happened to 
Loras Tyrell
 as last she heard, he lay dying from his wounds on 
Dragonstone
. She only ever sees
three people which are her gaolers 
Septa Unella
, 
Septa Moelle
, and 
Septa Scolera
. Her last visitor was 
Qyburn
. She
hates all three of them as much as those she assumes have betrayed her, blaming 
Osney Kettleblack
, 
Orton
Merryweather
, 
Harys Swyft
, 
Aurane Waters
 and 
Grand Maester Pycelle
. She questions whether she should include
Jaime in that group but will not believe it. He would not abandon her, she assumes.
She feels helpless and hates that emotion, and she prays endlessly to the 
Seven Gods
, since that is what they want,
but it helps not. At first she fights with her guards but they are much stronger than she thought, they keep her up
endlessly, never letting her sleep. Exhausted, she comes to know that she must confess. She asks to be taken to the
High Septon
 to confess, where she admits to extra-marital affairs. She says she has slept with 
Lancel
 and the
Kettleblack brothers
. She insists she did these things because she was afraid for her children and these were her only
means to secure the trust of these men.
The 
High Sparrow
 still means to accuse her of high treason, incest, regicide, and deicide, all crimes that Osney
Kettleblack admitted Cersei had a part in under torture. She manages to talk her way out of the charges of murdering
the previous High Septon and 
Robert
 and bearing false witness against the Tyrell girls, and avoids the charges of
incest by saying that these are lies that Stannis has made up in order to gain the 
Iron Throne
, which satisfies the
High Septon, since the Faith is eager to condemn Stannis' 'worship of a 
red demon
'. To get the real truth, though, the
High Septon means to have her tried by the Faith or 
trial by combat
, where Cersei would be represented by a knight
of the 
Kingsguard
. He is unsure of all the crimes she has committed so the only way to pick the truth from the false
is to let the gods decide.
She is allowed a visit by her uncle 
Kevan
 who, though angry with her for corrupting Lancel, answers her questions.
He tells her that Jaime is missing after his return from 
Raventree Hall
, having disappeared with an unknown woman,
though they assume it is 
Brienne
. There is word of sellswords appearing all over the south. They do not have the
strength to deal with them, though 
Mace Tyrell
 does. However, he is unwilling to do so until the matter with his
daughter 
Margaery Tyrell
 is settled. Mace Tyrell is now the 
Hand
, 
Paxter Redwyne
 is the king's admiral, and
Randyll Tarly
 is the justiciar. The Tyrells brought up an army when their daughters were seized, although the High
Septon has admitted the case against them is weak.
Kevan brings worse news for Cersei. He relays 
Balon Swann
's news of 
Myrcella
's loss of an ear, and 
Arys
Oakheart
's death. Though Cersei is insistent that Myrcella's mutilation is 
Tyrion's
 doing, she sees a chance in the
open position in the Kingsguard, and asks Kevan to approach Qyburn for a replacement.

Strong
Belwas
 is still in mortal danger from the poisoned locusts that he ate during the reopening of the fighting pits,
Ser Barristan is told by 
Hizdahr zo Loraq
's seneschal 
Reznak mo Reznak
 that Hizdahr wishes to receive his Yunkish
guests without Barristan there, essentially removing the duties of the head of the Queensguard. Of all of Dany's
servants, only 
Missandei
 remains within the royal apartments, although she too has been replaced.
The Unsullied have been slighted by Hizdahr, and the 
Shavepates
 might well be more loyal to 
Skahaz mo Kandaq
than to Hizdahr, so the king lets himself be defended by pit fighters while he prepares for the peace discussions with
the Yunkai'i.
Meanwhile, disease
As he thinks that she may be flying home, Missandei appears behind him. She tells him that Dany would not leave
without them. She also says that Skahaz mo Kandaq the Shavepate wishes to meet with him, secretly. Barristan
agrees to a meeting at the stables at sunset. There, the Shavepate says that the 
Sons of the Harpy
 
poisoned the
locusts
 that Belwas ate, intending to kill Dany, that 
Volantis
 has dispatched its fleet, and that Hizdahr means to open
Meereen's gates for them.
Skahaz asks him to speak to 
Grey Worm
, as he will trust Barristan and support them. Selmy agrees to conspire with
the Shavepate against Hizdahr, and to attack the unsuspecting Yunkai'i before the fleet from Volantis can arrive to
take the city and enslave all Dany's people. He does this on the condition that Hizdahr's guilt can be proven and
Barristan thinks to himself that he will kill the man personally. Barristan says that he will go speak to Grey Worm.

Moqorro

swept overboard the

Tyrion

that Victarion would die unless the priest helped him. Moqorro succeeds in healing him, and Victarion has the
maester killed and makes for Meereen.

Synopsis
Yezzan zo Qaggaz
 is dying of the 
bloody flux
. A healer explains to 
Sweets
 that the only help for Yezzan is good
clean water. 
Nurse
 also got the bloody flux and died the night before after Tyrion gave him dogtail soup with silver
mushrooms in the broth. Tyrion asks 
Scar
, a soldier slave in Yezzan's ownership, to send 2 men to get fresh clean
water for Yezzan. Scar refuses because he will not take orders from a slave, even though he himself is a slave. He
tells Tyrion to get the water himself with Penny. Tyrion asks for the mule and the cart to get the water. Scar refuses
but gives them 
Jorah Mormont
 to help get the water. The three of them travel through the camp to the nearest well
south and west of a 
trebuchet
, the Harridan. On the way, Tyrion sees defenses being built to defend against the
possible return of 
Drogon
, although he knows that most of these will prove useless against 
dragons
. Tyrion knows
that a dragon's eyes are its only weak spot, and not the underbelly or throat as old wives' tales claim. While waiting
at the well, they hear the latest news and rumors from other slaves, who are discussing the event at 
Daznak's Pit
. It is
argued whether 
Daenerys Targaryen
 flew off on the dragon or died trying. Tyrion states she did not die because her
body was not found. He briefly thinks on the moment when he almost revealed his identity to her, only to stop out of
fear 
Barristan Selmy
 would prejudice Daenerys against him out of contempt for 
House Lannister
.
After getting the water, they are supposed to return to their camp, but Tyrion leads them to the tents of the 
Second
Sons
 instead. He knows that right now, while Yezzan is on the verge of death, is the best time for them to try and
escape the grasp of the slavers. When they get there, Tyrion is recognized as the dwarf that 
Brown Ben Plumm
wished to buy so they are brought to the captain. There he reveals that he knows that Ben Plumm knows who Tyrion
really is and that Tyrion knows that Plumm is a westerman and of 
House Plumm
 and that the dragons were fond of
him. He implies that he knows more about Plumm's lineage than even Plumm himself, and that Plumm may have
more 
Targaryen
 blood than he thinks. Ben Plumm then recognizes Jorah Mormont, and Tyrion convinces Ben
Plumm to let him and Mormont join the Second Sons instead of killing him in order to win a lordship from 
Cersei
Lannister
. Tyrion suggests they play a game of 
cyvasse
 as they continue talking.

Synopsis
Tormund Giantsbane
 along with over three thousand 
wildlings
 pass the 
Wall
 at 
Castle Black
. The price of their
entry, which was negotiated between Jon and Tormund, is that the wildlings will yield all valuables so that they can
be sold for food, as well as one hundred boys as hostages. Initially, two girls are included in the one hundred
hostages, although Jon spots them and they are replaced by two new boys. Tormund voluntarily includes his own
son as a hostage as a sign of good faith. Jon decides to take him on as his own squire.
While watching the Wildlings pass through the wall, Jon and Tormund speak of many things. Jon mentions that
Melisandre
 burned the 
horn of Joramun
 that Mance and the wildlings were supposedly going to use to break down
the Wall. Tormund tells Jon that although they did find that huge horn in the 
Skirling Pass
, it is not actually the true
Horn of Joramun, or they would have used it when they assaulted the Wall. Jon, confused, tries to decide whether it
was Mance that lied to him or Tormund lying to him now about the authenticity of the horn.
The rear guard of the Wildings with Tormund includes a warg who is accompanied by his boar. 
Ghost
 and this boar
seem to be on edge around each other, and it is mentioned that they should be restrained while the wildings are
staying at Castle Black. Most of the wildlings will be relocated in the coming weeks.
Later, Jon receives a letter from 
Cotter Pyke
, saying that he is stranded at 
Hardhome
, and calls for help. He also
reveals that the Braavosi captains on loan from Tychos would only allow wildling women and children aboard their
ships, and that the Woods Witch has taken to calling them slavers. This explains Arya's report that the wildlings
from Hardhome had been captured by slavers, as narrated in "The Blind Girl". He also says there are 
dead things
both in the woods and the water, lending a great deal of urgency to his message.

The Kingbreaker
Synopsis
Ser 
Barristan
 attends 
Hizdahr zo Loraq
's court under the unease that 
Daenerys Targaryen
's absence brings.
The 
Brazen Beasts
 now have a new commander - the king's cousin, 
Marghaz zo Loraq
. 
Reznak mo Reznak
 keeps a
strong voice in court, counseling the new King.
Harghaz
 is now acclaimed as a hero after his fight against Drogon.
Ser Barristan notices the presence of 
Quentyn Martell
 and his two Dornish companions at court, remembering his
former companionship to Prince 
Lewyn Martell
, his 
Kingsguard
 colleague and also Quentyn's uncle. He considers
the possibility that the 
poisoned locusts
 that 
Strong Belwas
 ate might have been meant for Hizdhar, as part of a plot
to direct Daenerys into marrying Quentyn, given that 
another of the prince's uncles
 was notorious for poisoning
those who got in his way.
Before he makes up his mind on the matter, three 
Wise Masters
 envoys from 
Yunkai
 arrive, along with their
sellsword 
Bloodbeard
, to talk with Hizdahr. They show Admiral 
Groleo
's severed head as a gesture of intimidation,
claiming his death as payback for the death of 
Yurkhaz zo Yunzak
, who was trampled to death during the panic
when 
Drogon
 attacked the 
Fighting pits
.
Ser Barristan reminds King Hizdahr that Yurkhaz's death was accidental, while the Yunkai representatives free three
of the six remaining hostages. They demand that the dragons be destroyed as a condition for the release of the last
three hostages. Barristan is also suspicious of Hizdahr's lack of reaction, given that all three of the 
Westerosi
 kings
he served under- 
Aerys
, 
Robert
 and even the supposedly weak 
Jaehaerys
- would have responded to such an insult by
ordering every member of the Yunkish delegation killed; he also believe Bloodbeard is trying to start violence in
order to get the plunder the peace has denied him.
As the court is ended for further deliberation of the King's council, Ser Barristan decides to counsel the 
Dornishmen
.
Despite appearing weak, the King has taken notice of Quentyn, and Ser Barristan considers it dangerous for them to
remain in 
Meereen
. He advises them to return immediately to 
Dorne
, going so far as offering the coin for the trip,
and reveals that there was an attempt at poisoning either Daenerys or her consort during the fighting pits reopening.
Quentyn's shocked reaction reassures Ser Barristan that the Dornishmen had no part in the poisoning, but he still
counsels Quentyn and his companions to leave Meereen and return to Dorne, for he considers his prospects of
marriage unpromissing and his situation dangerous.

The Sacrifice
Synopsis
Jon Connington
 and the 
Golden Company
 have landed at 
Cape Wrath
 in 
Westeros
, and manage to seize 
Griffin's
Roost
 and other small castles by taking them unawares. The 
taking of Griffin's Roost
 was quite easy; the Golden
Company only lost four men in the attack. Any raven trying to leave the castle was shot down, followed shortly by
the castle's 
maester
 being thrown from his tower. After that, what was left of the garrison surrendered.
Taking his leave of the Golden Company officers by claiming to be going to pray at his father's tomb in the castle
sept, Jon instead goes to the battlements and reminisces over the time 
Rhaegar
 visited his home and seemed
impressed with Connington's lands. Jon then reflects on what happened next to 
his House
; after 
Aerys
 exiled Jon,
furious at his failure to stop Robert, the lands and title went to his cousin 
Ronald Connington
 (who had been Jon's
castellan while he was in 
King's Landing
) but after the end of 
Robert's Rebellion
, 
King Robert
 stripped Ronald of
his lordship and gave most of House Connington's lands to houses that had fought for him. Jon, however, is glad that
he will not have to fight his deceased cousin or Ronald's son 
Ronnet
, who is away fighting in the Riverlands, to
reclaim Griffin's Roost, not wanting to celebrate his return by killing one of his own kin. Nor does he blame his
cousin any longer for taking advantage of his downfall, since as far as Jon is concerned, the one responsible for
House Connington's downfall is himself.
Jon's musings then turn to where he lost everything: 
Stoney Sept
. Taking over pursuit of Robert from the 
Tyrells
after the 
Battle of Ashford
, Jon cornered the rebel in the town and began searching for him. But the search yielded
nothing, as the townsfolk were protecting Robert, hiding him and constantly moving him. All of Connington's
efforts to find Robert- offering bribes for information, taking hostages, threats and pardons- got him nowhere, and
the delays bought time for 
Eddard Stark
 and 
Hoster Tully
 to bring a rebel army to Robert's rescue. The rebels
attacked Connington's men at the same time Robert and his followers emerged from the town in a counterattack, and
the 
ensuing battle
 ended in a rebel victory. For years, Jon reflects that he insisted he did all he could, until 
Myles
Toyne
 disabused him of that notion by pointing out that 
Tywin Lannister
 would have burned Stoney Sept to the
ground to kill Robert, then offered pardons to Stark and Tully when they arrived to convince them to give up and go
home. Connington, however, knew this would mean killing everyone in the town, and he both didn't want to be
branded a murderer and wanted the glory of slaying Robert for himself. Jon reflects that his failure at Stoney Sept
led to Rhaegar's death at the Trident and vows not to fail Prince Aegon as he failed his father.
Re-joining his fellows, Jon takes note of the captives, including Ronnet's brother, sister and bastard son. Most of the
castle staff swear loyalty to him. Connington pays a visit to 
Haldon
, who is trying to interpret where most of the
Golden Company, scattered along the coast by the Volantene ships that transported them from 
Essos
 to send a
message to 
Doran Martell
 to inform him that his nephew 
Aegon
 is alive, in order to gain the Dornish alliance. Jon
reflects that he could not have expected loyalty from these men if he had reclaimed his home while 
Robert
 and
Renly
 still held the Stormlands. Haldon also argues that they need to offer incentives to convince recalcitrant lords
to join them-as most of the gold and land will go to the Golden Company officers that was taken from their
ancestors, Haldon suggests offering the hands of Prince Aegon and Jon himself for marriage alliances. Jon, however
refuses, in the face of his illness and his insistence that Aegon must be free to wed 
Daenerys Targaryen
 if she ever
returns home. In his chambers, Jon privately treats his 
greyscale
 with wine. If his condition became known, he fears
that any lords still loyal to 
House Connington
 would abandon him.

Four days later, Prince Aegon arrives along with 
Duck
, the first member of his 
Kingsguard
. Jon recalls his
disapproval of that choice and how he argued with Aegon that they should leave places in his Kingsguard open to
both warriors of great renown or the younger sons of important lords to add lustre to their cause, but Aegon refused,
saying all he wanted from his Kingsguard was their willingness to die defending him, pointing out that Jon's criteria
for the Kingsguard perfectly fits 
the Kingslayer
. Jon informs him that his men plan to take 
Storm's End
 in ten days
(he had refused the suggestions of the Golden Company officers to make an alliance with 
Stannis Baratheon
, who
holds it, arguing that Stannis is Robert's brother, a rival claimant to the throne and leagues away from them with
nothing to offer). Aegon agrees to this plan, and tells him that he intends for the siege to go forward with one
change: Aegon will lead the attack himself.

Synopsis
Asha Greyjoy
 is still a prisoner of 
Stannis Baratheon
 at the 
crofters' village
 between the lakes, being guarded by
Alysane Mormont
. While they thought they would be only three days from 
Winterfell
, the snows have kept them
stranded for nineteen days. Food has become a major concern. The supply of fish from the lake has been
diminishing, they have already been relying on their dying horses as a source of food for a while now, and foraging
has brought little result. Some men have even begun to resort to cannibalism: four men from 
House Peasebury
 were
caught eating parts of a dead man from 
House Fell
.
There are growing tensions between the 
queen's men
 that Stannis brought with him from Dragonstone and the other
people present, both local northerners and the 
king's men
 that Stannis brought from 
Dragonstone
 and the 
Stormlands
with him.
Fueling those tensions, Ser 
Godry Farring
 the Giantslayer, Ser 
Corliss Penny
 and Ser 
Clayton Suggs
 are about to
burn the four cannibals in sacrifice for 
R'hllor
, hoping to stope the snowfall. Northerners 
Artos Flint
 and 
Big Bucket
Wull
 express dislike of the sacrifice. Asha has noticed that Clayton Suggs is a cruel man and fears that he may
eventually turn against her.
Stannis himself has been retreating to a tower roof with a perennial flame for four days, since his squire 
Bryen
Farring
 was given a funeral burning after dying from the cold. He returns now, along with Queen's Man Ser 
Richard
Horpe
 and 
Karhold
's castellan 
Arnolf Karstark
, whose men joined theirs eight days past. There are rumors that
Arnolf may hold Winterfell in Stannis' behest if they are successful at retaking the castle. Stannis authorizes the
sacrifice and watches it until its end.
Ser 
Justin Massey
 remains close to Asha and protects her from the worst of Clayton Suggs' threats. He also reveals
that he is no longer a true believer in R'hllor and hints that he knows more than he is telling.
Justin offers to guard Asha for a while, relieving Aly Mormont from that duty. The two of them eat some roasted
horse in the hall. Stannis' knights are however lost by a lack of options, knowing that they are likely to die soon no
matter what they do, since they have no food nor are they in any condition to fight 
Roose Bolton
's forces at
Winterfell. Talk is tense and frustrated, and eventually Justin leaves the Hall. Attempting to follow him, Asha finds
Clayton Suggs instead. He threatens her, but the two of them are surprised to find that riders are coming to Stannis'
encampment.
Assuming that this is an attack from the Boltons and 
Freys
, Clayton commands Asha to warn the others while he
alone attempts to delay the riders. But there is no immediate danger, for the riders are not hostile. It is instead the
group of 
Tycho Nestoris
, representative of the 
Iron Bank of Braavos
, with two men of the 
Night's Watch
 and the
seven 
ironmen
 that he ransomed from 
Sybelle Locke
. Asha recognizes 
Tristifer Botley
 among them.
The group has come by way of Winterfell, where they found 
Crowfood Umber
 beating drums and blowing horns,
and have brought 
Theon
 and 
Jeyne
 from Winterfell.
Jeyne's nose is black from frostbite, and no one has referred to her by name yet, so it is not clear whether Tycho's
group knows that she is not 
Arya Stark
. Asha fails to recognize Theon, who looks decades older than she knows him
to be. Theon, however, reveals his identity to Asha, much to her shock.

Victarion insists that the

 will help them on their journey. Though his arm and hand are now burned, they
are stronger than ever. He says, 
“Two gods are with me now...No foe can stand before two gods.”
The Iron Fleet captures a number of trading ships: 
Ghiscari Dawn
, 
Dove
, two unnamed ships that he renames as
Ghost
 and 
Shade
, an unnamed fat galleas, an unnamed trading galley, an unnamed fishing ketch, and a slaver galley
named the

appreciation, Victarion burns seven 
Lyseni
 bed slaves as a tribute to both the 
Drowned God
 and R'hllor. After this
sacrifice, a favourable wind rises for the Iron Fleet, which now numbers 60 ships with the new additions.
That night, Victarion allows Moqorro to inspect the 
Dragon Horn
 given to him by his brother 
Euron
. Moqorro reads
the 
Valyrian
 glyphs displayed on the horn to Victarion, telling him that the horn's name is written as 
"I am
Dragonbinder
."
 Moqorro goes on to explain that no mortal man can blow the horn and live. However, he states that
"Who blows the hellhorn matters not. The dragons will come to the horn’s master. You must claim the horn. With
blood.”

After a gathering of eleven 
Faceless Men
, 
Arya
 is interrogated by 
plague face
 and deemed ready for her first
assassination. The 
kindly man
 informs Arya that she will need a new face for this job, since Cat of the Canals would
be easily recognized. He and the 
waif
 lead her down into a hidden chamber deep under the 
House of Black and
White
. The walls are covered with mask-like faces, which Arya realizes are the faces of people who die at the House
of Black and White. The face chosen for Arya is that of a young girl who was abused to the point of permanent
disfigurement, and came to the House seeking death.
Arya's blood is used to soften the leathery mask into living skin, which then bonds to her head and becomes her new
face. The kindly man warns Arya that she will suffer the nightmares of the girl whose face she has taken, but only
for a time. His promise proves to be true, and that night Arya dreams of the abuse that was suffered by the girl at the
hands of her father. The next day, Arya is given her first target. He is an 
elderly man
 running an insurance scam at a
shipyard.
The target is always accompanied by two guards, and the kindly man has forbidden her to kill anyone other than her
target, so Arya must stalk the man for several days to find an opportunity. She eventually dispatches him by slipping
a poisoned coin into the purse of his client, knowing the man selling insurance will bite into the coin to test its
legitimacy. The Kindly Man is pleased by her success, and raises her to the status of an acolyte. He gives her a black
and white robe to wear while at the House and restores her face. However, the next day she is to take a new face and
leave for her first apprenticeship with someone named

Synopsis
Cersei
 is forced to walk from the 
Great Sept of Baelor
 to the 
Red Keep
, as atonement for her confessed sins; it is the
only way to escape the Sept, as her uncle 
Kevan
 will not oppose the Faith and Cersei does not not have enough
friends in the Sept to risk a trial like 
Margaery Tyrell
 - her only hope is a trial by battle. Cersei feels fear at the
thought of being paraded through the streets naked, remembering the violence the smallfolk caused during the 
riot
,
but reassures herself that no harm will come to her.
When morning arrives, her goalers arrive with a group of 
Silent Sisters
, who strip Cersei naked and shave her of
every hair on her body. Cersei is then led by an escort of 
Warrior's Sons
 (among them, her cousin 
Lancel
, much to
Cersei's disgust) to the courtyard, where Cersei finds herself standing close to the spot where 
Eddard Stark
 was
executed. As the Septas accompanying her announce her sins to the watching crowd, Cersei muses first on how
Joffrey
 undid all her plans and the work of 
Varys
 and 
Littlefinger
; had he done as he was told and sent Stark to 
the
Wall
, Ned and his knowledge of Cersei's incest would have been removed and the Lannisters would have had peace
with 
Robb Stark
, a hostage in the form of 
Sansa
 and the freedom to deal with 
Stannis
 and 
Renly Baratheon
, but
instead Joffrey demanded Stark's head, and after that everything fell apart. Cersei's thoughts then turn to memories
of how 
her father
 did away with her 
grandfather's
 mistress after his death, having her stripped naked and marched
through the streets of 
Lannisport
, but Cersei insists to herself she will not be broken and humiliated so easily.
Cersei is then forced to strip before the crowd and walk to the Red Keep. At first, Cersei walks with dignity,
ignoring the insults and worse (such as rotten vegetables and a cat carcass) the crowd throw at her, but as the walk
continues and the insults grow worse, mocking her faded beauty and the signs of age on her body, Cersei struggles
to maintain her composure. As she walks, Cersei begins to hallucinate, seeing faces of others in the crowd; her
father frowning, Ned and Sansa Stark, along with 
Sansa's wolf
 staring accusingly at her, 
Tyrion
 laughing at her and
finally, the face of 
Maggy the Frog
 intoning her prophecy: 
Queen you shall be, until there comes another, younger
and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold most dear
.
At this, Cersei breaks down in tears and runs for the Red Keep, collapsing as soon as she staggers into the courtyard.
Kevan Lannister orders her covered up and removed, at which point Cersei is picked up by an eight-foot-tall giant of
a man, clad in the armour and white cloak of a 
Kingsguard
 knight. 
Qyburn
 appears and introduces Cersei to his
champion, 
Ser Robert Strong
 and she is most pleased.

After this, he signs the register of the Second Sons using his own blood as ink.
After this, he is told to go and find armor for himself and 
Penny
. He returns to where she is sleeping, and there he

Jorah Mormont

random assortment of armor, which he claims is of decent quality. When Penny tells Tyrion that she dreamt that she
was jousting with her brother again, Tyrion slaps her, trying to force her to quit her mooning and to realize that they
must wear armor or likely die. Finally, Tyrion says that he will take care of making sure that the Second Sons turn
sides again, since Tyrion and Jorah both agree that they are on the losing side of the coming battle.

present would have killed the Yunkish delegation in an instant had Hizdahr given the command, raging that the
Yunkish would never have dared do such a thing to Daenerys. The Shavepate goes on to explain to Ser Barristan
that Hizdahr's horrified reaction to Groleo's severed head was a sham and the slavers couldn't care less about
Yurkhaz zo Yunzak
's death in the pit; the whole thing was arranged so as to give Hizdahr a pretext to kill the queen's
dragons
 before 
Volantis
's fleet arrives.
Despite Skahaz's objections, Barristan insists that after Hizdahr is deposed, they will order the Yunkai'i return their
remaining hostage and withdraw their armies from 
Meereen
, only going forth to do battle if they refuse. Selmy is
also confident he can overcome Hizdahr's guards, as they are only pit fighters and Barristan believes men like that,
who fight for the adulation of the crowd and only when they are called to, are no match for a knight of the
Kingsguard
 who must always be alert and ready to fight and die at a moment's notice to defend their monarch.
Barristan and Skahaz also dispute over trying to rescue the remaining hostages—
Jhogo
, 
Hero
 and 
Daario
—as the
Shavepate believes it is too dangerous to try. He is also particularly scathing about Daario, believing it would be
better in the long run for Daenerys if the 
Stormcrows
's captain were to die. Though he is aware Daenerys is in love
with Daario, Barristan privately agrees as he is well aware from history that the 
Targaryens
 have a propensity for
choosing poorly in matters of the heart, choices that almost always lead to disaster:
Prine 
Rhaegar
 loved his Lady 
Lyanna
 and 
thousands died for it
. 
Daemon Blackfyre
 loved the 
first Daenerys
,
and rose in 
rebellion
 when denied her. 
Bittersteel
 and 
Bloodraven
 both loved 
Shiera Seastar
 and the Seven
Kingdoms bled. The 
Prince of Dragonflies
 loved 
Jenny of Oldstones
 so much he cast aside a crown, and
Westeros paid the bride price in corpses. All three of the sons of the 
fifth Aegon
 had wed for love in defiance of
their father's wishes. And because that unlikely monarch had followed his heart when he chose his queen, he
allowed his sons to have their way, making bitter enemies when he might have made fast friends. Treason and
turmoil followed, as night follows day, ending at 
Summerhall
 in sorcery, fire and grief.
Skahaz also mentions that they have hostages of their own and that they can easily retaliate in kind if the Yunkai'i
harm any more of their hostages, but like his queen, Barristan refuses to harm the cupbearers, due to his own
aversion to killing children. Though disappointed, the Shavepate agrees and promises that everything will be ready
for the plan by nightfall.
For the rest of the day, Barristan makes his rounds about 
the pyramid
 and trains with his boys. He thinks to himself
that some of them might be ready for 
knighthood
 soon. However, as he wrestles with what he is planning to do that
night, he decides it would be worse for the boys if they were knighted by an knight without honour just before his
death. He lectures the boys about honor and thinks that someday maybe they will understand. He also warns
Missandei
 not to leave the queen's chambers, but refuses to answer her questions about his intentions. He also

reflects on his own failures, one in particular; that he didn't defeat Rhaegar at the 
tourney at Harrenhal
. Had he won,
he would have crowned 
Ashara Dayne
, who he was enamoured with, as 
queen of love and beauty
 and wonders that
if he had, would Ashara not have killed herself from grief over a child supposedly fathered on her by 
a Stark
.
Barristan considers that his greatest failure.
During the night, after bathing and donning his armour, Ser Barristan goes to confront Hizdahr in his chambers; the
Brazen Beasts let him past without incident. Barristan, using the pretext of delivering a message to gain entrance,
tries to question Hizdahr, demanding to know if he is in league with the 
Sons of the Harpy
 and if he had anything to
do with the 
assassination attempt
 on Daenerys. Hizdahr's denials of the accusations do not convince Selmy, and
when the old knight draws his sword, Hizdahr call for the pit fighter 
Khrazz
, one of his guards, to defend him.
Despite Barristan's efforts to convince Khrazz to surrender, the gladiator attacks him; however, Khrazz's
inexperience of fighting opponents wearing armour is his downfall, and Selmy kills him quickly. Barristan tells
Hizdahr, who desperately begs for his life, that he means to take Hizdahr to a cell, where he will be imprisoned until
Daenerys returns. Suddenly, a 
cup bearer
 informs them that 
Reznak
 wishes to see the king. Barristan, surprised as he
and Skahaz had planned to imprison Reznak as well, asks why and is told the dragons (
Viserion
 and 
Rhaegal
) have
been loosed upon the city.

Quentyn
 goes ahead with his plan to steal the dragons. With the help of the

, they make it to
the pit where 
Rhaegal
 and 
Viserion
 are kept. There, however, they use the codeword "dog" on the

who are actually part of the scheme to overthrow the king that very night. A fight ensues, and the four guards are
slain, although Quentyn is almost slain by a spear. They enter and find that Rhaegal has also broken his chains since
he was last in the pit, and that Viserion has created a cave for himself in the ceiling of the pit. Viserion is first
attracted to 
Pretty Meris
, as he is looking for Daenerys, but then tries to exit the pit. Throughout this encounter,
Quentyn tries to dominate the dragons like he had seen 
Daenerys
 do with 
Drogon
, but when he strikes Viserion with
a whip, Rhaegal spews fire on him, setting him aflame.

Synopsis
Jon
 means to lead men to 
Hardhome
 to rescue the 
wildlings
 and men of the 
Night's Watch
 trapped there. 
Queen
Selyse
 and 
Melisandre
 discourage him, and want to leave them to their fate. However, Jon is determined to lead a
rescue mission.
While planning the mission with 
Tormund Giantsbane
, Jon receives a 
letter
 from 
Ramsay Bolton
. Ramsay claims
that 
King Stannis
 is dead after a seven day battle, that he captured 
Mance Rayder
 and flayed his spear wives, and
that he wants 
his bride
 back, along with 
Theon
, 
Melisandre
, 
Val
, Mance's presumed son, and Queen Selyse and her
daughter
This changes everything, and Jon decides to send the bulk of the Night's Watch to Hardhome with Tormund in
command, while he will go to 
Winterfell
 himself and make Ramsay answer for his words. Jon knows that doing so
will break his vow to not interfere in the wars of the 
Seven Kingdoms
, so he is prepared to go alone. He asks if
anyone will ride with him and he gets an overwhelming roar of support from most of the wildlings, though not from
his Black Brothers - 
Yarwyck
 and 
Bowen Marsh
 leave the hall with their men. Jon doesn't mind as he appears to
have more than enough men to go with him and none of the Night's Watch will have to break their vows.
When Jon is on his way to inform Queen Selyse, he hears the giant 
Wun Wun
 roar and a man scream. When he
arrives, a bleeding Wun Wun is smashing dead 
Ser Patrek
 against a tower wall. Jon tries to calm the people who
come running, when 
Wick Wittlestick
 slashes at Jon's throat with a dagger, just barely grazing him. While Jon is still
trying to understand, Bowen Marsh and others plant daggers in him, all of them saying, 
"For the Watch."
 By the
time the fourth dagger slashes him, Jon passes out.

Daenerys X
Synopsis
It is raining heavily in Meereen, for which 
Barristan Selmy
 is grateful; otherwise the fires caused during 
Viserion
and 
Rhaegal
's rampage might have consumed the entire city. There is no sign of the two 
dragons
: they do not like
the rain any more than men. 
Quentyn Martell
 is dead; it took three days for him to die. Out of respect for the prince,
Ser Barristan had him placed in 
the queen's
 bed, the same one he crossed half the world to reach. 
Missandei
 is the
only one he could get to help tend Quentyn, for none of the cupbearers were willing and the 
Blue Graces
 never
responded to his summons; he suspects the 
pale mare
 has carried them off. Missandei asks what is to be done with
Quentyn's body and Barristan replies that they will find a way to send him back to 
Dorne
, though he is unsure how.
He advises Missandei to get some sleep and she urges him to do the same as she has noted that he doesn't sleep very
much. Barristan privately thinks it is not just needing less sleep than a younger man, as 
Grand Maester
 
Pycelle
 once
told him, but having reached the age where he fears to close his eyes in case he never opens them again; Barristan
does not consider dying in his sleep a death worthy of a knight of the 
Kingsguard
. For a brief moment, he wonders if
Daenerys is dead, but then dismisses the thought, though he notes that each time it becomes harder to convince
himself his queen is still alive.
At dawn, 
Skahaz mo Kandaq
 comes to speak with him; Skahaz is already aware that Quentyn is dead, and he
informs Barristan that the 
Green Grace
, who Barristan sent to treat with the 
Yunkai'i
 to make them release the
hostages, has not returned to the city. In addition, while the city is secure, an angry mob is gathered outside the
pyramid demanding 
Hizdahr
's release and that both dragons be destroyed, and since his arrest, the 
Sons of the Harpy
have resumed their nightly murders with a vengeance; Barristan is shocked to learn they have killed twenty nine in
the night, in contrast to nine the previous night and three the night before. However, despite Skahaz's insistence,
Barristan still refuses to kill the hostages in retaliation.
The Shavepate tells Barristan (who is now the Queen's 
Hand
, as head of a council ruling the city) that the council is
waiting for him. Barristan does not want the position, but in the absence of Daenerys, he doesn't trust any of the
others to rule. 
Grey Worm
 and the captains of the 
Stalwart Shields
, 
Mother's Men
 and 
Free Brothers
, along with
Strong Belwas
 are present. Barristan informs them of Quentyn's death; most of the council express contempt for the
prince's actions and many want his companions, who are at present imprisoned, executed for unleashing the dragons
on the city. The fighting pits are to remain closed, for fear that the noise and smell of blood will attract the dragons,
though 
Marselen
 suggests reopening the pits in the hope it lures 
Drogon
 back, and Daenerys with him. For the time
being, the pits are packed full of livestock, from which the dragons are feeding regularly, and thus far, there has
been no further evidence of either Viserion or Rhaegal eating people.
The council are convinced that the Yunkai'i are never going to accept any terms beside the killing of both dragons
for the return of the hostages. When asked what he will do when his terms are refused, Barristan replies "Fire and
Blood". They quickly grasp his meaning; he intends to do battle with the Yunkish army. A lengthy discussion
regarding the battle plan follows, particularly regarding the deployment of troops, targets to attack, how best to use
the 
Unsullied
 and other such concerns; however, all agree that if they can destroy the slavers, the 
sellsword
companies will abandon their paymasters, and the dragons may make their presence known in the fight, though
Barristan cannot say if they will help or just kill indiscriminately, though he does note that if they come, it will help

break Yunkish morale.
When the council adjourns, Barristan goes to the cell where the two Dornishmen are being held and informs them of
Prince Quentyn's death. 
Gerris Drinkwater
 angrily blames Daenerys for it, causing a fierce argument between him
and Barristan, who bluntly dismisses Gerris's claims Quentyn came for love and asserts they came because
Quentyn's father
 wanted the backing of 
House Targaryen
 before daring to defy the 
Iron Throne
, but 
Archibald
Yronwood
 angrily tells Gerris to shut up before more can be said. Barristan then makes an arrangement with the two
Dornishmen
; in exchange for a ship back to Dorne and Quentyn's bones to return to his father, Barristan wants them
to go back to the 
Windblown
 company and tell the 
Tattered Prince
 that they will give him what he wants (namely
Pentos
) if he can free and protect the hostages during the attack.
The Green Grace returns, telling Barristan that the Yunkai'i have refused his offer, and that the only price they will
accept is the death of the dragons. As they speak, the Shavepate runs in and tells them that the six trebuchets have
begun flinging not rocks, but corpses into 
Meereen
.

Synopsis
Daenerys
 is walking back south through the 
Dothraki Sea
 towards 
Meereen
, following a small rivulet that she thinks
will flow into the 
Skahazadhan
. She has spent her time flying 
Drogon
, but could not make him take her back.
Instead, they have been staying at his lair, a small cave in a hill she named 
Dragonstone
 as a reference to 
the place
where she was born
. She gets sick on the way, and has a number of hallucinations as she lies in the grass, bleeding
and dying. These include a vision of 
Quaithe
, of 
Viserys Targaryen
, and of 
Jorah Mormont
, and seem to revolve
around the idea of forgetting who she is.
Finally, a single 
Dothraki
 scout approaches her, but does not see her. The scout freezes as Drogon approaches, and
then flees. Daenerys calls out for Drogon as he flies over, and mounts him. Drogon catches and devours a horse, and
Dany joins him. This is how 
Khal Jhaqo
, former 
ko
 of Khal 
Drogo
, accompanied by 50 of his warriors, finds her.

Epilogue
Synopsis
Lord Regent 
Kevan Lannister
 is hosting a small council meeting in the 
Red Keep
's throne room; neither Queen
Margaery
 nor 
Cersei
 are present, nor is 
Tommen
, as Kevan thinks it kinder to let him spend as much time as
possible with his mother before her trial and possible execution. The lord of 
Griffin's Roost
, 
Ronnet Connington
stands before them, insisting that he is loyal to King Tommen and uninvolved with whoever claims to be his uncle
Jon Connington
 and the 
Targaryen
 pretender he has brought with him, who have landed with the 
Golden Company
in the 
Stormlands
, attacking towns and villages as they march on 
Storm's End
. Ronnet begs to prove his loyalty in
battle, but the new 
Hand of the King
 
Mace Tyrell
 refuses, and orders Ronnet kept in his quarters for the moment, in
addition to sending the men-at-arms 
Jaime
 sent to accompany Connington south - all former 
thugs
 of 
Gregor
Clegane
's - to the 
Night's Watch
.
Kevan has begun to resent the demands of Mace Tyrell as Cersei did, but he realises he cannot openly oppose them;
Tyrell and his bannerman 
Randyll Tarly
 have both brought armies to 
King's Landing
, while the Lannisters' standing
army is still in the 
Riverlands
. Tyrell insists that he will deal with Connington and his boy after Margaery's trial, but
both he and Tarly show much reluctance about it; Kevan however chides them. Tyrell then asks why Tommen can't
declare Margaery's innocence without a trial, but Kevan insists that defying the Faith will send them straight into the
arms of Connington or 
Stannis Baratheon
 at a time when the 
Ironborn
 are attacking the Western lands as well. Mace
Tyrell retorts that 
Paxter Redwyne
 will drive the Ironmen back and that Stannis has to face both 
Roose Bolton
 and
the cold climate of the North. He also dismisses the threat Jon Connington and the exiles of the 
Golden Company
pose but Kevan is unsure; he still remembers when 
Aerys
 appointed Connington to the role of Hand, and while
Tywin Lannister
's assessment of Connington as unsuitable for the post proved true after his failure to kill 
Robert
Baratheon
 at the 
Battle of the Bells
, Kevan believes age has surely made Connington wiser, more cautious and more
dangerous.
The small council all agree that Connington and his pretender must be crushed, lest 
Daenerys Targaryen
 receive
word and leave 
Meereen
 to join forces with them. 
Pycelle
 suggests that they buy off the Golden Company, but new
Master of Coin
 
Harys Swyft
 dismisses this idea; thanks to Cersei's economic mismanagement, the treasury is nearly
empty, the 
Iron Bank of Braavos
 still demanding its money, pledges for new loans from 
Myr
 received no favorable
response, and their hopes of replenishing the treasuries with the fabled wealth on 
Dragonstone
 following 
Ser Loras's
capture of the island have proven in vain. Mace Tyrell reacts angrily to that, arguing that Loras searched the castle
and found no trace of gold or gemstones, nor the fabled cache of 
dragon eggs
 supposedly kept there; Kevan
personally thinks that Loras didn't look very hard, given that he is a young man prone to rash judgments, even more
so following his injuries, and the 
Valyrian
 sorcery used to construct Dragonstone likely hides many secrets, but
Kevan defuses the argument by suggesting Stannis likely took everything of value with him when he fled. Kevan
also suggests that Harys try 
Pentoshi
 
magister
 moneylenders, or else go to Braavos and deal with the Iron Bank in
person.
Next, business turns to the forthcoming trials; Kevan says that Cersei has chosen 
trial by battle
, with Ser 
Robert
Strong
 to represent her as her champion. Tyrell and Tarly express deep misgivings about the man, which Kevan
shares as they have all heard rumours: 
Meryn Trant
 says he has never seen Strong eat or drink, and 
Boros Blount
claims to have never seen him use the privy. Kevan muses that 
"Dead men don't shit"
, suspecting that he and the
others know 
who Strong really is
. However, Kevan silences Mace's protests by arguing that if Cersei loses her trial,
the legitimacy of her children, and thus Margaery's claim to the throne as Tommen's queen will be called into
question. He also assures the council that even if Cersei proves her innocence, she will be sent back to 
Casterly
Rock
 afterwards, and play no further part in ruling or Tommen's education.

The meeting adjourns, intending to reconvene in five days' time and leaving for later decisions about an inheritance
involving 
House Rosby
 and six claims, as well as the preparation for 
Myrcella
's upcoming marriage. Mace Tyrell
makes plain his scorn for the marriage, particularly after Myrcella's injuries, and suggests a better match for her;
Kevan muses that Mace likely has his son 
Willas
 in mind. He dismisses the idea, warning that reneging on
Myrcella's betrothal now could be all the cause 
Doran Martell
 needs to side with Connington. Harys Swyft suggests
that they get the Dornish to deal with Connington and his pretender; Kevan agrees that it would save them a lot of
trouble. After Tyrell and Tarly are gone, Pycelle asks Kevan for guards, fearing that Mace Tyrell means to do him
harm for his part in Cersei's claims about Margaery, but Kevan dismisses his concerns.
It is snowing heavily in King's Landing and Kevan retires to his study for a time to warm up. He muses on the
possibility of raising his son 
Lancel
 to the Kingsguard to end his newfound piety, before his thoughts turn to Cersei,
the charming and sweet girl once was; he believes that, had Aerys accepted Tywin's offer and wed his son to Cersei,
Rhaegar
 would never have looked twice at 
Lyanna Stark
, and perhaps many now dead would still be alive. He then
thinks on Cersei's 
walk of shame
 and how similar it was to what Tywin did to their 
father's
 
mistress
, but Kevan
reassures himself it was necessary; the Faith had to be appeased, and left unchecked, Cersei would have corrupted
Tommen as she did 
Joffrey
.
Kevan then goes to Cersei's chambers, where he has dinner with her and Tommen. Cersei is very calm and guarded
after her walk of atonement, which Kevan thinks a good sign. She makes a humble request that 
Taena Merryweather
attend on her once more after the trial and that her son be brought to court as a companion for Tommen; she also
asks after her brothers, but Kevan has no news of Jaime or Tyrion. He also says that he has imprisoned the
remaining Kettleblack brothers for their crimes of fornicating with a Queen; if they confess, he will send them to the
Wall. If not, they will face Robert Strong.
A messenger then announces that Grand Maester Pycelle is asking for Kevan's presence. Kevan arrives at the
Maester's chambers and enters to find a 
white raven
 sitting on the window ledge, a sign from the 
Citadel
 that winter
has come. Kevan turns to leave, and is hit in the chest by a crossbow bolt. He calls out for help, but then sees Pycelle
sat at his table, already dead. For one moment, Kevan calls out to 
Tyrion
, thinking his nephew responsible, but a
familiar voice tells him otherwise as the real killer emerges: 
Varys
. Varys explains to the dying Kevan that he bears
the man no ill will, that Kevan is simply a good man in service to a bad cause, but he was becoming too successful
in uniting the realm behind Tommen and undoing the damage Cersei had caused. The eunuch adds that Cersei will
suspect the Tyrells (with help from the Imp) for Kevan's murder, the Tyrells will blame her, someone will blame the
Dornish and the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the 
Iron Throne
 will crumble as 
Aegon
 makes his presence
known at Storm's End and the realm flocks to the side of the Targaryens.
Kevan insists that Aegon was killed during the 
Sack of King's Landing
 but Varys explains otherwise; that Aegon has
been groomed since birth to be king, taught not just in skill at arms and ruling, but how to look after himself, what it
means to go hungry, to be hunted and most importantly, that it is his 
duty
 to rule, not his right, and to put his people
first. Varys then summons some of his "
little birds
" and instructs them to finish the dying Kevan off.
