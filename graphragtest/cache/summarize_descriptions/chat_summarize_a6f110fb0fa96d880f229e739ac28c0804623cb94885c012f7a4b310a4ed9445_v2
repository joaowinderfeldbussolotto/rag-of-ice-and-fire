As one of Lord Walder Frey’s sons, he accompanies Catelyn Stark during her time at the Twins, showcasing his involvement in key political and familial matters. Hosteen is recognized by Theon Greyjoy, indicating his notable presence within the Frey household.\n\nDuring the infamous Red Wedding, Hosteen Frey plays a direct role in the massacre by killing Lucas Blackwood, demonstrating his willingness to engage in violence to further his family’s interests. His actions reflect the ruthless reputation of House Frey during this event.\n\nHosteen is also deeply concerned about the disappearance of Frey men, suggesting a sense of loyalty and protectiveness toward his kin. However, his distress does not temper his aggressive tendencies. He openly accuses the Manderlys of being responsible for the death of Little Walder Frey, a claim that escalates tensions and leads to violent conflict. His confrontational approach underscores his role as an enforcer of House Frey’s interests, often through force rather than diplomacy.\n\nOverall, Hosteen Frey is a complex figure—loyal to his family but prone to aggression, willing to take drastic measures to defend or advance House Frey’s position, even at the cost of escalating hostilities with other noble houses.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075874, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 501, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
