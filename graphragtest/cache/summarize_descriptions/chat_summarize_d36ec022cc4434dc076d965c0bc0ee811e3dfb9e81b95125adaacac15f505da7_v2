The city is deeply tied to the Manderly family, who govern it with authority and play a crucial role in the region's affairs.\n\nWhite Harbor is also a key destination in the political and military intrigues of the North. Davos Seaworth is held captive in the New Castle within the city, where he is later imprisoned and becomes entangled in the local political machinations. He arrives in White Harbor aboard the *Merry Midwife* and observes the *Lionstar* warship, highlighting the city's naval importance. Stannis Baratheon considers seizing White Harbor for its resources, and Davos is ordered to sail north to post Stannis's declaration there, underscoring its strategic value.\n\nBeyond its political and military significance, White Harbor is a cultural and economic hub. Lord Wyman Manderly is known for bringing seafood from the city to feasts, showcasing its prosperity and maritime trade. The city is also a potential refuge for Osha, who plans to take Rickon Stark and Shaggydog there, emphasizing its role as a place of safety and connection to the Stark family.\n\nAs part of the Stark lands, White Harbor remains a vital location in the North, intertwined with the fate of House Stark and the broader conflicts of Westeros.
