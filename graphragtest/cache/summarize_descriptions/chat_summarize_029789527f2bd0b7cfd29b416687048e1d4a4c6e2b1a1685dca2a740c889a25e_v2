The house is prominently associated with key figures such as Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure Tully, who play significant roles in the political and military affairs of Westeros. House Tully's banners are flown at Riverrun, symbolizing their authority and influence in the region.\n\nThe Tullys have strong ties to House Stark through marriage, particularly with Catelyn Stark (n√©e Tully), who is the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, the former head of the house. This alliance has drawn House Tully into major conflicts, including the War of the Five Kings, where they have been involved in political discussions and military engagements. Their forces, however, have faced setbacks, notably suffering defeat at the hands of Jaime Lannister.\n\nHouse Tully commands the loyalty of several bannermen, including House Frey, whose allegiance is sworn to them, though this relationship has been fraught with tension. The Freys, led by Lord Walder Frey, are among the most powerful vassals of House Tully, though their loyalty has been tested by the events of war and shifting political alliances.\n\nRiverrun, the formidable stronghold of House Tully, has been a focal point of defense and conflict, with the family striving to protect their lands and people. The house has also been petitioned by their bannermen regarding raids on their territories, highlighting their role as protectors of the Riverlands. Despite challenges, House Tully remains a resilient and influential noble house, deeply entwined in the power struggles of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749074146, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 336, "prompt_tokens": 373, "total_tokens": 709, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
