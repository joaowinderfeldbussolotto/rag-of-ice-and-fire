However, in recent times, the house has taken a distinct path. Unlike many other northern houses, House Karstark has gone south and is not actively participating in the current political or military events unfolding in the North. This departure from the region marks a significant shift in their traditional role and alliances.\n\nDespite their withdrawal from northern affairs, House Karstark stands out as the only house to have declared allegiance to Stannis Baratheon, a claimant to the Iron Throne. This declaration sets them apart from other northern houses, which have largely remained loyal to the Starks or other factions. The reasons behind their allegiance to Stannis are not fully detailed, but it underscores their willingness to break from conventional loyalties and pursue their own political interests.\n\nThe house's actions reflect a complex and evolving stance in the broader conflicts of Westeros, balancing between detachment from northern conflicts and a strategic, if isolated, allegiance to Stannis. Their current position suggests a house navigating its own path amid the turmoil of the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076279, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
