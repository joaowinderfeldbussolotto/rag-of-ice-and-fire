Deeply concerned about Bran’s condition following his fall and subsequent coma, Catelyn remains vigilant in safeguarding him from further harm. Her protective instincts are evident when she defends Bran from an assassin sent to silence him, reinforcing her unwavering dedication to his safety.\n\nBeyond her maternal instincts, Catelyn plays a strategic role in the political landscape of Westeros. She shares Bran’s story with Renly Baratheon, aiming to expose the Lannisters’ involvement in the attempt on his life.
