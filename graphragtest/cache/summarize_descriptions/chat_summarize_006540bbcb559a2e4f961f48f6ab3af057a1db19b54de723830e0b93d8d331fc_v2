Taena serves as a confidante to Cersei, offering her support and companionship during tumultuous times. Following Cersei’s trial, she specifically requests Taena’s presence to attend to her, underscoring the trust and reliance she places in her. Taena’s loyalty is further demonstrated when she pledges to assist Cersei in locating her estranged brother, Tyrion Lannister, highlighting her commitment to Cersei’s causes.\n\nHowever, Taena’s allegiance is not without its complexities. Despite her initial devotion, she eventually flees to Longtable, the seat of House Merryweather, leaving Cersei behind. The reasons for her departure remain unclear, but it marks a significant shift in their relationship. Whether driven by self-preservation, shifting loyalties, or other unseen factors, Taena’s actions add a layer of intrigue to her character and her connection with Cersei.
