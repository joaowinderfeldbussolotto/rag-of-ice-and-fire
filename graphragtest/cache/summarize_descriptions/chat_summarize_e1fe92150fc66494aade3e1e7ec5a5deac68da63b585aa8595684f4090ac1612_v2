The family rules from Highgarden, their ancestral seat, and is renowned for its wealth, political acumen, and strategic alliances. The golden rose is their prominent sigil, symbolizing their noble heritage and prominence in the realm.\n\nKey members of House Tyrell include Loras Tyrell, a skilled knight, and Margaery Tyrell, a cunning and ambitious woman who plays a significant role in the political landscape of Westeros. The house is deeply involved in the power struggles of the Seven Kingdoms, often leveraging marriage alliances to strengthen their position. At one point, they are speculated to support Viserys Targaryen’s claim to the Iron Throne, showcasing their adaptability in shifting political tides.\n\nHouse Tyrell’s influence is further highlighted by their involvement in Renly Baratheon’s camp, where their sigil is prominently displayed, indicating their support for his claim to the throne. Additionally, Tyrion Lannister suggests recruiting House Tyrell to bolster Joffrey Baratheon’s cause, underscoring their value as allies. The family also seeks to marry Sansa Stark, aiming to secure her claim to Winterfell and further expand their influence in the North.\n\nDespite the complexities of their political maneuvering, House Tyrell remains a formidable force in Westeros, balancing ambition with pragmatism.
