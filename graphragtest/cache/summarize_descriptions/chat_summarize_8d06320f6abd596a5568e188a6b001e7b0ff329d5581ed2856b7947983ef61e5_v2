She is one of the oldest people in the Seven Kingdoms, having outlived most of her family, and is a cherished figure in the Stark household. Old Nan is particularly close to Bran Stark, to whom she recounts stories about the Stark family’s \"wolf blood,\" wildlings, ghosts, dungeons, and the mythical children of the forest. She also shares tales with Arya Stark, particularly about Harrenhal and its haunted history.\n\nHer storytelling encompasses a wide range of subjects, including the Others and their destructive nature, wargs, the Boltons, and other legendary figures. Old Nan is also known for her eerie foresight, as she claims to smell the comet and foretells the return of dragons. Despite her age, she remains an active presence at feasts and gatherings in Winterfell, where her stories captivate listeners.\n\nOld Nan plays a supportive role in the Stark family, offering comfort to Catelyn Stark after an attack and providing wisdom through her tales. She affectionately refers to Jojen Reed as \"little grandfather,\" reflecting her warm and familiar demeanor. Her stories serve not only as entertainment but also as a means of preserving history and warning of forgotten dangers. Old Nan’s presence in Winterfell is a reminder of the past, and her narratives often carry deeper truths about the world beyond the castle walls.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749059852, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 310, "prompt_tokens": 484, "total_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
