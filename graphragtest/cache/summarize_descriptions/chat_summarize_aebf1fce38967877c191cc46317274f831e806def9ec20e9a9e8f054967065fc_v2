They rule from their ancestral seat, Winterfell, and their sigil is a direwolf. The house is central to many political and military events, including the War of the Five Kings, where they opposed House Lannister.\n\nLed by Eddard \"Ned\" Stark at the beginning of the conflict, House Stark includes prominent members such as his children—Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon—as well as Jon Snow, Ned’s presumed bastard son, and Catelyn Stark, Ned’s wife by marriage. The family is also tied to Arya Stark, whose highborn status is emphasized by her lineage. Robb Stark later assumes leadership of the house after Ned’s death, playing a crucial role in the war.\n\nHouse Stark’s influence extends beyond their immediate family, as they have fostered alliances, including with House Bracken, which once sided with them, leading to conflicts with the crown. They are also connected to the infamous Red Wedding, a pivotal event where their alliance with House Frey was betrayed, resulting in devastating consequences for the family.\n\nThe Starks are known for their strong ties to the North, their unwavering sense of justice, and their role in guarding the realm. Their involvement in key political and military discussions underscores their significance in the broader struggles of Westeros. Despite facing numerous hardships, House Stark remains a symbol of resilience and nobility in the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749059924, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 586, "total_tokens": 905, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
