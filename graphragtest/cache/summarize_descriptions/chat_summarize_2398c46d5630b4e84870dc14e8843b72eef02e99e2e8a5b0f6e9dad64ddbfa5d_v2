As a key figure in the region, he plays a significant role in the power struggles unfolding in Slaver's Bay. The Windblown, under his command, is a formidable sellsword company that has been known to serve Yunkai, aligning with the city's interests in its conflicts.\n\nThe Tattered Prince is a pragmatic and strategic leader, often sought after for alliances due to the strength and influence of his company. He is notably approached by Quentyn Martell, who seeks to form an alliance with the Windblown, highlighting the prince's importance in the broader political maneuvers of the time. Additionally, he is a central figure in discussions with Daenerys Targaryen, who considers allying with the Windblown. The Tattered Prince demands Pentos as a condition for joining Daenerys, demonstrating his ambition and the high stakes of his involvement in the region's conflicts.\n\nIn another instance, the Tattered Prince is offered Pentos in exchange for protecting hostages, further illustrating his role as a negotiator and a leader capable of leveraging his position for significant gains. His actions and decisions reflect the complex and often shifting loyalties of mercenary companies in the world of Westeros and Essos, where power, wealth, and survival are constantly at play.\n\nOverall, the Tattered Prince is a cunning and influential leader whose decisions have far-reaching implications for the balance of power in Meereen and beyond.
