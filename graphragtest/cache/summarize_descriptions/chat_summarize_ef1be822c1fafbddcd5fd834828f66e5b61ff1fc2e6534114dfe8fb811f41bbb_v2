As a bloodrider, Qotho holds a position of high honor within Drogo's khalasar, serving as both a protector and an enforcer of the khal's will. He is particularly vocal in questioning Daenerys' decisions, reflecting the broader skepticism among the Dothraki toward her influence over Drogo.\n\nQotho plays a significant role in the events surrounding Drogo's injury and the subsequent search for healing. When Drogo falls ill, Qotho is among those commanded to find Mirri Maz Duur, the godswife, though he remains distrustful of her. His hostility toward Mirri Maz Duur is evident, as he reminds her of her fate, hinting at the consequences she may face if her efforts fail. This tension culminates in a violent confrontation when Qotho fights Ser Jorah Mormont, leaving the knight wounded in the struggle.\n\nUltimately, Qotho's life is sacrificed in an attempt to save Drogo, underscoring his unwavering dedication to his khal. His actions and attitudes reflect the brutal and honor-bound culture of the Dothraki, where loyalty to the khal is paramount, and outsiders like Daenerys and Mirri Maz Duur are viewed with deep suspicion. Qotho's story is one of fierce allegiance, conflict, and the harsh realities of life within a Dothraki khalasar.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066980, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
