This union took place under emotionally charged circumstances, as Jeyne’s care and compassion played a significant role in Robb’s recovery. However, the marriage also carried profound political consequences, as it led Robb to break his prior pledge to marry a daughter of House Frey, a powerful and strategic alliance forged during the War of the Five Kings. This breach of promise severely strained relations with House Frey, ultimately contributing to the infamous betrayal at the Red Wedding, where Robb and his forces were ambushed and slaughtered. Jeyne Westerling, though initially a figure of solace for Robb, became entangled in the political fallout of his decision, marking their marriage as a pivotal yet tragic turning point in the conflict.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749083186, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 379, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
