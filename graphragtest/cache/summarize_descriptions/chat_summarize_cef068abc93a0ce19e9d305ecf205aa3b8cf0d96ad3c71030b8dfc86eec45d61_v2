Tyrion leverages his knowledge of Lancel's secret relationship with Cersei, using it as a threat to ensure Lancel's compliance. By manipulating Lancel and exploiting his vulnerabilities, Tyrion successfully turns him into an informant, furthering his own political agenda within the Lannister family. Lancel, driven by fear of exposure and the potential consequences of his actions, reluctantly agrees to serve as Tyrion's spy, providing crucial information about Cersei's activities and intentions.
