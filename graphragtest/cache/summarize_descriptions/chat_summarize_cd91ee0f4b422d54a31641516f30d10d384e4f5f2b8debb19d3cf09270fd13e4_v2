He is a hedge knight who consorts with Cersei, assisting her in raising sellswords and executing her schemes. Cersei appoints him to command the Kingsguard in Jaime Lannister’s absence, though his reputation within the order is questionable. As a member of the Kingsguard, Osmund is deeply involved in Cersei’s political maneuvering, often delivering news to her and acting on her behalf.\n\nOsmund plays a key role in Cersei’s more sinister plans, including the killing of gaolers on her orders. Alongside Boros Blount, he carries out these acts, though they are later reprimanded by Jaime Lannister for their actions. Despite his controversial methods, Osmund remains a loyal servant to Cersei, standing by her side even as the Tower of the Hand burns. His involvement in Cersei’s affairs extends to informing her about the movements of guards and secret passages, further cementing his role as a trusted, if morally ambiguous, agent of her will. His actions reflect both his allegiance to Cersei and the questionable nature of his service within the Kingsguard.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076615, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 358, "total_tokens": 616, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
