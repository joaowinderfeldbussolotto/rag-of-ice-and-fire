Despite this abandonment, Lancel was later granted the lands of House Darry, suggesting a complex relationship between the two entities. The reasons behind Lancel's initial departure and subsequent acquisition of the Darry lands are not fully detailed, but the sequence of events indicates a shift in power or ownership. This transfer of lands may have been a political or strategic decision, possibly aimed at consolidating influence or rewarding loyalty. The exact nature of Lancel's connection to House Darry—whether through familial ties, political alliances, or other means—remains unclear, but the outcome solidified his control over the territory once associated with Darry.
