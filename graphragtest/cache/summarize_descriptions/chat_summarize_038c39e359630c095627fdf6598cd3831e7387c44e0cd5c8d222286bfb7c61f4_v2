She was the sister of Doran Martell and Oberyn Martell, both prominent figures in Dorne. Elia was murdered during the Sack of King's Landing, an event that marked the violent end of Robert's Rebellion and the fall of House Targaryen. Her death was carried out by the Lannisters, specifically by Ser Gregor Clegane, under the orders of Tywin Lannister, though the exact circumstances remain a point of deep contention between the Lannisters and the Martells.\n\nElia's murder was particularly brutal, as she was not only killed but also subjected to further atrocities, including the murder of her young children, Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen. This act of violence fueled a long-standing feud between House Martell and House Lannister, with Doran Martell harboring a deep desire for vengeance. Her death became a symbol of the injustices suffered by Dorne and a rallying point for those seeking retribution against the Lannisters.\n\nElia's legacy is one of sorrow and unresolved conflict, as her murder continued to influence the political landscape of Westeros long after her death. Her brother Oberyn Martell, in particular, sought justice for her, though his efforts ultimately led to his own demise. Elia Martell remains a poignant figure in the history of Dorne, remembered for her noble lineage and the tragic circumstances of her end.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749070785, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 567, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
