As a septa, she was responsible for Sansa's education in matters of faith, etiquette, and the expectations placed upon a highborn lady. Mordane often provided counsel to Sansa, including advising her not to question her father, Lord Eddard Stark's decisions, reinforcing the importance of obedience and respect within their household.\n\nDespite her role as a trusted mentor, Septa Mordane met a tragic end when she was executed as a traitor. The circumstances surrounding her death remain tied to the political turmoil of the time, reflecting the brutal consequences of the power struggles in Westeros.
