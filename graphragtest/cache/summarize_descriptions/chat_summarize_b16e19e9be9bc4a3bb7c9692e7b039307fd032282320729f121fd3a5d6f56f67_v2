Theon Greyjoy, originally from the Iron Islands, has been raised alongside Robb Stark, fostering a strong bond between them. As a northern lord, Theon supports Robb Stark’s leadership and military campaigns, demonstrating loyalty to his adopted family. However, their relationship takes a significant turn when Robb Stark sends Theon Greyjoy back to the Iron Islands, likely for strategic or political reasons.
