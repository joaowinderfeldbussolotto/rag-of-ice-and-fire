As a prominent family in the Riverlands, they are known for their loyalty and military contributions. During the War of the Five Kings, House Mallister pledged their forces to Robb Stark, King in the North, demonstrating their allegiance to the Stark cause. Despite their noble standing and martial prowess, the Mallisters lack the strength to stand alone against larger or more powerful factions, necessitating alliances with other houses to maintain their influence and security. Their seat, Seagard, serves as a strategic stronghold, further emphasizing their importance in the region.
