Initially captured, she is now being transported to Harrenhal as a prisoner, though her journey could also be described as forced travel under duress. Harrenhal, known for its dark history and imposing structure, serves as a significant location in the ongoing conflicts of Westeros. Arya’s arrival at Harrenhal marks a critical point in her journey, as she navigates the dangers and uncertainties of her captivity while continuing to adapt and survive in a hostile environment.
