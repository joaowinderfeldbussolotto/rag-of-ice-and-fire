It took place at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, orchestrated by Lord Walder Frey in collaboration with House Bolton. The massacre was a calculated act of betrayal, where Robb Stark, his mother Catelyn Tully, and many of their bannermen were brutally murdered under the guise of guest right, violating the sacred laws of hospitality. The event marked a turning point in the war, devastating House Stark and their allies, while solidifying the treacherous reputation of both House Frey and House Bolton.
