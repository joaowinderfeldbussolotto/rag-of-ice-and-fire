It is most notably used in the forging of legendary weapons, including the sword Longclaw. This particular blade was given to Jon Snow by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, signifying its importance and prestige. Valyrian steel is highly prized for its durability, sharpness, and distinctive appearance, often featuring intricate patterns and a unique, almost magical resilience. The material's origins trace back to the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and its secrets of creation have been lost over time, making existing Valyrian steel weapons extremely valuable and sought after.
