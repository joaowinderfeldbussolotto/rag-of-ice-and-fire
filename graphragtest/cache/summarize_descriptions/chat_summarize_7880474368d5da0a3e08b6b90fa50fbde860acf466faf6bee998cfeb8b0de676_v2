Known for his striking white fur and eerie appearance, Ghost stands out among the other direwolves due to his silent and mysterious nature. Unlike his littermates, Ghost is often described as quiet and observant, traits that align with Jon Snow’s own character. Throughout the story, Ghost is treated as a distinct entity, playing a crucial role in Jon’s adventures and serving as a loyal protector.\n\nWhile there is a separate reference to \"GHOST\" as a renamed ship captured by the Iron Fleet, this appears to be unrelated to Jon Snow’s direwolf. The primary and consistent context for \"GHOST\" in the provided descriptions pertains to the direwolf, making it the central focus of this summary.
