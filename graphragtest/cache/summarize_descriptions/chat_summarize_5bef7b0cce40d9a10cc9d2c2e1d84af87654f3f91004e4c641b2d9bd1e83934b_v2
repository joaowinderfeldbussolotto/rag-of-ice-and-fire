She played a significant role in Robb Stark's life by nursing him back to health during a critical time, demonstrating her care and devotion. Despite her family's modest standing, her actions earned her a place in Robb's life and heart. Notably, Grey Wind, Robb Stark's direwolf, is said to have feared her, adding an intriguing layer to her character. Her marriage to Robb Stark, though born out of love and gratitude, had far-reaching political consequences, as it contributed to the breaking of a crucial alliance and altered the course of the War of the Five Kings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077167, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
