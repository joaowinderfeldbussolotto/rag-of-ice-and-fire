It is characterized by the presence of a heart tree, a weirwood tree with a carved face, symbolizing its spiritual significance. The Godswood in Winterfell is a serene and revered space where members of House Stark and others seek solace, prayer, and reflection.\n\nBran Stark frequently visits the Godswood in Winterfell, finding comfort and clarity there, especially during times of distress. It is where he interacts with Meera and Jojen Reed and reflects on his experiences. The grove is also a place where the Stark children, including Arya and Sansa, pray and connect with their faith. Ned Stark often sought solace in the Godswood, and it was where he and his daughters prayed for Bran’s recovery after his fall. Robb Stark, too, used the Godswood for prayer and even executed Rickard Karstark there, demonstrating its dual role as a place of both worship and justice.\n\nThe Godswood is also associated with significant events, such as the wedding of certain characters and Sansa Stark’s secret meetings with Dontos Hollard. It is a place where Catelyn Stark reflects on childhood memories and where Robb prays with his bannermen, even in locations like Riverrun. The direwolves of House Stark were once confined within the Godswood, reinforcing its connection to the Stark family and their traditions.\n\nBeyond Winterfell, other Godswoods exist, such as the one in Harrenhal, which spans 20 acres and serves as a place of refuge and practice for characters like Arya Stark. Theon Greyjoy also visits the Godswood to pray, highlighting its importance to various individuals. The Walders, however, are warned to stay out of the Godswood, emphasizing its exclusivity and sacredness to those who revere the Old Gods.\n\nOverall, the Godswood is a multifaceted location—sacred, historical, and deeply tied to the spiritual and personal lives of those who worship the Old Gods, particularly the Starks. It is a place of worship, reflection, and pivotal moments in the lives of its visitors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749060034, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 472, "prompt_tokens": 725, "total_tokens": 1197, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
