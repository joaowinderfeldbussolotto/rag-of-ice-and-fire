This organization is responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the law within the city. Under the leadership of Janos Slynt, the Gold Cloaks operate as a crucial arm of the city's governance, ensuring security and stability.\n\nThe City Watch plays a significant role in the political and social dynamics of King's Landing. Notably, they act on the orders of influential figures, such as Petyr Baelish, as evidenced by their detention of Catelyn Stark at his behest. This highlights the organization's involvement in high-profile arrests and its responsiveness to the commands of powerful officials.\n\nAs both a law enforcement body and a military force, the Gold Cloaks are integral to the functioning of King's Landing, balancing their duties between everyday policing and more complex, politically charged operations.
