Based in King’s Landing, they play a central role in the conflicts and power struggles that define the realm. The family is often distrusted by other noble houses, including the Starks, with whom they share a long-standing and bitter rivalry. Sansa Stark, in particular, harbors deep distrust toward the Lannisters due to their past actions against her family.\n\nThe Lannisters are frequently mentioned in the context of pivotal events, such as the battle for King’s Landing and the release of Jaime Lannister, a prominent member of the family. Their strategic maneuvers and military prowess make them a formidable force in the ongoing conflicts within the Seven Kingdoms. Despite their power, their reputation is marred by a legacy of ruthlessness and manipulation, further fueling tensions with other noble houses.
