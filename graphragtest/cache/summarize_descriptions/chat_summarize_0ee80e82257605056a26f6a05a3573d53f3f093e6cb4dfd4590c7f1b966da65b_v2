He is an ally of the Night’s Watch, though his reputation is marred by his treatment of his family and his unorthodox practices. Craster hosts the Night’s Watch survivors at his keep, providing them shelter despite his contentious relationship with the organization.\n\nHe is infamous for his multiple wives, including Gilly, and his brutal treatment of them. Craster’s most disturbing practice involves sacrificing his sons to the gods, a custom that further tarnishes his standing. Despite his alliance with the Night’s Watch, his actions and beliefs often place him at odds with their values. His role as a host to the Watch’s survivors underscores his complex position—both a necessary ally and a morally ambiguous figure in the harsh lands beyond the Wall.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749071108, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
