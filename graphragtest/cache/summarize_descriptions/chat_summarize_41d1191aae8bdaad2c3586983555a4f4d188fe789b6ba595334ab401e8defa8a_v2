He is known for wearing the distinctive helm of Sandor Clegane, which adds to his fearsome appearance. LEM is closely associated with key figures in the Brotherhood, including Beric Dondarrion, whom he knows to still be alive, and Tom of Sevenstreams and Anguy, with whom he was present when they discovered Arya Stark, Gendry, and Hot Pie.\n\nLEM plays a significant role in the Brotherhood’s actions, particularly in their pursuit of justice against those they deem guilty. Notably, he is involved in the execution of Merrett Frey, where he ties the noose around Merrett’s neck, ensuring his demise. This act underscores LEM’s ruthless and uncompromising nature when dealing with the enemies of the Brotherhood. His presence and actions reflect the Brotherhood’s broader mission of vengeance and retribution against those who have wronged the innocent, particularly the Freys, who are infamous for their betrayal at the Red Wedding.\n\nLEM’s character is marked by his loyalty to the Brotherhood and his willingness to carry out its harsh judgments. His involvement in key events, such as the discovery of Arya and her companions and the execution of Merrett Frey, highlights his importance within the group. Despite his outlaw status, LEM operates with a sense of purpose, aligning himself with the Brotherhood’s cause and contributing to their efforts to uphold their own brand of justice in a lawless world.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077160, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 336, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 582, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
