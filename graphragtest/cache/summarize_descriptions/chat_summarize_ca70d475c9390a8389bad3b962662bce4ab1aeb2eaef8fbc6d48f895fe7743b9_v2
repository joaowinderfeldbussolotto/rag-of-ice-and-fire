As a trusted advisor to Bran Stark, he plays a key role in the governance and defense of Winterfell. Known for his unwavering loyalty, Ser Rodrik is also the castellan of Winterfell and is expected to aid Leobald Tallhart in times of conflict.\n\nDuring the tumultuous events surrounding the attack on Winterfell, Ser Rodrik leads efforts to gather forces against Theon Greyjoy, who has seized control of the castle.
