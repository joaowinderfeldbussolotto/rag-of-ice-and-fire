Led by Rickard Karstark, the house was once a loyal supporter of Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings. However, following Rickard's execution for treason, the house's allegiance shifted dramatically.\n\nUnder the leadership of Arnolf Karstark, House Karstark became the only northern house to openly declare allegiance to Stannis Baratheon, breaking away from the traditional Stark loyalty. Arnolf Karstark played a significant role in urging Stannis to launch an attack on the Dreadfort, the seat of House Bolton, as part of Stannis's campaign to secure the North. Despite their involvement in these events, House Karstark is noted to have largely withdrawn from broader political and military conflicts, effectively going south and avoiding further participation in the ongoing struggles of the realm.\n\nThe house's actions reflect a complex and shifting loyalty, marked by both defiance and strategic withdrawal from the turbulent affairs of Westeros. Their unique position as the sole northern house to support Stannis underscores their break from tradition and their willingness to pursue their own interests in a time of war.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067820, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
