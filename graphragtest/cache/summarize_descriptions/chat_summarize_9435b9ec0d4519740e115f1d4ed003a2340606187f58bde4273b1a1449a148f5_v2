The village is known for its brothel, which is a popular destination for members of the Night's Watch, adding to its reputation as a place of respite and vice.\n\nAdditionally, Mole's Town serves as a refuge for wildlings, particularly those seeking shelter underground, highlighting its strategic importance during times of conflict. The people of Mole's Town are noted for their involvement in defending against wildling attacks, demonstrating their loyalty to the Night's Watch and the realm. Jon Snow is known to have stopped there to drink and encountered his former training syndicate, further cementing the town's connection to the Night's Watch and its operations.\n\nOverall, Mole's Town is a multifaceted location—part refuge, part strategic outpost, and part social hub—deeply intertwined with the struggles and alliances near the Wall.
