However, beneath this contemplation lies a more calculated agenda, as Cersei is actively manipulating Margaery's trial and imprisonment. Seeking to maintain her grip on power and eliminate potential threats, Cersei orchestrates the proceedings to ensure an outcome that serves her interests. Her actions underscore her ruthless and cunning nature, as she leverages the legal and political systems to her advantage while ensuring Margaery remains at a disadvantage. The dynamic between the two women highlights the cutthroat nature of their world, where alliances are fragile, and survival often depends on one's ability to outmaneuver rivals.
