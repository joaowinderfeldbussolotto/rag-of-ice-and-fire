As a prominent figure in House Stark, she played a significant role in the political and familial dynamics of the North. Catelyn was deeply involved in the events of the War of the Five Kings, driven by her loyalty to her family and her desire to protect her children. Tragically, she met her end at the Red Wedding, a brutal massacre orchestrated by House Frey and House Bolton, where she was murdered alongside her son Robb Stark and his forces.
