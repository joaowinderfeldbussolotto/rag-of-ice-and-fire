It serves as a significant location in the journey of Daenerys Targaryen, who arrives there seeking aid and passage after being led by the Bleeding Star. During her stay, Daenerys faces threats from the Warlocks and other factions, particularly within the House of the Undying, where she experiences profound visions. Qarth is also the birthplace of her three-headed dragons, adding to its mythical significance.\n\nThe city is a destination for the Selaesori Qhoran, a traveling vessel heading toward Qarth, and it attracts strangers from distant lands, including three who arrive seeking dragons. Tales of Daenerys and her dragons originate from Qarth, further cementing its role in her story.
