Known for his leadership and authority, he plays a crucial role in the organization, guiding its operations and commanding respect among its members. Mormont is depicted as a seasoned and respected leader, though his tenure is marked by both triumphs and challenges.\n\nAs Lord Commander, Mormont leads significant endeavors, including the investigation of Whitetree, demonstrating his commitment to the Watch's mission. His leadership is tested during a notable defeat at the Fist, highlighting the dangers and difficulties faced by the Night's Watch. Despite setbacks, he remains a key figure, recognized for his ability to utilize men like Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne, though his judgment in trusting certain individuals is later questioned.\n\nMormont is also connected to Jon Snow, whom he mentors and trusts, though this trust is ultimately betrayed. He is the one whose raven awakens Jon from a dream, and he delivers a message from Robb Stark to Jon at Winterfell, underscoring his role as a bridge between the Night's Watch and the broader political landscape of Westeros. His relationship with Jon is complex, marked by both guidance and eventual betrayal, which leads to his tragic demise.\n\nJeor Mormont's legacy is that of a formidable but flawed leader, whose life and death significantly impact the Night's Watch and those under his command.
