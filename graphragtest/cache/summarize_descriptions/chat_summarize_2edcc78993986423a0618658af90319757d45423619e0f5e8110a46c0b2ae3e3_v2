As a loyal member of House Stark's household guard, he was tasked with protecting Ned Stark during his time as Hand of the King in King's Landing. Tragically, WYL met his end at the hands of Lannister forces, specifically by the Kingslayer, Jaime Lannister. His death occurred amid the political turmoil and violence that erupted between House Stark and House Lannister. WYL's killing was part of a broader conflict that saw several of Ned Stark's guardsmen slain, reflecting the brutal and unforgiving nature of the power struggle in the capital.
