Tasked with traveling across the realm to seek new recruits, he plays a crucial role in bolstering the ranks of the Night’s Watch, ensuring the Wall remains manned against the threats beyond. Yoren is often seen leading groups of new recruits to join the Night’s Watch, guiding them on the perilous journey north.\n\nIn addition to his recruitment duties, Yoren is known to discuss the fate of Benjen Stark, a high-ranking member of the Night’s Watch who went missing beyond the Wall.
