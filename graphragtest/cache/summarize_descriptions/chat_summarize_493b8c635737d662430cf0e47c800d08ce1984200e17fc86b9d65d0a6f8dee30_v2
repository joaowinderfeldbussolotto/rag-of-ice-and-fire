Initially an ally of Stannis Baratheon, he plays a significant role in smuggling and naval operations, supporting Stannis' campaign for the Iron Throne. His fleet is instrumental in rescuing Davos Seaworth, demonstrating his strategic importance and loyalty to Stannis' cause.\n\nDespite his early allegiance, Salladhor Saan eventually abandons Stannis Baratheon, leaving Davos stranded on Sweetsister.

Additionally, Stannis intends to pay him off with gold from the Night's Watch, further emphasizing his mercenary tendencies and the transactional nature of their alliance.\n\nOverall, Salladhor Saan is a complex and multifaceted character, balancing his roles as a pirate, a fleet commander, and a political player in the turbulent landscape of Westeros.
