Initially, the Khalasar was prominently led by Khal Drogo, a formidable warrior, and included around 40,000 warriors, embodying the fierce and warrior-centric culture of the Dothraki. This group was known for its involvement in warfare, slavery, and nomadic travels, including journeys to Vaes Dothrak and campaigns such as the burning of Mirri Maz Duur’s temple.\n\nViserys Targaryen once sought an alliance with a Khalasar, specifically Drogo’s, to further his ambitions. After Khal Drogo’s death, the Khalasar underwent a significant transition. Daenerys Targaryen, Drogo’s widow, declared herself the leader of the Khalasar, uniting the remaining Dothraki and other followers under her command. This new iteration of the Khalasar included bloodriders and loyalists who adhered to her leadership, even as they faced hardships, such as surviving the Red Waste.\n\nThe Khalasar is not only a military force but also a nomadic community, reflecting the Dothraki way of life. It is a dynamic entity, evolving from a traditional Dothraki war band under Drogo to a group that follows Daenerys, blending Dothraki traditions with her vision. The Khalasar’s movements and actions, such as approaching Selhorys or planning to invade Westeros, highlight its role as a powerful and mobile force in the world of the Dothraki.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749060320, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 611, "total_tokens": 958, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
