Led by Lord Walder Frey, the house is known for its political maneuvering, treachery, and unreliable loyalty, as demonstrated during Robert's Rebellion and subsequent conflicts. Despite their pledges, the Freys are often opportunistic, waiting to see the outcome of wars before committing fully to any side.\n\nHouse Frey played a significant role in the War of the Five Kings, initially negotiating with Catelyn Stark to allow Robb Stark’s army to cross the Twins, with marital negotiations between Robb and a Frey daughter as part of the agreement. However, their loyalty proved fickle, as they later resisted Davos Seaworth’s plea for an alliance with Stannis Baratheon, showcasing their hesitance to commit without clear advantage. Some of their levies did follow Robb Stark, but their overall allegiance remained uncertain.\n\nThe house is also known for its aggressive and violent tendencies, as seen in conflicts such as the fight with House Manderly at Winterfell. Edwyn Frey, a prominent member, was placed in charge by Jaime Lannister, further illustrating the house’s shifting alliances. The Freys, including figures like Big Walder and Little Walder, are deeply entrenched in the political and military struggles of Westeros, often prioritizing self-interest over honor or steadfast loyalty.\n\nIn summary, House Frey is a cunning and formidable noble family, whose control over the Twins and strategic positioning in the Riverlands make them key players in the realm’s conflicts. Their reputation for treachery and opportunism defines their interactions with other great houses, ensuring their survival through calculated alliances rather than unwavering fealty.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063392, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 404, "total_tokens": 770, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
