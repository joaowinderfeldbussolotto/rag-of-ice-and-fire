As members of House Tully, they share a familial bond and a connection to the political and social dynamics of the realm. Catelyn, known for her intelligence and strong sense of duty, is Lysa’s sister and plays a significant role in the events surrounding their family and the broader conflicts in Westeros.\n\nAt one point, Catelyn attempts to reason with Lysa regarding the trial of Tyrion Lannister, a contentious and politically charged situation. This interaction highlights Catelyn’s diplomatic approach and her efforts to navigate the complex relationships and alliances that define their world. Lysa, on the other hand, is often portrayed as more emotionally volatile, which contrasts with Catelyn’s measured demeanor.\n\nTheir relationship as sisters is central to their characters, with their shared history and familial ties influencing their actions and decisions.
