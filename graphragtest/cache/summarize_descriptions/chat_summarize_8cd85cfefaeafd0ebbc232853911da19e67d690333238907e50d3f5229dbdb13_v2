Over time, Cersei grew suspicious of Senelle, believing her to be a spy working for Margaery Tyrell's cousins, likely due to the political tensions and paranoia surrounding the Lannister and Tyrell factions. Despite her role as a trusted servant, Cersei's distrust led to dire consequences for Senelle. She became a subject of Qyburn's experiments, which were known for their brutal and often fatal nature. Unfortunately, Senelle did not survive these experiments, marking a grim end to her service in the Red Keep. Her story reflects the dangerous and unpredictable environment of court life under Cersei's rule, where suspicion and betrayal often led to tragic outcomes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077864, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 369, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
