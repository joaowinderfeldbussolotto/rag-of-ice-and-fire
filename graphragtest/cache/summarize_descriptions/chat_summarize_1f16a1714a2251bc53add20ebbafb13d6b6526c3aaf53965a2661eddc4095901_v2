He is a young man known for his loyalty to Stannis Baratheon, who initially keeps him close as a servant or messenger, including delivering a summons to Davos on Stannis's behalf. Despite his youth, Devan demonstrates unwavering dedication to Stannis's cause, though his role is sometimes influenced by Melisandre, who keeps him back for her own purposes. Initially believed to be lost or dead, Devan is later revealed to be alive, much to the relief of his father, Davos. His character embodies both the dutiful service of a squire and the resilience of a survivor in the tumultuous world of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749069452, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
