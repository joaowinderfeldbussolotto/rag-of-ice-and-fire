As the Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms, Pycelle is responsible for advising the king and the small council on matters of health, science, and governance. In his capacity, he conveys the critical news of King Robert Baratheon’s death to Ned Stark, a moment that marks a pivotal turning point in the political landscape of Westeros.
