Despite his long-standing service, Cressen often finds himself at odds with Stannis, as he opposes some of his decisions while still striving to guide him. Over time, Stannis grows increasingly dismissive of Cressen’s advice, ultimately rejecting his counsel despite the maester’s unwavering loyalty. Cressen’s role is marked by a deep sense of duty, even as his relationship with Stannis becomes strained. His reflections on Stannis’s grievances and his attempts to advise him highlight the tension between loyalty and disagreement in their dynamic.
