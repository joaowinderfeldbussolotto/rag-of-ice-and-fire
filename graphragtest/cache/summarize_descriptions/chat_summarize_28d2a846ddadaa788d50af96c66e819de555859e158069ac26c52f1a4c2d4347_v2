During Robert's Rebellion, he fought on the side of House Targaryen, demonstrating his loyalty to the ruling dynasty at the time. His allegiance, however, came at a great cost, as his village was destroyed by Hoster Tully, likely as a consequence of his support for the Targaryens. Despite this setback, Lord Goodbrook later managed to secure a royal pardon, which allowed him to re-enter noble service. This pardon was granted when he pledged his loyalty to King Tommen Baratheon, marking a shift in his political alliances. His story reflects the turbulent and often brutal nature of Westerosi politics, where loyalties can change with the shifting tides of power. Lord Goodbrook's resilience and adaptability highlight his ability to navigate the complex landscape of noble service, even after facing significant adversity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077451, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
