Septon Raynard serves as a representative of the Faith, standing before Cersei Lannister in his official capacity. Their interactions highlight the tension between the monarchy and the religious institution, with Cersei’s irritation underscoring her disdain for the Faith’s influence. Septon Raynard, as a figure of the Faith, embodies the authority and moral stance of the religious order, which often clashes with Cersei’s political ambitions and personal grievances. Their dynamic reflects the broader conflict between the crown and the Faith of the Seven, a recurring theme in their relationship.
