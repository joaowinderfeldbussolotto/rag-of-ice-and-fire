He was initially sent away by Grand Maester Pycelle for treating Lord Jon Arryn, though he later returned to serve Lysa Arryn at the Eyrie. In this role, Colemon became a trusted figure, providing medical care and counsel to the household. Notably, he was called upon to treat Lord Robert Arryn, the young and ailing heir to the Vale, particularly after the boy suffered a seizure. His expertise in healing and his involvement in the care of key members of House Arryn underscore his importance within the region.
