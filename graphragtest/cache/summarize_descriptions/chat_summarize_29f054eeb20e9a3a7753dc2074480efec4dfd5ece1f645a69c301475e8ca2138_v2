A Qohorik sellsword, Hoat is infamous for his ruthless tactics and cruelty, particularly his role in maiming Jaime Lannister by amputating his hand. He is a key figure in the turbulent history of Harrenhal, a fortress he eventually hands over to Roose Bolton, who rewards him with its control.\n\nHoat is a commander of significant influence, leading a force of 300 men tasked with setting fire to the riverlands, further cementing his reputation as a destructive and merciless leader. He is also responsible for the death of Ser Amory Lorch, whom he kills using a bear, showcasing his brutal methods. Additionally, Hoat holds Brienne of Tarth captive and interacts with Jaime Lannister, refusing to release them for ransom despite their noble status.\n\nRumors surround Hoat, including claims that he killed Beric Dondarrion, though his most confirmed atrocities involve his treatment of Jaime and his role in the violent affairs of Harrenhal. His name is invoked as a threat, particularly by figures like Weese, who use his reputation to intimidate others, such as Arya Stark. Despite his eventual demise, Vargo Hoat remains a symbol of the brutality and chaos that plagued the riverlands and Harrenhal during his time. His actions and leadership leave a lasting mark on the region's history, intertwined with the darker chapters of the War of the Five Kings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067676, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 425, "total_tokens": 768, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
