Unlike some of his family members, Allard disagrees with the burning of the Seven gods, viewing it as a wrongful act. Despite his reservations about this aspect of Stannis' campaign, he remains a devoted supporter and is sent across the Narrow Sea to deliver a declaration to the Free Cities on behalf of his lord. Allard harbors aspirations of knighthood, reflecting his desire for honor and recognition beyond his current station. His character is marked by a blend of loyalty to his father and Stannis, as well as a personal moral compass that sets him apart from those who blindly follow the more extreme measures of their cause.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749069380, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 369, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
