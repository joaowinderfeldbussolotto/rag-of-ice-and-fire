Wyman Manderly, a powerful lord, has pledged his loyalty to King Tommen, reinforcing the king's authority in the North. Additionally, Ser Ronnet, a notable knight, remains steadfast in his loyalty to the young monarch. The Lionstar, a significant vessel, proudly displays King Tommen's standard, symbolizing his reign and influence over the royal fleet.\n\nDespite his position, King Tommen faces threats, particularly from the Sand Snakes, a vengeful group seeking retribution against the ruling Baratheon-Lannister regime. His rule is marked by both loyalty from key supporters and opposition from those who challenge his legitimacy or seek vengeance for past grievances.
