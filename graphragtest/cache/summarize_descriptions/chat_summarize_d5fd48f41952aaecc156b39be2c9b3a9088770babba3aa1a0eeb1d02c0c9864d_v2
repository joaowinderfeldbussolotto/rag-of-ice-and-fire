She is identified as a wet nurse who served the noble House Dayne for many years. According to some accounts, Wylla is also the woman with whom Ned Stark, the former Warden of the North, fathered Jon Snow. This connection suggests that she played a significant role in Jon’s early life, though the details of her relationship with Ned Stark remain shrouded in mystery. While her primary role is often cited as a wet nurse, the claim of her being Jon Snow’s mother adds a layer of complexity to her character, tying her directly to one of the most debated lineage questions in Westeros. Despite the varying accounts, Wylla’s association with both the Daynes and the Starks underscores her importance in the broader narrative.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749061484, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
