He was taken prisoner during the Battle of Oxcross, a significant conflict where forces loyal to House Lannister clashed with those of the North, led by Robb Stark. Following his capture, Martyn became a captive of Robb Stark, who later proposed him as part of a prisoner exchange. His status as a captive made him a potential bargaining chip in the broader political and military negotiations between the warring factions.
