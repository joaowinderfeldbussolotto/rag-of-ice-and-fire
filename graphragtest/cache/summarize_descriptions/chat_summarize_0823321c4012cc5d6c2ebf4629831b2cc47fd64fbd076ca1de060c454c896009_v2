Originally forged from the reworked metal of Ice, the ancestral greatsword of House Stark, Oathkeeper was given to Brienne by Jaime Lannister as a token of trust and respect. The sword holds significant symbolic value, representing Brienne’s oath to protect the innocent and uphold justice.\n\nOathkeeper plays a crucial role in Brienne’s journey, serving as her primary weapon in several key encounters. Notably, she wields it to defeat the outlaws Pyg and Timeon, demonstrating her skill and commitment to her mission. However, the sword also becomes a point of contention when it is presented to Lady Stoneheart (the resurrected Catelyn Stark) as evidence against Brienne, further complicating her path.\n\nThroughout its appearances, Oathkeeper remains intrinsically linked to Brienne’s character, embodying her honor, loyalty, and unwavering dedication to her vows. Its Valyrian steel composition and storied origins make it one of the most notable weapons in the series, reinforcing Brienne’s status as a formidable warrior and a figure of moral integrity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077684, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 469, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
