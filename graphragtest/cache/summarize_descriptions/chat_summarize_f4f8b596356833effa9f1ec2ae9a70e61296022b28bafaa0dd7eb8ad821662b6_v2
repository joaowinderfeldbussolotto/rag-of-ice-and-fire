Known for its influential members, the house has played a significant role in the political and military landscape of the realm. Among its most notable figures are Robert, Stannis, and Renly Baratheon, who have each left a lasting impact on the history of Westeros. The house is also associated with Steffon Baratheon, the father of Robert, Stannis, and Renly, further solidifying its lineage.\n\nHouse Baratheon has historical ties to other major noble families, including the Lannisters, through strategic marriages that have shaped alliances and power dynamics in the region. Additionally, the house is linked to Joffrey and Tommen Baratheon, though their lineage is a subject of controversy and debate. Despite this, the Baratheons remain one of the most recognizable and powerful families in Westeros, with a legacy marked by both triumph and turmoil.\n\nThe house's sigil, a crowned stag, symbolizes its strength and authority, reflecting its standing as a major noble house.
