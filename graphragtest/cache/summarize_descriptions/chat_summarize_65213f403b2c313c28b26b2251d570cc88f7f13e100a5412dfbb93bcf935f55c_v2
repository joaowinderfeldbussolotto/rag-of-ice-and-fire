The family holds significant influence in the region, with a history marked by both alliances and internal conflicts. Key members of the house include Catelyn, Edmure, and Lord Hoster Tully, who have played pivotal roles in the political and military affairs of Westeros.\n\nThe Tullys are known for their leadership in the Riverlands, particularly during times of conflict. They have been strong allies of House Stark, notably supporting Robb Stark in his campaign against the Lannisters. This alliance was further solidified through familial ties, as Catelyn Stark (n√©e Tully) was the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully and the sister of Edmure Tully.\n\nDespite their united front in external conflicts, House Tully has experienced internal strife, most notably the long-standing feud between Lord Hoster Tully and his brother, Ser Brynden Tully, also known as the Blackfish. This feud underscored tensions within the family but did not diminish their collective influence or their commitment to the Riverlands.\n\nAs rulers of Riverrun, the Tullys have maintained a strong presence in the region, commanding loyalty and respect from their bannermen. Their strategic location and leadership have made them a crucial power in the political landscape of Westeros, particularly during the War of the Five Kings. Through both diplomacy and military prowess, House Tully has cemented its legacy as a formidable and enduring noble house.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749064220, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 308, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 543, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
