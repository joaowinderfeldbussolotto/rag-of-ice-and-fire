Recognizing her potential to reclaim the Iron Throne and reshape Westeros, Tyrion offers his strategic mind and experience to aid her cause. However, his decision is not without hesitation. He contemplates revealing his true identity to Daenerys but harbors concerns about the reaction of Ser Barristan Selmy, a loyal and honorable knight in her service. Tyrion fears that Selmyâ€™s deep-seated prejudice against the Lannisters, stemming from their role in the downfall of House Targaryen, may jeopardize his position or even his life.
