Jon, known for his leadership and combat skills, befriends and protects Sam, who is more intellectually inclined and initially struggles with the physical demands of the Watch. Their bond strengthens as they share their duties, fears, and personal struggles while serving together.\n\nAt Castle Black, the headquarters of the Night's Watch, Sam and Jon often engage in deep discussions about their responsibilities, the looming dangers beyond the Wall, and their own uncertainties.

During their reunions, they discuss various matters, including the political tensions within the Watch, the rising threat of the White Walkers, and their personal aspirations.
