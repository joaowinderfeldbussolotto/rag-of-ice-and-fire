He was the last King in the North to hold the title of King of Winter before the arrival of Aegon the Conqueror. Torrhen Stark is notably referenced by Renly Baratheon as an example of a ruler who chose to yield to a conqueror rather than face certain destruction. His decision to submit to Aegon Targaryen marked the end of the independent Kingdom of the North and the beginning of its allegiance to the Iron Throne. This act of surrender, though seen by some as a moment of weakness, is often regarded as a pragmatic choice that spared his people from the devastation of war. Torrhen Stark is also mentioned by Bran Stark, highlighting his place among the notable Kings of Winter in the history of House Stark. His legacy is one of wisdom and foresight, as his submission ensured the survival of his house and people under the new Targaryen rule.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067472, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
