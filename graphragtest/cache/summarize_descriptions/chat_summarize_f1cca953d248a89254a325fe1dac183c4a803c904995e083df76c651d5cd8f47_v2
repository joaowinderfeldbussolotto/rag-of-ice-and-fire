They are known for their aggressive stance against Daenerys Targaryen, particularly targeting her dragons. The group has taken hostages and is demanding the destruction of Daenerys' dragons as a condition for their release. Their primary objective appears to be the elimination of the dragons, which they view as a significant threat. The Yunkai'i's actions reflect their determination to undermine Daenerys' power and influence in the region, making them a formidable adversary in the ongoing political and military struggles in Meereen.
