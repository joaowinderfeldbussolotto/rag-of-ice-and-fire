Additionally, he is tasked with escorting Arya Stark to her room in the Red Keep, indicating his involvement in the family’s affairs even beyond Winterfell.\n\nDespite his service to the Starks, Desmond’s fate takes a dark turn when he is killed by Lannister forces, likely during the conflict that arises after Lord Eddard’s arrest.
