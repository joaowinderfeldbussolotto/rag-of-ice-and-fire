In the context of Daenerys Targaryen, they function as her dedicated protectors, warning her against trusting figures like Quaithe and safeguarding her during her time among the Dothraki. Originally, the Khas were Dothraki warriors who pledged to protect Daenerys and her unborn child, demonstrating their loyalty to her as their khaleesi.\n\nAfter the death of Khal Drogo, the Khas, like much of the Dothraki, were weakened, reflecting the broader decline of the khalasar following his fall. Despite this, they remained a significant faction, particularly associated with figures like Ko Jhaqo, who played a role in the power struggles among the Dothraki. Their primary role as elite guards underscores their importance in Dothraki society, where they serve as both warriors and trusted attendants to their leader.\n\nIn summary, the Khas are a loyal and formidable subgroup within the Dothraki, known for their service to Daenerys Targaryen, their protective duties, and their diminished but still notable presence after Drogoâ€™s death.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067040, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 264, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
