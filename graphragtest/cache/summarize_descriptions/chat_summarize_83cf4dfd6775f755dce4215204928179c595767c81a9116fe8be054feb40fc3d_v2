Led by Roose Bolton and his infamous son Ramsay Snow (later legitimized as Ramsay Bolton), the house holds significant power and authority, though their rule is grudgingly accepted by many northmen, with notable opposition from figures like Lady Barbrey Dustin.\n\nHouse Bolton played a pivotal role in the conflicts of the North, including the struggles in the Hornwood forest. Initially allied with Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings, their loyalty proved treacherous when Roose Bolton betrayed and murdered Robb Stark at the Red Wedding, shifting their allegiance to the Lannisters. This act solidified their reputation for cunning and brutality.\n\nUnder Ramsay Bolton’s leadership, the house became even more feared, as he was known for his sadistic tendencies and brutal tactics. The Boltons fiercely opposed Stannis Baratheon’s campaign in the North, ultimately defeating him at the Battle of Ice. Despite their power, House Bolton’s rule was marked by fear and resentment, culminating in their downfall when Jon Snow and Sansa Stark reclaimed Winterfell, ending their reign. Their legacy remains one of infamy, defined by their ruthless pursuit of power and dominance in the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066812, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 530, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
