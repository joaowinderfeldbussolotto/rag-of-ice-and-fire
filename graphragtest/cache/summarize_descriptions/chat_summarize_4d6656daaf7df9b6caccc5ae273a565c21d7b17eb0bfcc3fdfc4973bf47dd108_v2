As the head of his house, he governs the Riverlands with a firm hand, earning both respect and wariness from his peers. Known for his distrust of Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, Hoster maintains a cautious and often strained relationship with House Frey, reflecting his shrewd and discerning nature.\n\nHoster Tully is also notable for his role in the upbringing of Petyr Baelish, commonly known as Littlefinger. Recognizing the young man's ambitions and potential, Hoster took him in as a ward, though he later sent Littlefinger away, possibly due to his growing attachment to Catelyn or other political considerations. This decision underscores Hoster's protective instincts toward his family and his keen awareness of the complexities of noble alliances and rivalries.\n\nThroughout his life, Hoster Tully has been a steadfast and influential figure, shaping the fortunes of House Tully and its allies. His leadership and decisions have had lasting impacts on the realm, particularly in the dynamics between the great houses of Westeros. His legacy is marked by both his strategic acumen and his deep commitment to his family's honor and security.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066416, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 270, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 451, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
