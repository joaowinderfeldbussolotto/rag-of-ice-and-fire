As the son of Martyn Cassel, his death marked the tragic end of his family line. Jory was known for his unwavering dedication to House Stark, serving as one of Ned’s most trusted protectors. He played a notable role in Arya Stark’s life, helping her drive away her direwolf, Nymeria, and keeping the secret of the wolf’s fate to protect Arya from repercussions.\n\nBeyond his duties as a guardsman, Jory was also involved in more covert operations, including searching whorehouses for information, demonstrating his resourcefulness and commitment to his lord’s causes. His life came to a violent end when he was killed while defending Ned Stark, a testament to his loyalty and bravery. Jory’s death was a significant loss to House Stark, as he was not only a skilled warrior but also a symbol of the honor and devotion that defined the Stark household. His legacy endures as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who served the Starks during tumultuous times.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075157, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
