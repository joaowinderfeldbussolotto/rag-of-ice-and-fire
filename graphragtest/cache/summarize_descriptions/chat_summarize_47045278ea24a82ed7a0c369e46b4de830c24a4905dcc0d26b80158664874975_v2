Known for his unsettling presence, he is believed to bring divine assistance, which both intrigues and disturbs Victarion's crew. Despite their unease, Moqorro's abilities are undeniable, as demonstrated when he heals Victarion's wound, reinforcing his reputation as a man of significant spiritual power. His prophetic visions, often seen in the flames, guide his actions and lend him an air of mysticism. During his time aboard the *Selaesori Qhoran*, these visions play a crucial role in shaping events, further solidifying his role as a figure of both reverence and fear. Moqorro's origins and his deep connection to the faith of R'hllor make him a compelling and enigmatic presence in the narrative.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749078716, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
