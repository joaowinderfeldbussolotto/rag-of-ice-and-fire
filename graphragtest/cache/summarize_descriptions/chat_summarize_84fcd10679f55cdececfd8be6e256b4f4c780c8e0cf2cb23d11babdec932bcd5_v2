A cunning and politically astute nobleman, he is known for his intricate maneuvering and strategic alliances, often waiting until the outcome of conflicts is clear before committing his forces. As a father to numerous children, including Stevron Frey and Elmar Frey, and grandfather to the Walders, he has used his family as tools in his political schemes, including offering his daughters as potential brides to secure alliances, such as with Ser Brynden.\n\nWalder Frey’s reputation is marred by distrust due to his past disloyalty, most notably his broken alliance with Robb Stark. This betrayal stemmed from Robb’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which nullified a prior agreement to wed one of Frey’s daughters. His late arrival at the Battle of the Trident further cemented his reputation for opportunism. Despite this, he remained a key player in the political landscape, negotiating with both Robb Stark and Catelyn Stark for the passage of Robb’s army across the Green Fork, amassing 4,000 men in the process.\n\nFrey’s most infamous act was orchestrating the Red Wedding, a massacre that resulted in the deaths of Robb Stark and many of his bannermen, solidifying his role in the downfall of House Stark. His involvement in political intrigue extended to the death of a king, further demonstrating his ruthless ambition. Additionally, he was considered a potential recipient of Harrenhal, highlighting his influence and the rewards he sought for his actions.\n\nAs the Lord of the Twins, Walder Frey’s legacy is one of calculated betrayal and political pragmatism, making him one of the most feared and distrusted figures in the realm. His actions, particularly the Red Wedding, have left an indelible mark on the history of the Seven Kingdoms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075281, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 396, "prompt_tokens": 472, "total_tokens": 868, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
