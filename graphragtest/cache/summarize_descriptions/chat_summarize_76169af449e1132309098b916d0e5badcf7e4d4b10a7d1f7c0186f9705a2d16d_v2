The house is prominently associated with key figures such as Catelyn Stark (née Tully), her sister Lysa Arryn, and their brother Edmure Tully. The Tullys have strong political and marital ties to other major houses, particularly House Stark, through Catelyn’s marriage to Ned Stark, and House Arryn, through Lysa’s marriage to Jon Arryn. Additionally, House Frey, led by Lord Walder Frey, is among their bannermen, having sworn allegiance to the Tullys.\n\nThe Tullys play a significant role in the political and military landscape of Westeros. Their forces have faced challenges, including defeats at the hands of Jaime Lannister during the War of the Five Kings. Despite these setbacks, House Tully remains a central power in the Riverlands, with their bannermen often seeking their support, as seen when they petitioned Ned Stark regarding raids on their lands.\n\nRiverrun, the stronghold of House Tully, serves as both a military and political hub, with the family’s banners flying prominently over its walls. The house’s influence extends beyond their immediate region, as they are deeply involved in broader conflicts and alliances, including their alliance with House Stark. The Tullys are known for their resilience and strategic importance, making them a key player in the struggles for power in Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749059948, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 480, "total_tokens": 775, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
