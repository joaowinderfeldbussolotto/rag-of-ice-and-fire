Known for her cryptic and ominous presence, she is said to refer to others as \"slavers,\" hinting at a deep disdain for those who exploit or control others. Her connection to the supernatural is further emphasized by her association with \"dead things,\" suggesting a possible link to necromancy or the darker aspects of the natural world.\n\nThe Woods Witch is also infamous for delivering a chilling prophecy to Cersei Lannister, foretelling her eventual downfall. This prophecy, shrouded in ambiguity and dread, underscores her role as a seer or oracle, capable of glimpsing the fates of others. Her interactions with Cersei highlight her influence and the fear she instills, as her words carry the weight of inevitability.\n\nDespite her elusive nature, the Woods Witch remains a significant and haunting figure, embodying the wild, untamed magic of the forests and the unsettling power of prophecy.
