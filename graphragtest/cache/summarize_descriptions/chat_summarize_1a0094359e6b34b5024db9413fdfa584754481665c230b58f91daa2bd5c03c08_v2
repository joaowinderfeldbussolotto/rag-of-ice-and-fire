Eddard Stark, a prominent figure known for his sense of justice, sought to punish Ser Jorah for his crimes, which led to his exile. This action left a lasting impact on Ser Jorah, who harbors deep resentment toward Eddard Stark for the exile, viewing it as a harsh and unjust punishment. The relationship between the two is defined by this past confrontation, with Eddard Stark acting as the enforcer of justice and Ser Jorah as the embittered exile.
