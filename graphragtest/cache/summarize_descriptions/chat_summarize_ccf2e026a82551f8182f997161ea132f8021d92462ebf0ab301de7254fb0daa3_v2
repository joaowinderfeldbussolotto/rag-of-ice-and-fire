Their role evolved to support her ambitions, including her quest to reclaim the Iron Throne and liberate enslaved populations. The Bloodriders are distinguished by their martial skills, fierce dedication, and the deep bond they share with Daenerys, often accompanying her into the most dangerous situations.
