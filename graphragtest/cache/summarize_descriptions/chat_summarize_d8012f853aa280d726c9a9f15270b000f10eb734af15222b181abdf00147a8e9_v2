His birth played a significant role in shaping the family dynamics, as it led to his older brother, Samwell Tarly, being disinherited and sent away due to Randyll's dissatisfaction with Sam's perceived weaknesses. Dickon is noted for revealing a wager involving Brienne of Tarth, though the specifics of this bet are not fully detailed. As the second son, Dickon likely faced the pressures and expectations typical of noble-born children in a martial family like the Tarlys, known for their military prowess and strict adherence to duty.
