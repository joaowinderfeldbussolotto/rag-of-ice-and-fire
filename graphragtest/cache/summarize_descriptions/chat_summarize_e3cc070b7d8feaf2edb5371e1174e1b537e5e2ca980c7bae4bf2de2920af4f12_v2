It serves as a key river crossing point near the Twins, the only viable passage for Robb Stark’s army as they march toward Riverrun. The river’s strategic importance is highlighted by its use as a crossing for Robb’s cavalry, facilitating their movement during the war.\n\nGreen Fork is also the site of a major battle where the Lannister forces, led by Tyrion Lannister, engage the Stark army. This confrontation results in significant casualties, including the death of Lady Donella Hornwood’s husband and son, marking it as a tragic and pivotal moment in the conflict. The battle at Green Fork underscores the river’s role as both a geographical landmark and a battleground in the struggle for control over the Riverlands.\n\nIn summary, Green Fork is a river of strategic military importance, serving as a crossing point for Robb Stark’s forces and the location of a decisive battle between the Starks and Lannisters, with notable losses, including members of House Hornwood.
