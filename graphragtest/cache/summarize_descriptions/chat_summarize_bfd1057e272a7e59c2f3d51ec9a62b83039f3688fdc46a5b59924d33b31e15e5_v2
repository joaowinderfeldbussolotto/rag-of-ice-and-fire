Mychel, despite being deeply loved by Mya, faces societal and familial barriers that prevent him from marrying her, primarily because of her status as a bastard. Their relationship is marked by genuine affection and devotion, but external pressures and societal expectations create significant obstacles. The disparity in their social standing casts a shadow over their future together, as Mychel’s position likely demands adherence to conventions that forbid a union with someone of Mya’s lineage.
