Known for their fierce and independent nature, the Wildlings are often involved in conflicts, both among themselves and with those south of the Wall. They are feared by many, including figures like Samwell Tarly, who notes their proximity to the Wall as unusual, and Sansa Stark and Joffrey Baratheon, who find them particularly intimidating.\n\nThe Wildlings are also depicted as a people in need of aid, as seen when a group becomes trapped at Hardhome, prompting Jon Snow to plan a rescue mission.
