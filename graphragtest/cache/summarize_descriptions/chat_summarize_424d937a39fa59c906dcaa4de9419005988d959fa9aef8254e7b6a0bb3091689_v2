He is the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a guerrilla faction that opposes the Lannister forces and fights for justice. Beric is renowned for his resilience, having been reported killed multiple times, including by Amory Lorch and the Bloody Mummers, yet he continues to reappear, earning him the eerie moniker \"Lord of Corpses.\"\n\nOriginally serving under the king's banner, Beric was sent by Ned Stark to dispense the king's justice against Gregor Clegane, marking his shift from a traditional knight to a rebel leader. He leads raids and ambushes against Lord Tywin Lannister's forces, particularly targeting their foraging parties and supply lines. His band is accused of raiding Saltpans, and he is sought by both Gregor Clegane and the Lannisters, who see him as a persistent threat.\n\nBeric is also a figure of intrigue and mystery. He is rumored to be associated with Yoren's group and is sought by the Brotherhood Without Banners themselves, adding to the legends surrounding his survival. Despite his outlaw status, he maintains a sense of justice, as seen when he judges Sandor Clegane, who later joins his band. His leadership and actions make him a key figure in the resistance against the Lannisters, and he is both feared and respected by his enemies.\n\nAdditionally, Beric is a figure of interest to various characters. Jeyne expresses willingness to marry him immediately, while Jaime Lannister requests his capture. Merrett Frey demands to see him before his execution, though Beric is notably absent during that event, as he is \"needed elsewhere.\" His whereabouts are often uncertain, and his movements are closely watched by both allies and foes.\n\nIn summary, Beric Dondarrion is a complex and enduring figure—a knight turned outlaw leader, a symbol of resistance, and a man whose death is repeatedly defied, making him one of the most intriguing characters in the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075272, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 443, "prompt_tokens": 599, "total_tokens": 1042, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
