Polliver had previously taken Arya’s sword, Needle, an act that deeply angered her. During their encounter, Arya manages to reclaim Needle, her prized possession, from Polliver. The tension between them escalates into a fight, driven by Arya’s resentment over the theft of her sword and her determination to recover it. The conflict underscores Arya’s growing resolve and skill in combat, as well as her unwavering attachment to Needle, a symbol of her identity and heritage.
