The castle is known for its resilience, with Lord Tywin Lannister expecting it to resist submission, underscoring its formidable defenses and the determination of its defenders.\n\nBeyond its role in the feud between the Blackwoods and Brackens, Raventree Hall is also associated with the mysterious disappearance of Jaime Lannister.
