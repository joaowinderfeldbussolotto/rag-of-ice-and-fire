As the deceased brother of Daenerys Targaryen, he serves as a point of comparison to her leadership, highlighting the legacy and expectations tied to the Targaryen name. Rhaegar is frequently mentioned in discussions about the past, particularly in the context of Robert’s Rebellion, where his role and fate were pivotal. Additionally, he is noted in Tyrion Lannister’s jest, underscoring his enduring presence in the collective memory of the story’s characters. A lesser-known but intriguing detail is the suggestion that Rhaegar may have been Tyrion’s real father, adding a layer of complexity to his character and the broader political and familial dynamics of the narrative.
