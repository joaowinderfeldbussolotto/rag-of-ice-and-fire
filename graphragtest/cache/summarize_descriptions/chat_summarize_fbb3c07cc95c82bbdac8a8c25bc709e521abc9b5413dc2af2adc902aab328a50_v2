As a lord, he held lands that Cersei Lannister sought to claim for the Crown following his death. During his lifetime, Gyles Rosby was an active participant in courtly affairs, attending significant events such as the tourney and being present during the mistreatment of Sansa Stark, though his role in such matters remains unspecified.\n\nHe was also among the nobles who received a copy of Stannis Baratheon’s proclamation, indicating his involvement in the political intrigues of the time. Despite his apparent infirmity, he was appointed as Master of Coin by Cersei Lannister, a position of considerable responsibility, though his effectiveness in the role may have been limited by his health. Additionally, Lord Gyles Rosby was known for his courtly demeanor, having proposed a toast to the king on at least one occasion, further cementing his presence in the royal court.\n\nHis life and career reflect the complexities of noble service—balancing loyalty, political maneuvering, and the inevitable decline that comes with age.
