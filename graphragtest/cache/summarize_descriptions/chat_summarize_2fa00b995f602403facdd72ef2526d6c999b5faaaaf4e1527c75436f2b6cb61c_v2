As the daughter of Ned Stark and Catelyn Stark, she is the eldest Stark daughter and sister to Bran and Arya. Initially, she is an eleven-year-old noblewoman from the North, betrothed to Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon as part of a political alliance. However, her life takes a dramatic turn when her father, Eddard Stark, is executed for treason, leaving her a captive of the Lannisters in King’s Landing, where she is held as a hostage and political pawn.\n\nDuring her time in the capital, Sansa is fitted for gowns by Queen Cersei and interacts with Joffrey, revealing her desires and fears. She is also present in the throne room and court, where her status as a hostage is evident. Her direwolf, Lady, is lost, and she is later betrothed to Tyrion Lannister, though this marriage is never consummated. Her loyalty is tested when she betrays her father’s plans out of love for Joffrey, a decision that haunts her.\n\nSansa’s disappearance is later mentioned in relation to a girl found with Lord Tywin, and she becomes a subject of concern for figures like Brienne of Tarth, who claims to have found her. Jaime Lannister also seeks to protect her at one point. After escaping King’s Landing, she is eventually married to Ramsay Bolton, though this is not mentioned in the provided descriptions. Throughout her journey, she is referenced in Hoster Tully’s disjointed speech and remains a symbol of the Stark family’s resilience.\n\nSansa’s story is marked by captivity, political maneuvering, and personal growth, as she evolves from a naive girl into a resilient noblewoman navigating the treacherous world of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749060548, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 387, "prompt_tokens": 617, "total_tokens": 1004, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
