Grey Wind is the direwolf companion of Robb Stark, Bran’s older brother, and is deeply intertwined with the Stark family. Bran often mentions Grey Wind in the context of fighting alongside Robb, highlighting the direwolf’s role in battles and its loyalty to the Stark cause. This connection underscores the bond between the Stark siblings and their direwolves, which are seen as extensions of their family.\n\nGrey Wind is also noted to accompany Bran on his rides, suggesting a close relationship between the two. While Grey Wind is primarily Robb’s direwolf, his presence with Bran further emphasizes the unity and shared experiences of the Stark children and their direwolves. The direwolves, including Grey Wind, symbolize protection, strength, and the deep familial bonds that define House Stark.\n\nTogether, Bran and Grey Wind represent the resilience and unity of the Stark family, with Grey Wind serving as both a guardian and a companion to the Stark siblings.
