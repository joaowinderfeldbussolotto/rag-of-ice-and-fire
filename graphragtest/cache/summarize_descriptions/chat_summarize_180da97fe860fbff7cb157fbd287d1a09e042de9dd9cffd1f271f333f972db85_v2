They are a fiercely independent people, organized into khalasars—mobile war bands—led by powerful leaders known as khals. Among their notable leaders is Khal Drogo, who is seen as a formidable threat to neighboring realms. The Dothraki follow strict leadership traditions, with khals commanding absolute loyalty from their followers, including elite warriors known as bloodriders.\n\nTheir culture is deeply rooted in warfare and tradition, with rituals such as the stallion heart ceremony, where a young warrior must consume the raw heart of a stallion to prove their strength. The Dothraki are also known for their dietary preferences, particularly their consumption of horse meat. They engage in slavery and warfare as part of their way of life, often expanding their influence through conquest.\n\nThe Dothraki have significant interactions with key figures in the broader political landscape. Viserys Targaryen once sought an alliance with them, while Daenerys Targaryen became closely associated with the Dothraki after marrying Khal Drogo. They gifted her with treasures and followed her leadership, though their alliance with her has since waned, leaving them absent from Meereen. Despite this, a khalasar is reported to be approaching Selhorys, indicating their continued movement and influence.\n\nTheir society is guided by omens and traditions, such as following the red comet, which they interpret as a sign of destiny. The Dothraki remain a formidable and enigmatic force, shaping the fate of the lands they traverse through their strength, rituals, and unyielding warrior ethos.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749074215, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 362, "prompt_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
