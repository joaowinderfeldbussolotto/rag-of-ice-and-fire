Known for his strength and relatively calm demeanor, Summer is described as less aggressive than Shaggydog, another direwolf from the same litter. He accompanies Bran and, at times, Robb Stark on their journeys, serving as a loyal and protective companion. Summer is distinguished by his striking silver-and-smoke fur and piercing yellow-gold eyes, traits that set him apart as a member of the rare and noble direwolf species. As a key figure among the Stark family's direwolves, Summer plays a significant role in the lives of the Stark children, embodying both the wild nature of his kind and the deep bond shared with his human counterparts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749062744, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
