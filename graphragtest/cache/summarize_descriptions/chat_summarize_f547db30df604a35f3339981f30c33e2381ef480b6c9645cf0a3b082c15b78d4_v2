Winterfell holds significant emotional and familial importance for her, serving as the place where she spent her childhood and experienced happier times. She often recalls memories of her home while navigating other places, such as King's Landing, and compares unfamiliar locations like the Red Keep to Winterfell, her father's home. Her attachment to Winterfell is evident in her dreams and aspirations, as she longs to return there, even imagining swimming back to it.\n\nAryaâ€™s connection to Winterfell is further reinforced by her father, who sent her there for safety, underscoring its role as a refuge for her family. She also remembers praying in Winterfell, highlighting its spiritual significance in her life. Even when away from Winterfell, she encounters reminders of it, such as seeing guards from Winterfell at the wharfs, which deepens her sense of belonging to the place.
