Gifted to Daenerys to teach her the Dothraki language, Jhiqui is one of her trusted attendants, assisting her in various capacities. She is known for carrying one of Daenerys' dragons in a cage, demonstrating her close and loyal service. Additionally, Jhiqui attends to Daenerys during her illness, further highlighting her dedication as a caretaker.\n\nDespite her loyalty to Daenerys, Jhiqui also exhibits caution and fear, particularly when translating Viserys Targaryen's words, as she is wary of the potential consequences from Khal Drogo. This reflects the complex dynamics of her position, where she must navigate the expectations of both her mistress and the powerful figures around her. Jhiquiâ€™s role encompasses not only practical duties but also the delicate task of communication in a politically charged environment.
