Knighted by Stannis after delivering crucial supplies during the Siege of Storm's End, Davos becomes one of Stannis's most trusted advisors, eventually rising to the position of Hand of the King. Despite his humble origins and illiteracy, he is highly resourceful and valued for his practical advice and humility.\n\nDavos's journey is marked by both hardship and devotion. He loses several of his sons in the Battle of the Blackwater, a tragedy that deepens his resolve to serve Stannis. At one point, he is captured by Godric Borrell's men and later released, only to be imprisoned beneath Dragonstone, where he interacts with Melisandre, the enigmatic Red Priestess. His distrust of her grows, especially after recognizing a man associated with shadow magic, and he later plans to kill her in retaliation for his losses.\n\nHis missions often take him to dangerous places. He arrives in White Harbor aboard the *Merry Midwife*, seeking an alliance with Lord Wyman Manderly for Stannis. During his time there, he is held captive and later imprisoned in the Wolf's Den, awaiting execution. Despite these setbacks, he manages to learn about the events in the North and his son Devan, further fueling his determination.\n\nDavos is also instrumental in arranging the escape of Edric Storm, a young man of royal blood, and confronts Stannis over his reliance on Melisandre's dark magic. His faith is pragmatic; he once declares that the Seven have never brought him a sparrow, hinting at his skepticism toward religion. Throughout his trials, Davos remains a steadfast supporter of Stannis, balancing his loyalty with a deep sense of justice and personal loss. His character embodies resilience, wisdom, and an unyielding commitment to his king, even in the face of adversity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749068192, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 415, "prompt_tokens": 573, "total_tokens": 988, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
