He is the younger brother of Catelyn Stark and the uncle of Robb Stark, making him a significant figure in the political and military conflicts of Westeros. Edmure played a crucial role in the War of the Five Kings, initially tasked with holding Riverrun and defending it against Lannister forces. His actions, including engaging the Lannisters at the fords, disrupted Robb Stark’s strategic plans, drawing criticism from his allies.\n\nEdmure’s leadership extended to dispersing men to guard border holdfasts, demonstrating his commitment to protecting his lands. However, his wedding to Roslin Frey became the infamous site of the Red Wedding, a brutal betrayal orchestrated by the Freys and Boltons, where many of his allies were slaughtered. Following this event, Edmure was captured by the Freys and later imprisoned by Emmon Frey, accused of betrayal. He was also held by the Lannisters, who used him as a captive nobleman in negotiations, including an offer to exchange him for Sybell Spicer.\n\nDespite his imprisonment, Edmure’s influence persisted. He sent Robin Ryger to return Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, to Riverrun, showcasing his continued involvement in the war’s dynamics. His wife, Roslin Frey, is pregnant, adding a personal dimension to his captivity. During the conflict, Edmure was briefly liberated by Lord Blackwood during a battle, though his freedom was short-lived.\n\nThroughout these events, Edmure remained a central figure in House Tully’s affairs, attending key meetings and serving as a potential ally for Robb Stark. His nickname, \"the trout,\" reflects his family’s sigil and his connection to the riverlands. Despite his captivity and the challenges he faced, Edmure Tully’s resilience and strategic importance endured, marking him as a pivotal character in the broader narrative of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065180, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 414, "prompt_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 833, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
