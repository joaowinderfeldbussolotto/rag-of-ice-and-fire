She is deeply influenced by the religious fervor of Melisandre, the red priestess, and shares her unwavering belief in divine intervention and omens. Selyse is known for her strong adherence to the faith of R'hllor, often insisting that the god is the only ally needed in their endeavors.\n\nAs queen, Selyse accompanies Stannis in his campaigns and political maneuvers, including her arrival at Castle Black with her entourage. She attends significant events, such as the wedding at Castle Black, where her presence underscores her role as Stannis' consort and a figure of authority. However, her rigid beliefs sometimes lead her to oppose pragmatic decisions, such as when she discourages Jon Snow from leading a rescue mission to Hardhome, likely due to her conviction that R'hllor's will should guide their actions.\n\nSelyse's character is marked by her religious devotion and her alignment with Melisandre, which shapes her worldview and her approach to governance. Her relationship with Stannis is defined by both loyalty and shared faith, though her extreme piety occasionally puts her at odds with others who do not share her convictions. Despite her stern and unyielding demeanor, she remains a key figure in Stannis' court, embodying the intersection of political power and religious zeal.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067952, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 630, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
