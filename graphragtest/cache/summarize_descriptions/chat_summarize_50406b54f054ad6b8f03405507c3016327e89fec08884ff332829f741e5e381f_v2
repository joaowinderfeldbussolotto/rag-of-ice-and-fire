These cells are notorious for their harsh conditions, characterized by steep, sloping floors that make standing or lying down nearly impossible. Tyrion Lannister was held captive in these cells, enduring the brutal environment during his imprisonment. The Sky Cells are designed to expose prisoners to the elements, adding to their suffering and discomfort. Their precarious location and lack of proper shelter make them one of the most feared places of confinement in the realm. The cells' open-air design ensures that inmates are subjected to the full force of wind, rain, and cold, further exacerbating their misery. Despite their harshness, the Sky Cells serve as a formidable deterrent and a symbol of the Eyrie's unforgiving justice.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749064664, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 367, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
