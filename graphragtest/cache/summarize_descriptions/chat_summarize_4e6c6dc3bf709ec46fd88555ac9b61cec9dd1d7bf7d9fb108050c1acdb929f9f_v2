Initially part of her protective guard, he follows Daenerys and recognizes her growing power, particularly after the hatching of her dragons. Though some accounts suggest he refuses to become her bloodrider, others indicate he does serve as one, demonstrating his deep commitment to her cause. Aggo assists Daenerys in her plans, carrying out her orders with dedication, including scouting missions and tasks such as repairing city gates.\n\nHe is notably perceptive, suggesting at one point that Daenerys’ black dragon, Drogon, may be the legendary Balerion reborn—a testament to his belief in her destiny. Whether as a bloodrider or a trusted member of her *khas*, Aggo remains a steadfast figure in Daenerys’ journey, contributing to her military and strategic efforts while upholding his loyalty to her leadership.
