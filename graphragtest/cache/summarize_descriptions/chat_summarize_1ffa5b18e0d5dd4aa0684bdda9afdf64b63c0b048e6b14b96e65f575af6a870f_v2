As the primary religious authority, it holds significant influence over the realm’s moral and legal frameworks, including conducting trials and administering punishments. The Faith is known for its strict adherence to doctrine and its role in maintaining religious order.\n\nAt one point, the Faith held Cersei Lannister captive, demonstrating its power to detain and judge even high-ranking nobles. The institution operates as both a spiritual and political force, with the High Septon serving as its supreme leader. The current High Septon, a more devout and reformist figure compared to his predecessors, has reinforced the Faith’s authority, emphasizing piety and strict adherence to religious laws.\n\nThe Faith’s influence extends beyond mere worship, as it plays a crucial role in the governance of Westeros, often intersecting with the monarchy’s rule. Its ability to imprison and try individuals, regardless of their status, underscores its formidable position in the realm’s power structure. The institution remains a central pillar of Westerosi society, shaping both faith and law under the guidance of the High Septon.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749078254, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 445, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
