Initially, she offers her services as a healer and midwife, attending to Drogo’s wounds and assisting Daenerys during her pregnancy. Despite her healing intentions, her methods involve blood magic, a practice that ultimately leads to dire consequences.\n\nMirri Maz Duur insists that Drogo is alive, even as he remains in a comatose state, and she performs rituals to save him. However, her actions result in Drogo’s continued vegetative state and the death of Daenerys’ unborn child. This outcome leads Daenerys to accuse Mirri Maz Duur of deceiving her and causing Drogo’s condition. Enraged by the loss of her child and her husband’s fate, Daenerys binds Mirri Maz Duur to Drogo’s funeral pyre as punishment.\n\nIn Daenerys’s visions, Mirri Maz Duur appears shrieking in flames as a dragon bursts from her, symbolizing her role as a mystical antagonist whose actions have lasting repercussions. Her execution by Daenerys underscores her complex legacy—both as a healer and as a figure whose magic brings about tragedy. Mirri Maz Duur’s character embodies the duality of her craft, serving as a catalyst for pivotal events in Daenerys’s journey.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066896, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 707, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
