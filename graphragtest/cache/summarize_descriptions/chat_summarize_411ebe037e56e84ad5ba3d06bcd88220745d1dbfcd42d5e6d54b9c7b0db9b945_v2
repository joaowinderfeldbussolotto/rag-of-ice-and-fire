He is described as a guard in command of Ned Stark's guardsmen and is notably associated with several key events in the narrative. Fat Tom is the one who interrupts a small council meeting with urgent news, though the specifics of this interruption are not detailed. He is also a figure of significance in the dreams of Theon Greyjoy, appearing as a deceased man, suggesting his death occurred prior to the events of Theon's storyline.\n\nAdditionally, Fat Tom is mentioned in the context of Arya Stark's hatred, implying he may have played a role in events that deeply affected her, though the exact nature of his involvement is not explicitly stated. He is also connected to the Walders, as his son is noted to have played with them, indicating some familial or social ties within Winterfell or its surrounding regions.\n\nOne of the most notable and controversial actions attributed to Fat Tom is his responsibility for the death of Lady, Sansa Stark's direwolf. This act likely contributed to the animosity directed toward him, particularly from the Stark family. Furthermore, Fat Tom is described as a servant or guard who went south and did not return, reinforcing the idea that his fate was sealed away from Winterfell, possibly during the tumultuous events following Ned Stark's arrest and execution.\n\nOverall, Fat Tom is a minor but memorable character whose actions and fate are intertwined with the broader political and personal conflicts of the Stark family and their allies. His role as a guard, his involvement in key events, and his eventual demise make him a figure of both narrative and emotional significance in the series.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065336, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 352, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 584, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
