During a critical moment, he seeks out **Ned Stark**, the honorable Warden of the North and Hand of the King, to deliver significant news. Littlefinger’s visit to Ned Stark is marked by his characteristic blend of charm and hidden motives, as he shares crucial information regarding the household of the late **Jon Arryn**, Ned’s predecessor as Hand of the King.
