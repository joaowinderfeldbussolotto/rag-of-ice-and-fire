The term can refer to both independent fighters and organized mercenary companies. One notable example is Bronn, a skilled and opportunistic warrior who is frequently referred to as a sellsword. Bronn serves as a mercenary and later becomes a key ally and champion for Tyrion Lannister. Similarly, Osmund Kettleblack is another figure associated with the profession, highlighting the varied roles sellswords play in warfare and political conflicts.\n\nThe term \"sellsword\" also applies to broader contexts, such as the possible profession of Griff, a mysterious figure whose background suggests mercenary activities. Additionally, Ser Jorah Mormont becomes a sellsword after fleeing to Lys, further illustrating the diverse origins and circumstances of those who take up the profession.\n\nBeyond individual mercenaries, the term can describe formal organizations, such as the mercenary company formed by Oberyn Martell in the Free Cities. These companies operate under contracts but may abandon their paymasters if circumstances change, such as the destruction of slavers, reflecting the often unpredictable and self-interested nature of mercenary work.\n\nOverall, sellswords represent a category of fighters who prioritize payment and personal gain over loyalty to any single cause, making them both valuable and unreliable assets in the conflicts of their world.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749064688, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
