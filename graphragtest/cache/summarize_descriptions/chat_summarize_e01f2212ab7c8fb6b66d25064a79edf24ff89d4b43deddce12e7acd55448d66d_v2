He is the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a guerrilla faction that opposes the Lannister forces and fights against injustices in the realm. Beric is renowned for his resilience, having been reported killed multiple times, including by Amory Lorch and the Bloody Mummers, yet he persists, earning the moniker \"Lord of Corpses\" due to his seemingly supernatural ability to return from death.\n\nOriginally serving under King Robert Baratheon’s banner, Beric was sent by Ned Stark to bring Gregor Clegane to justice for his atrocities. However, he was ambushed by Tywin Lannister’s forces, though he managed to escape. Since then, he has led the Brotherhood Without Banners in harassing Tywin’s foraging parties and conducting raids, including alleged attacks on Saltpans. His group is both feared and sought after, with figures like Gregor Clegane and Merrett Frey demanding to see him before their deaths.\n\nBeric is also known for his role in judging Sandor Clegane, who eventually joins his band of outlaws. Despite his outlaw status, he remains a figure of interest to powerful lords and ladies, such as Lady Amerei, who begs Jaime Lannister to help defeat him. Additionally, Jeyne expresses a willingness to marry him immediately, highlighting his complex reputation as both a feared warrior and a noble figure.\n\nThough his whereabouts are often uncertain, Beric Dondarrion remains a key figure in the resistance against the Lannisters, embodying both the ideals of justice and the ruthlessness of war. His leadership and mysterious survival make him a legendary and enigmatic character in the ongoing struggles of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063272, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 383, "prompt_tokens": 616, "total_tokens": 999, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
