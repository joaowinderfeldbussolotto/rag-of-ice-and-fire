Initially mentioned as sitting near the fire in the common room, Todder is depicted as a recruit assigned to the rangers of the Night's Watch, a group tasked with patrolling and defending the realm beyond the Wall. Over time, Todder demonstrates sufficient skill or dedication to earn a promotion within the ranks of the Night's Watch, distinguishing himself among the recruits. His presence in the common room suggests he is part of the broader community of sworn brothers, while his assignment to the rangers highlights his role in the more active and dangerous duties of the order. Todder's promotion further underscores his growing importance or competence within the organization.
