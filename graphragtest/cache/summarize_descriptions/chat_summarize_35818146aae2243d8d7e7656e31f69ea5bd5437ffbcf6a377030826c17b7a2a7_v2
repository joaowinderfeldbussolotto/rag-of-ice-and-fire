Chosen to represent her in the duel, he faces Bronn, the skilled and cunning sellsword who fights on behalf of Tyrion Lannister. Despite his knighthood and formal training, Ser Vardis is ultimately defeated and killed by Bronn during the trial. His role in the duel is significant, as it underscores the contrast between traditional knightly combat and Bronn’s unorthodox, ruthless fighting style.
