This title was claimed by Robb Stark following his declaration of independence from the Iron Throne, asserting his sovereignty over the North. The title is referenced in multiple contexts, including Renly Baratheon's offer of alliance, where it underscores Robb's newfound authority and the legitimacy of his claim. Additionally, the Reeds, a noble house from the North, acknowledge Robb Stark as the King in the North, further solidifying his rule and the loyalty of his bannermen. Catelyn Stark, Robb's mother, also references this title, highlighting its significance within his family and among his supporters. The repeated mentions of this title across different sources emphasize its importance in Robb Stark's leadership and the broader struggle for power in Westeros.
