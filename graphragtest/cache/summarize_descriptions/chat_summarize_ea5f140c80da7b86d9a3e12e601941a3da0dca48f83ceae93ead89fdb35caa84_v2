He is famously known for his strategic use of dragon fire in battle, a tactic that solidified his dominance over his adversaries. One of his most notable achievements was the conquest of Harrenhal, where he defeated Black Harren by deploying his dragons to destroy the formidable fortress. This victory marked a turning point in his campaign to unite the Seven Kingdoms under a single rule.\n\nAs an ancestor of later Targaryen rulers, Aegon the Conqueror laid the foundation for the Targaryen dynasty, which would govern Westeros for centuries. His legacy includes the creation of the Iron Throne, a symbol of his power and the unification of the realm. Through his military prowess and the might of his dragons, Aegon reshaped the political landscape of Westeros, establishing a centralized monarchy that endured long after his reign.
