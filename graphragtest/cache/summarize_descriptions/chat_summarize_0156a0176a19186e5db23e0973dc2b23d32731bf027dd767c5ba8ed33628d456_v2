A Lannister bannerman, he is infamous for his ruthlessness, including the murder of Elia Martell during the Sack of King’s Landing. His monstrous stature and ferocity in battle have earned him widespread dread, making him one of the most feared warriors in Westeros.\n\nClegane is known for his brutal actions, such as killing a newly made knight in a joust, showcasing his disregard for honor and chivalry. He commands authority and intimidation, as seen when he orders Arya Stark’s group to lead his men.
