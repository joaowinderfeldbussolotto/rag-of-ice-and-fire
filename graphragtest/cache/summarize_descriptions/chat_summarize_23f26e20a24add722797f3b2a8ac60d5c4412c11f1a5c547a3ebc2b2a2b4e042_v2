Bran fondly recalls memories of their childhood, including fishing together, and expresses a longing to see Jon again. Jon Snow, who is Bran’s bastard brother, is stationed at the Wall, serving in the Night’s Watch. Despite the physical distance and their differing circumstances—Bran’s journey of self-discovery and Jon’s duties at the Wall—their fraternal connection remains strong. Bran’s question about reuniting with Jon reflects the deep emotional ties between them, shaped by their shared upbringing in Winterfell and the challenges they have faced.
