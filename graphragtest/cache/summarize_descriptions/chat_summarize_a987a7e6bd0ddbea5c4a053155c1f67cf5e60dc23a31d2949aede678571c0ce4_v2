He is one of the Frey wards sent to Winterfell, where he interacts with Bran Stark and other children. Bran dislikes Little Walder, wishing he were his ward rather than his companion, as Little Walder is known to insult Hodor and Bran. He is described as tall and stout, often engaging in games with the other children at Winterfell.\n\nDuring his time at Winterfell, Little Walder is bitten by Shaggydog, one of the Stark direwolves, and is present at feasts, where he interacts with Rickon Stark. He is also one of the Frey boys who later interacts with Reek (Theon Greyjoy) at the Dreadfort. Additionally, Little Walder is involved in discussions about the line of succession within House Frey following the death of Stevron Frey, indicating his awareness of political matters within his family.\n\nLittle Walder’s life comes to a violent end when he is killed, an event that sparks a significant conflict between House Frey and House Manderly. His death serves as a catalyst for the broader tensions and eventual fight in Winterfell, highlighting the deep-seated animosities between the houses. Despite his youth, Little Walder’s actions and fate play a notable role in the political and social dynamics of the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076099, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 633, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
