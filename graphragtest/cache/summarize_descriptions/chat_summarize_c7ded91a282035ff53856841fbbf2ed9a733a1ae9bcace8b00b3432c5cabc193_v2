This religious entity holds significant influence over its followers, who often engage in rituals and sacrifices to appease their god.\n\nThe Lord of Light is worshipped by Gendry, a character who adheres to the faith, though the extent of his devotion is not fully detailed. Additionally, Stannis Baratheon and his followers are devoted worshippers of the Lord of Light, demonstrating the deity’s role in shaping their beliefs and actions. The queensmen, another group of followers, also adhere to this faith and advocate for sacrifices as a means of appeasing their god, further emphasizing the deity’s demanding and sometimes harsh nature.\n\nInterestingly, the wildlings, a group known for their distinct cultural and religious practices, are noted to have feigned embrace of the Lord of Light, suggesting either political maneuvering or a lack of genuine belief. This contrast highlights the deity’s varying reception among different factions, with some fully committed to the faith while others adopt it superficially.\n\nOverall, the Lord of Light is a powerful and influential religious figure, commanding devotion from key characters and groups, and playing a central role in their spiritual and sometimes political lives. The deity’s worship involves rituals and sacrifices, reflecting a faith that demands active participation and adherence from its followers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076453, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 277, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
