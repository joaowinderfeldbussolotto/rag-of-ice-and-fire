Originally a stronghold of House Darry, the castle was briefly reclaimed by Lyman Darry before his untimely death, marking a fleeting restoration of the family's control over their ancestral seat. The castle holds further relevance as a key objective for Kevan Lannister, who seeks to secure it for his son, Lancel, likely to strengthen the Lannister influence in the region or reward Lancel’s loyalty.\n\nAdditionally, Castle Darry serves as a notable site where the king’s party was hosted during the search for Arya Stark, underscoring its role in the political and military maneuvers of the time. This gathering highlights the castle’s continued importance as a place of refuge and strategy, even as control over it shifts among different factions.
