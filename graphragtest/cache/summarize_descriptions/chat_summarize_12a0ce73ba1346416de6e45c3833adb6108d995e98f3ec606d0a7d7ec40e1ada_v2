As the grandson of Lord Walder Frey, he held significant influence and was next in line for succession after his elder brother, Stevron Frey. During the wedding feast of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, Ryman was seated next to Catelyn Stark, indicating his high status within the family.\n\nFollowing Robb Stark's perceived betrayal of House Frey by breaking his marriage pact, Ryman Frey played an active role in the family's response. He led a contingent of Frey men back to the Twins, reinforcing the family's stronghold and preparing for further conflict. Additionally, he was tasked with leading a group to greet Robb Stark, though the nature of this encounter remains ambiguous.\n\nRyman Frey eventually succeeded as the Lord of the Crossing, ruling from the Twins, though his tenure was short-lived. He met a grim fate at the hands of Lady Stoneheart, the resurrected Catelyn Stark, who hanged him in retribution for the Red Wedding and the betrayal of House Stark. His death marked a significant moment in the ongoing feud between the Freys and the Starks, further destabilizing the already fractured political landscape of the Riverlands.\n\nThroughout his life, Ryman Frey was a loyal servant of House Frey, embodying the family's ruthless and pragmatic approach to power. His actions and eventual demise underscored the brutal consequences of the betrayals and vengeance that defined the era.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749072224, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 312, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 557, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
