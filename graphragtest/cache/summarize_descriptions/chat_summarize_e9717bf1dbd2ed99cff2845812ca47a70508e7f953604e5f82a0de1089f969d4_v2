Held under the guise of hospitality, the Freys and Boltons betrayed and slaughtered many northern lords, including Robb Stark, the King in the North, and his mother, Catelyn Stark. The event marked a severe breach of the sacred laws of guest right, which held deep cultural significance in Westeros.\n\nDuring the massacre, numerous bannermen of House Tully were compelled to bend the knee to the Iron Throne, effectively crushing the northern rebellion. The betrayal resulted in the deaths of many prominent figures, including Sansa Starkâ€™s brother, Robb, and her mother, Catelyn. Additionally, men from House Bracken perished alongside Robb Stark, further illustrating the widespread devastation inflicted upon the northern Houses.\n\nMerrett Frey, a member of House Frey, later claimed to have had no direct involvement in the plot, though his family played a central role in its execution. The Red Wedding decimated the leadership of the northern forces, leaving many noble houses in mourning and weakening the Stark cause. The event became synonymous with treachery and ruthlessness, cementing its place as one of the most shocking and consequential moments in the conflict.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077571, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 582, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
