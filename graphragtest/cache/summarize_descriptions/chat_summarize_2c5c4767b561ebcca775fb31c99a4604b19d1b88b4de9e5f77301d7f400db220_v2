They are famously reborn in Daenerys' pyre, marking a significant moment in the return of magic, as referenced by Hallyne. These creatures symbolize Daenerys's power and authority, serving as both a military force and a representation of her growing influence.\n\nBeyond their mythical and symbolic roles, dragons are also central to the political crisis in Meereen, where their destructive capabilities have caused widespread devastation. Their presence exacerbates tensions and shapes the region's fate, making them pivotal figures in the unfolding conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"dragons\" is used in a different context as a form of currency, though this appears to be a secondary or metaphorical reference compared to their primary role as mythical beings.
