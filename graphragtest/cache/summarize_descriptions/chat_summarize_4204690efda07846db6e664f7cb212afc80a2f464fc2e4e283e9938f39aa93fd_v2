She was the sister of Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne, and her murder became a significant source of conflict between House Martell and House Lannister. Elia was killed during the sack of King's Landing, an event that marked the violent end of Robert's Rebellion. Her death was particularly brutal and remains a deeply contentious issue, fueling Doran Martell's long-standing desire for vengeance against the Lannisters. As a princess of Dorne, Elia's murder not only deprived her family of a beloved member but also intensified the animosity between the two powerful houses, shaping the political landscape of Westeros for years to come. Her legacy endures as a symbol of the Martells' unresolved grievances and their quest for justice.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076309, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
