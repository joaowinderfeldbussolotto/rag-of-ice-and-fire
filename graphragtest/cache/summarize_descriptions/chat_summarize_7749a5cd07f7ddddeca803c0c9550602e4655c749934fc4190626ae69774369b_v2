Initially a Bloodrider of Khal Drogo, Aggo demonstrates deep loyalty to the Dothraki way of life, distrusting figures like Mirri Maz Duur and even killing a stallion for Drogo’s funeral. Despite his initial reluctance, he eventually recognizes Daenerys’ power after the hatching of her dragons, becoming one of her most devoted followers.\n\nAs a Bloodrider, Aggo is frequently dispatched on critical missions, including fetching Grey Worm and the Unsullied, scouting the southwest, and repairing city gates. He is also known for his strategic counsel, advising Daenerys against entering the House of the Undying and suggesting that her black dragon, Drogon, may be Balerion reborn. Aggo’s role extends beyond mere service; he actively confirms her orders and assists in executing her plans, solidifying his position as a key figure in her inner circle.\n\nAggo’s loyalty is further demonstrated through his actions, such as killing Cohollo, a rival within the khas, to protect Daenerys’ interests. Though he initially refuses to become her Bloodrider after Drogo’s death, he ultimately embraces his role as her protector and advisor. His journey from a skeptic to a steadfast supporter underscores his deep respect for Daenerys’ growing power and leadership. Through his actions and counsel, Aggo proves to be an indispensable ally in Daenerys’ quest for power and conquest.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066992, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 334, "prompt_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 693, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
