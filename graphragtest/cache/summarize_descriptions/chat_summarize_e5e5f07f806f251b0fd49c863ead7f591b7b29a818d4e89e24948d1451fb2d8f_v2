It is administered by maesters and healers to alleviate suffering or induce sleep. Notably, Tyrion Lannister receives Milk of the Poppy from a maester to manage his pain, demonstrating its use in medical treatment. Additionally, the substance is mentioned in Ned Stark’s dream, where it is associated with easing pain or promoting rest, further emphasizing its calming and analgesic properties.\n\nMilk of the Poppy is also referenced in relation to Khal Drogo’s healing restrictions, suggesting that it may have been withheld or avoided in certain medical scenarios, possibly due to its strong effects or potential risks. This indicates that while the substance is valuable for pain management, its use may be carefully controlled depending on the patient’s condition.\n\nOverall, Milk of the Poppy serves as a significant medicinal agent in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, valued for its ability to dull pain and induce sleep, though its administration may be subject to caution in specific cases.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749064820, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
