Little Walder is depicted as an interactive and playful figure, often engaging in games with Bran and others, suggesting a lively and perhaps mischievous dynamic between them. Despite this companionship, Bran harbors a desire for a more formal and protective relationship with Little Walder, wishing he were his ward rather than merely a companion. This implies that Bran may seek a deeper bond or a sense of responsibility over Little Walder, possibly due to admiration or a perceived need for guidance.
