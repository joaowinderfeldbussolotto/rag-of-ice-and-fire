The city or region is notable for its public burnings, a practice referenced by Salladhor Saan, and its language, which Arya Stark is learning. Lys holds personal importance for several key figures in Westeros and beyond. Ser Jorah Mormont fled to Lys with his wife, Lynesse, to escape punishment from Eddard Stark after being disgraced. The city is also where Varys, the Master of Whisperers, was born into slavery. Additionally, Lys was a place where news of King Robert Baratheonâ€™s death was reported, highlighting its role in the dissemination of significant political events.
