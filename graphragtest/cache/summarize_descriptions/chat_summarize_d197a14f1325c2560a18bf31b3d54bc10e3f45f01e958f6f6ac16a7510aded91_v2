Known for his derisive attitude, he is particularly noted for mocking Brienne of Tarth, a fellow knight, which leads to a confrontation where Jaime Lannister strikes him in response to his disrespectful behavior. Despite his abrasive demeanor, Ronnet pledges his loyalty to King Tommen Baratheon, aligning himself with the ruling power in Westeros. His actions and allegiances reflect both his pride as a nobleman and his willingness to engage in the political and social conflicts of his time.
