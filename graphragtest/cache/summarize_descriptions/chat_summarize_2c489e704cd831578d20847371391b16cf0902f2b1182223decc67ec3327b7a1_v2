Initially, the sword was given to Jaime Lannister by his father, Tywin Lannister, as a symbol of honor and familial pride. However, it was later passed to Joffrey Baratheon by his grandfather, Tywin, likely as a gesture of favor or to solidify political ties. This transfer underscores the sword's significance within the Lannister family and its role in their strategic alliances.
