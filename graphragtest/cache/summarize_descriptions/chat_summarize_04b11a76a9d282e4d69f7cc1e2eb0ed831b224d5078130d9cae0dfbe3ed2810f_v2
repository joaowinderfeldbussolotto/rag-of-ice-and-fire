They are a group of women dedicated to the solemn duty of preparing the dead for burial, adhering to strict vows of silence. Their role involves tending to the deceased with reverence, ensuring proper burial rites are observed.\n\nThe Silent Sisters are known for their involvement in significant events, such as preparing Cersei Lannister for her penitential walk of atonement. During this process, they shaved her head and stripped her of her clothing, symbolizing her humiliation and purification. Additionally, they are entrusted with the remains of notable figures, including Lord Eddard Stark, whose bones were delivered to his family by the Sisters.\n\nTheir order is characterized by their muted presence, as they communicate without words, reinforcing their commitment to their sacred duties. The Silent Sisters serve as a reminder of the cycle of life and death, providing a final service to the departed while maintaining the traditions of their faith. Their work is essential in the realm, ensuring that the dead are honored and laid to rest with dignity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075481, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 235, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
