This language and its associated cultural elements are still preserved and spoken in certain regions, maintaining a legacy that spans centuries. The Valyrian language is also linked to the mysterious glyphs inscribed on the Dragon Horn, an artifact of significant historical and magical importance. These glyphs suggest a deep connection between Valyrian culture and the mythical creatures central to its lore. Though the Valyrian Freehold has long since fallen, its linguistic and cultural influence endures, reflecting a rich heritage that continues to intrigue scholars and enthusiasts alike.
