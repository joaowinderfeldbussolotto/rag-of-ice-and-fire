As Roose Bolton's legitimate heir, Domeric's passing paved the way for Ramsay Bolton to rise in prominence, though under controversial circumstances. Roose Bolton harbored suspicions that Ramsay was responsible for Domeric's death, a belief that cast a shadow over Ramsay's legitimacy and standing within the family. Additionally, Lady Barbrey Dustin held Ramsay accountable for Domeric's demise, further fueling tensions and distrust toward Ramsay. Domeric's death thus became a pivotal and contentious event in the history of House Bolton, shaping the dynamics of power and inheritance within the family. His legacy remained a point of contention, reflecting the broader conflicts and rivalries that plagued the Boltons.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749070256, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
