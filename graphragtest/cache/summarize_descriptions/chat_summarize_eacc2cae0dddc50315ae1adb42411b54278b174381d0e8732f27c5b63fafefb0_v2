Bran Stark, curious about these beings, inquires about them with Osha, highlighting their presence in folklore. They are described as possessing profound magical knowledge and abilities, making them enigmatic figures in the history of the realm.\n\nAccording to legend, the Children of the Forest once inhabited the lands long before the arrival of humans. They are said to have made a significant treaty with the First Men, marking a pivotal moment in the history of Westeros. This treaty is often referenced as a foundational agreement that shaped the coexistence of different races in the land.\n\nIn addition to their historical and mythical significance, the Children of the Forest are also associated with the mystical aspects of the world. They are mentioned in connection with the three-eyed crow, a figure of great importance in the magical lore of the series. Some accounts suggest that they live in caves, further emphasizing their reclusive and mysterious nature.\n\nThe Children of the Forest are also noted in the context of trading with rangers, indicating that despite their mythical status, they had interactions with other inhabitants of the land. This detail adds a layer of realism to their otherwise legendary existence, suggesting that they were not entirely isolated from the world around them.\n\nOverall, the Children of the Forest are depicted as a race of great magical prowess and historical significance, deeply intertwined with the myths and legends of Westeros.
