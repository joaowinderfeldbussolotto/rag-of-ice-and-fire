As a feared leader of Clegane’s men, he enforces harsh rules on captives, instilling terror among those under his command. Gregor Clegane is infamous for his violent exploits, including the destruction of House Bracken’s lands and the killing of Elia of Dorne, acts that have cemented his reputation as one of the most dreaded figures in Westeros.\n\nA formidable warrior, he is often deployed in critical battles, such as when he was sent to command the van of Tywin Lannister’s forces. His combat prowess is further highlighted by his encounters with Lord Beric Dondarrion, whom he is said to have killed twice, though Beric was later resurrected. This feud has made him a prime target for Beric’s men, who seek vengeance for his atrocities.\n\nGregor Clegane’s nickname, \"The Mountain,\" aptly reflects both his physical dominance and his merciless character, making him a symbol of fear and destruction wherever he goes.
