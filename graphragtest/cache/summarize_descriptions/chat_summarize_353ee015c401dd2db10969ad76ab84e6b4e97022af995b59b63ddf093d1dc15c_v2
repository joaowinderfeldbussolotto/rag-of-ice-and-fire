The union with Hizdahr is strategically motivated, aimed at securing peace and stability in the city of Meereen, which Daenerys has conquered and seeks to govern. Hizdahr, a member of a prominent Meereenese family, represents the interests of the local aristocracy, and the marriage serves as a diplomatic effort to reconcile Daenerys' rule with the traditions and power structures of the region.
