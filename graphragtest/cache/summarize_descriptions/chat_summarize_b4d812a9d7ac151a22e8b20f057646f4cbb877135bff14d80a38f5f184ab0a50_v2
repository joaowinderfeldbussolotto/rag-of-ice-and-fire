It is the homeland of Missandei, a trusted advisor and interpreter to Daenerys Targaryen. The island holds deep personal importance to Missandei, who often speaks of it fondly with Daenerys. Known for its lush beauty and peaceful nature, Naath is described as a paradise-like place, making it a symbol of tranquility and safety in Missandei’s memories.\n\nDaenerys, recognizing its importance to Missandei, offers Naath as a potential destination for her to return to, should she ever wish to leave her service. This gesture underscores the bond between the two characters, as well as the significance of Naath as a place of refuge and belonging for Missandei. The island represents not only her origins but also a possible future, should she choose to reclaim her roots.
