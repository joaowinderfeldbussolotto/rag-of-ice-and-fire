Despite his age, he demonstrates remarkable prowess by unhorsing two younger knights in a tournament before ultimately being defeated by Ser Jaime Lannister. As a member of the Kingsguard, he is often seen fulfilling his duties with unwavering dedication, such as standing vigil for the fallen Ser Hugh of the Vale and waiting outside the king’s bedchamber. He is also known to accompany Lord Eddard Stark, informing him of King Robert Baratheon’s intention to participate in a melee.\n\nIn Daenerys Targaryen’s memories, Ser Barristan is recalled as a knight who once served the Targaryen dynasty but later aligned himself with the Usurper, Robert Baratheon, following the rebellion that overthrew House Targaryen. This complex history underscores his loyalty to the realm, even as it places him in a morally ambiguous position in the eyes of Targaryen loyalists.
