As a member of House Frey, he is implicated in the infamous Red Wedding, a brutal massacre orchestrated by his family against House Stark and their allies. Following the event, Merrett is accused of complicity in the betrayal and is subsequently hanged by Lem and Tom, outlaws seeking vengeance for the atrocities committed by the Freys.\n\nMerrett is also identified as the father of Little Walder Frey, whose death becomes a point of contention within the family. His role in the conflict underscores the Frey family's ruthless pursuit of power and their willingness to betray allies for political gain. Merrettâ€™s fate serves as a grim reminder of the consequences of the Freys' treachery, as their actions provoke retaliation from those they wronged.
