Their worship is deeply rooted in the traditions of the First Men, who brought their faith to the continent long before the arrival of the Andals and their Seven Gods. The Old Gods are not represented by idols or grand temples but are instead honored in sacred spaces known as godswoodsâ€”groves of towering weirwood trees with carved faces, where the faithful come to pray and seek guidance. These deities are closely tied to nature, embodying the spirits of the forest, the earth, and the natural world. Unlike the structured doctrines of other religions, the worship of the Old Gods is more personal and introspective, often involving quiet reflection beneath the weirwoods. The Starks, in particular, maintain a strong connection to these deities, viewing them as guardians of their ancestral home and way of life. The Old Gods are also associated with the mystical and the unseen, with some believing they hold sway over fate and the deeper mysteries of the world. Their influence remains strongest in the North, where the old ways endure despite the spread of newer faiths.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075697, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
