Jon presents the sword to Arya as a personal gift, which she cherishes and fiercely protects. Needle becomes Arya's personal weapon, one she keeps close at all times, even while sleeping on the streets during her travels. The sword represents not only her connection to Jon but also her resilience and identity. At one point, Needle is taken from her, symbolizing a moment of loss and helplessness in her journey. Despite this, the sword remains a significant part of Arya's story, reflecting her growth, struggles, and the enduring bond with her brother.
