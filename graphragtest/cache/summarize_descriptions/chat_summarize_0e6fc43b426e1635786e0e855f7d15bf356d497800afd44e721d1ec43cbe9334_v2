As a prominent northern house, they are known for their loyalty to the Starks, though this allegiance has been strained by internal strife and shifting alliances. The Karstarks are fierce warriors, with their spearmen forming a significant part of the northern forces that have opposed House Lannister in various conflicts.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, House Karstark played a notable role, though their actions were marked by both loyalty and betrayal. Some Karstark men were captured and subjected to harsh treatment, including starvation, by the infamous Mad Huntsman, a brutal figure in the war. Additionally, a group associated with the Karstarks was mentioned by Lady Smallwood as being involved in the search for Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, highlighting their active participation in the broader political and military maneuvers of the time.\n\nDespite their northern roots and traditional ties to the Starks, the Karstarks have also been involved in schemes that sometimes placed them at odds with their former allies. Their actions reflect the complex and often treacherous nature of noble politics in Westeros, where survival and power frequently dictate allegiances. Whether as loyal bannermen or as independent actors, the Karstarks remain a formidable and influential presence in the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067160, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 503, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
