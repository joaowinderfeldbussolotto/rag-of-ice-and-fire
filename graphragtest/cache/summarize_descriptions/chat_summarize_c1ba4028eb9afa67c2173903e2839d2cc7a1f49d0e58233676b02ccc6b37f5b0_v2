Known for his ferocity and loyalty, Grey Wind serves as both a companion and a symbol of Robb’s strength and leadership. Larger and less wary than his counterpart Summer, Grey Wind is fiercely protective of Robb, shadowing him closely during the events of the War of the Five Kings. His aggressive nature is evident in several instances, including his intimidation of Ser Cleos Frey and his violent reaction at the Twins, where he attacks members of House Frey.\n\nGrey Wind’s bond with Robb is deeply symbolic, and his presence often reflects Robb’s own emotions and instincts. After Robb’s death at the Red Wedding, Grey Wind is killed, and his head is gruesomely sewn onto Robb’s shoulders as a final act of defiance and mourning. Even in death, Grey Wind’s spirit lingers, as he is later sensed by Ghost, Jon Snow’s direwolf, in a dream, highlighting the enduring connection between the Stark direwolves.\n\nThroughout his life, Grey Wind is depicted as a formidable and fearless creature, embodying the wild and untamed nature of the North. His actions, such as joining in mourning and attacking outlaws, further emphasize his role as a guardian and extension of Robb Stark’s will. Grey Wind remains one of the most memorable direwolves of House Stark, representing both the strength and tragedy of the Stark family.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749062852, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 365, "total_tokens": 670, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
