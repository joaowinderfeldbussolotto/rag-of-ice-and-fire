According to Davos, THE SEVEN did not bring him a sparrow, suggesting a possible lack of intervention or assistance from this group in a particular situation. Additionally, THE SEVEN includes a figure known as the Stranger, who is associated with the Many-Faced God, indicating a connection to broader religious or mythological themes within the lore. The group appears to hold significance in the spiritual or cultural framework of the setting, though specific details about their beliefs or practices are not fully elaborated in the provided descriptions.
