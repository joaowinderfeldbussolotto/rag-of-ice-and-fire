Unlike other cities, it holds deep spiritual significance and is the only settlement the Dothraki do not sack, as it is considered hallowed ground. The city serves as the residence of the *dosh khaleen*, the revered council of former khaleesis who guide the Dothraki with wisdom and tradition.\n\nVaes Dothrak is central to Dothraki culture and governance, often referenced in discussions of their customs and history. It is a place of great importance, where the Dothraki must gather before considering war, reinforcing its role as both a spiritual and political hub. The city is also notable for its connection to Daenerys Targaryen, who resided there with Khal Drogo and was destined to join the *dosh khaleen* before her path diverged.\n\nKey events, such as feasts and significant confrontations—including the infamous clash between Viserys Targaryen and Khal Drogo—have taken place within its bounds. Additionally, Vaes Dothrak is mentioned in relation to historical artifacts, such as the original plinth of a statue, further emphasizing its cultural and historical weight. As the heart of the Dothraki people, the city embodies their traditions, power, and sacred laws, making it an indispensable location in their society.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749061376, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 365, "total_tokens": 669, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
