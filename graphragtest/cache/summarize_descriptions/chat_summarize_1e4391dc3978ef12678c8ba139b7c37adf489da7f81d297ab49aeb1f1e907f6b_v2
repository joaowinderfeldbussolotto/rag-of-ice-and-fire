It is notably crossed by the Roseroad at Bitterbridge, a key location along the major trade route connecting the Reach to the rest of the realm. Additionally, the Mander flows near Oldtown, one of the oldest and most important cities in Westeros, where it is controlled by the ironmen, a seafaring people known for their naval prowess. The river plays a crucial role in the region's geography, serving as both a natural boundary and a vital waterway for transportation and commerce.
