It serves as a central symbol of worship and spiritual significance, particularly within the godswood where Bran Stark frequently interacts with the Old Gods. The tree is notable for its carved face, a common characteristic of weirwoods, and is often depicted with red sap resembling blood, which weeps from its eyesâ€”a detail observed by Samwell Tarly during his studies.\n\nAt Whitetree, another significant location, a similar weirwood tree with a carved face holds importance, reinforcing the broader cultural and religious reverence for these trees. The Heart Tree at Winterfell, however, remains the most iconic, standing at the heart of the godswood as a focal point for prayer and communion with the divine. Its presence underscores the connection between the Stark family and the ancient faith of the North, embodying both historical and mystical significance in the lore of the region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075084, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
