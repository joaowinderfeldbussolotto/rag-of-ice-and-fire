He is the younger brother of Catelyn Stark and the uncle of Robb Stark, making him a significant ally in the Stark-Tully alliance during the War of the Five Kings. Edmure is known for his role in defending Riverrun, where he dispersed men to guard border holdfasts and engaged the Lannister forces, though his actions inadvertently disrupted Robb Stark’s strategic plans.\n\nEdmure’s leadership was tested during the Red Wedding, where his wedding to Roslin Frey became the site of the infamous betrayal orchestrated by House Frey and House Bolton. Following the massacre, he was captured by the Freys and later held as a prisoner by the Lannisters, often referred to mockingly as a \"trout\" in messages. Despite his captivity, his wife Roslin remained pregnant, adding a personal dimension to his political predicament.\n\nAt one point, Edmure was offered in exchange for Sybell Spicer, highlighting his value as a captive nobleman. However, he was later liberated by Lord Blackwood during a battle, though his freedom was short-lived as he was recaptured. Throughout his imprisonment, he remained a symbol of resistance and a potential ally for Robb Stark’s cause. Additionally, Edmure played a role in the return of Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, by sending Robin Ryger to escort him to Riverrun.\n\nEdmure’s character is marked by his loyalty to family and duty, though his decisions sometimes had unintended consequences. His presence at key meetings and his actions during the war underscore his importance in the political and military landscape of Westeros. Despite his captivity, his legacy as Lord of Riverrun and his ties to House Stark and House Tully remain central to his identity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075543, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 383, "prompt_tokens": 398, "total_tokens": 781, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
