A nobleman of great honor and integrity, he played a pivotal role in the political landscape of Westeros. He was the father of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and Jon Snow, the latter being his acknowledged bastard. Eddard was also the husband of Catelyn Stark (née Tully), with whom he fulfilled his late brother Brandon’s betrothal.\n\nA key figure in Robert’s Rebellion, Eddard Stark lifted the Siege of Storm’s End and traveled through the Three Sisters, contributing significantly to Robert Baratheon’s victory. He was known for his leadership and military prowess, credited with winning the Battle of the Bells. After the war, he found Jaime Lannister on the Iron Throne, witnessing the aftermath of the Mad King’s death. Eddard later served as Hand of the King under Robert Baratheon, though his tenure was marked by political turmoil.\n\nEddard Stark was a man of principle, often at odds with the corruption of King’s Landing. He discovered the truth about Cersei Lannister’s incestuous relationship with Jaime and the illegitimacy of her children, including Joffrey Baratheon. This revelation led to his arrest and eventual execution for treason, ordered by Joffrey. His death was a turning point in the War of the Five Kings, as his remains were mounted on a spike above the Red Keep, and his tomb was later placed in the vaults of Winterfell.\n\nEddard was also a figure of authority who took Theon Greyjoy as his ward and was known to punish those who broke the law, such as Ser Jorah Mormont, whom he forced to flee to Lys. His influence extended beyond his death, shaping the actions of those who knew him, including Theon and his own children. Despite his execution, his legacy endured as a symbol of honor and justice in Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749074029, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 423, "prompt_tokens": 1272, "total_tokens": 1695, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
