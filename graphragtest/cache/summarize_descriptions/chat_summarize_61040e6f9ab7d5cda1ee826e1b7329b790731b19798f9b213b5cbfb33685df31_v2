Initially, the Greatjon was known for his fierce and independent nature, which led to a confrontation with Robb Stark. However, despite this early challenge, the Greatjon ultimately pledged his loyalty to Robb, becoming one of his most staunch and vocal supporters. His allegiance played a crucial role in bolstering Robb’s claim to the throne and strengthening the Northern forces during the War of the Five Kings. The Greatjon’s leadership and martial prowess made him a valuable asset to Robb’s cause, embodying the fierce loyalty and warrior spirit of the North.
