Known for their involvement in the political and military conflicts of Westeros, House Piper has found itself at odds with several powerful factions. Notably, the house has been in conflict with House Frey, a rivalry that underscores the complex and often volatile relationships between noble families in the region.\n\nAdditionally, House Piper suffered a significant military defeat at the hands of Jaime Lannister, whose forces decisively crushed their own. This event highlights the house's struggles against more dominant powers in Westeros, further emphasizing their precarious position in the broader political landscape. Despite these setbacks, House Piper remains a recognized noble house, though their influence and strength appear to have been diminished by these conflicts.
