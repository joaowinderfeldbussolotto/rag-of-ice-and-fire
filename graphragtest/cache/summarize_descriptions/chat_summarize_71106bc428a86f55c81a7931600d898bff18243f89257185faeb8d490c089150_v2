He is one of Lord Walder Frey’s many sons and played a notable role during Robb Stark’s war campaign, where he was recognized by Theon Greyjoy. Hosteen Frey also accompanied Catelyn Stark during her time with the Freys, further establishing his involvement in key events of the era.\n\nDuring the infamous Red Wedding, Hosteen Frey participated in the massacre, where he was responsible for killing Lucas Blackwood. His actions during this event highlight his ruthlessness and loyalty to his house. Following the massacre, Hosteen Frey became increasingly distressed over the disappearance of several Frey men, reflecting the tensions and paranoia within House Frey.\n\nHosteen Frey is also known for his aggressive behavior toward the Manderlys, whom he openly accuses of being responsible for the death of Little Walder Frey. His accusations escalate into violent conflict, demonstrating his quick temper and willingness to act on his suspicions. His actions contribute to the growing hostility between House Frey and other northern houses, further destabilizing the already fragile political landscape of the North.\n\nOverall, Hosteen Frey is a complex figure—loyal to his family but prone to violence and confrontation, making him a significant, if controversial, member of House Frey.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066740, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
