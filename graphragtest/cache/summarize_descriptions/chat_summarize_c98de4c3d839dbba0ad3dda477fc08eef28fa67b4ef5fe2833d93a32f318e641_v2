They are closely associated with weirwood trees, which are central to their worship, often found in sacred groves known as godswoods. The Old Gods hold significant spiritual importance, particularly in the North, where they are revered by prominent figures such as Sansa Stark, who prays to them and feels their presence watching over her. Additionally, the Old Gods are tied to the vows of the Night's Watch, reflecting their deep-rooted influence in the traditions and beliefs of those who uphold the old ways. Their worship is characterized by a connection to nature and the mystical, with the godswood serving as a place of communion and reverence. Unlike the structured faiths of other regions, the Old Gods represent a more primal and ancestral form of spirituality, deeply embedded in the history and culture of the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065660, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
