This gathering is a traditional assembly of the Ironborn to determine the next ruler of the Iron Islands, reflecting the region's deep-rooted customs and political processes. The mention of Pebbleton in subsequent chapters underscores its importance in the unfolding story, suggesting it may play a continued role in the events of the Iron Islands.
