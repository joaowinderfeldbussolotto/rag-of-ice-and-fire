She is notably mentioned as a potential bride for Tyrion Lannister, a prospect that is used as a threat or a means of coercion by Tywin Lannister, Tyrion’s father. Her name is brought up in discussions regarding Tyrion’s marriage, suggesting that the union would be undesirable or punitive in nature.\n\nAdditionally, Lollys is known to be the fiancée of Bronn, a skilled sellsword and later a knight in service to House Lannister.
