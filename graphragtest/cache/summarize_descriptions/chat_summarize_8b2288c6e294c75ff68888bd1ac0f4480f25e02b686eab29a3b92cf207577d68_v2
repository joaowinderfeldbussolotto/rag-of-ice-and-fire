As the head of House Tully, he was the father of Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure Tully. His leadership and influence extended beyond his immediate family, as he played a key role in political and social events, including seating Jaime Lannister next to Lysa during a past gathering.\n\nHoster was also the ward of Petyr Baelish at Riverrun, a relationship that later influenced his family's dynamics. His lineage traces back to Tytos Blackwood, and he was once sent as a hostage to King's Landing, reflecting the complex political landscape of his time. A notable aspect of his life was his strained relationship with his younger brother, Ser Brynden Tully, known as the Blackfish, with whom he had a long-standing feud.\n\nAs Lord of Riverrun, Hoster Tully was a central figure in the governance and defense of the Riverlands, shaping the region's history and the future of his house.
