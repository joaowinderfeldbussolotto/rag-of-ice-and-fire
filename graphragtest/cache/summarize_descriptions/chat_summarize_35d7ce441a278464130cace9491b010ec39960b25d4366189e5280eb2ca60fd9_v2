Described as silver-and-smoke in color with striking yellow-gold eyes, Summer is known for his keen intelligence and observant nature. He plays a crucial role in Bran's life, providing both protection and companionship as Bran navigates his journey.\n\nSummer is often seen by Bran's side, whether in the godswood, the crypts of Winterfell, or during their travels north in search of the Three-Eyed Raven. Bran frequently skinchanges into Summer, using the direwolf's senses and strength to investigate threats or explore his surroundings. This bond allows Bran to experience the world through Summer's eyes, enhancing his awareness and abilities.\n\nSummer is also a fierce protector, actively defending Bran and his companions. He fights alongside Bran, including battles against wights and other direwolves, such as Shaggydog. His presence is a source of comfort to Bran, as seen when Summer jumps onto Bran's legs after he wakes or howls in response to Bran's distress.\n\nAs one of the Stark direwolves, Summer is deeply entwined with the Stark family's legacy. He is sensed by Ghost, another Stark direwolf, and is recognized for his role in the family's struggles. Summer's actions, whether attacking outlaws or the Thenns (initially mistaken for other direwolves), demonstrate his loyalty and bravery.\n\nOverall, Summer is more than just a direwolfâ€”he is an extension of Bran himself, a guardian, and a vital part of Bran's journey as he embraces his destiny.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749062144, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 518, "total_tokens": 859, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
