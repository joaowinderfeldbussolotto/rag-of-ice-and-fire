Initially, they serve as sworn protectors of Khal Drogo, a Dothraki leader, and are bound by oath to defend him with their lives. As part of Drogo’s khalasar, they accompany him in his campaigns, assist in his actions—such as seizing Viserys Targaryen—and share everything with him except his horses, reflecting their deep bond as sworn brothers. They also gift weapons to Daenerys Targaryen, signifying their respect and allegiance to her as the khal’s wife.\n\nAfter Khal Drogo’s death, the Bloodriders’ loyalty shifts to Daenerys, who becomes their leader. They continue to serve as her elite warriors, scouting ahead for her khalasar and acting as her personal guards. Notable Bloodriders in her service include Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo, who play key roles in her campaigns. Daenerys also attempts to appoint new Bloodriders from her khas, reinforcing their role as protectors of a Dothraki leader.\n\nThroughout their service, the Bloodriders remain unwavering in their devotion, whether to Khal Drogo or Daenerys, embodying the Dothraki ideals of loyalty, strength, and honor.
