As a member of her *khas* (a group of elite Dothraki warriors), he plays a significant role in her inner circle, assisting in rituals and demonstrating loyalty to her cause. His recognition of Daenerys' power is solidified after the hatching of her dragons, further cementing his allegiance to her.\n\nRakharo serves as one of Daenerys' bloodriders, a position of great honor and responsibility among the Dothraki. He is tasked with various missions, including scouting the south and later overseeing the improvement of a plaza to promote grass growth, showcasing his versatility and trustworthiness. Additionally, he is sent to scout a city and is later assigned to explore Qarth, highlighting his role as a key scout and advisor in Daenerys' service.\n\nDespite his loyalty, Rakharo initially refuses to become Daenerys' bloodrider after the death of Khal Drogo, demonstrating his complex relationship with tradition and duty. He is also known for killing a stallion as part of Drogo's funeral rites, underscoring his adherence to Dothraki customs. Furthermore, Rakharo becomes a subject of argument between Irri and Jhiqui, two of Daenerys' handmaidens, indicating his influence and the varying opinions surrounding his role within her entourage.\n\nThroughout his service, Rakharo remains a steadfast and formidable figure, balancing his Dothraki heritage with his commitment to Daenerys' growing power and ambitions.
