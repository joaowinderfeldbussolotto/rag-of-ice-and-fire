He is a trusted and capable leader, often tasked with critical missions by high-ranking officials, including Tyrion Lannister. Ser Jacelyn is notably summoned by Tyrion to the Gate of the Gods, where he receives important instructions, demonstrating his role as a reliable enforcer of the Lannister regime.\n\nOne of his significant responsibilities includes the capture of Lord Gyles' party and ensuring the safety of Prince Tommen Baratheon, highlighting his role in protecting the royal family during times of political turmoil. Despite his competence, Ser Jacelyn faces challenges, such as his inability to locate Arya Stark, a task that underscores the difficulties of maintaining order in a chaotic and war-torn city.\n\nTyrion Lannister references Ser Jacelyn in his instructions to Lancel Lannister, further emphasizing his authority and involvement in the strategic operations of the City Watch. As a commander, he is expected to uphold law and order, though his limitations are evident in his failure to track down Arya Stark.
