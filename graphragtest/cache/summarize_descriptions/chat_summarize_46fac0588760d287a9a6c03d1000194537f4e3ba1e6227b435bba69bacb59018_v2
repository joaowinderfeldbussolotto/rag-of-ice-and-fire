In a tense confrontation, Yoren stands firm against the Gold Cloaks to shield Arya Stark, a young girl under his care, demonstrating his commitment to safeguarding those in his charge. His defiance extends further when he rejects the Gold Cloaks' arrest warrant for Gendry, often referred to as \"the Bull,\" refusing to comply with their demands. Yoren's boldness escalates as he openly threatens the Gold Cloaks, compelling them to retreat rather than engage in further conflict. These actions highlight Yoren's unwavering determination and willingness to confront authority to protect his charges, underscoring his role as a guardian figure.
