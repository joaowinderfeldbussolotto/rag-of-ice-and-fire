It stands in contrast to the older belief systems, particularly the worship of the old gods of the North. Central to its structure is the practice of anointing knights, a tradition that further distinguishes it from the religious customs of the northern regions. The Faith of the Seven is deeply embedded in the cultural and political fabric of Westeros, shaping both governance and societal norms. Its seven deities represent different aspects of divinity, and its followers adhere to a structured hierarchy that includes clergy and holy orders. The religionâ€™s prominence is underscored by its widespread adoption in the southern kingdoms, where it plays a pivotal role in the lives of both the nobility and the common folk. Despite its dominance, tensions occasionally arise between its adherents and those who maintain allegiance to the old gods, reflecting the broader religious and cultural divides within the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749059996, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 440, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
