It serves as a key site for Renly Baratheon’s forces, with remnants of his army remaining there even after his death. The location holds strategic importance, as it is where Catelyn Stark meets with Renly Baratheon to negotiate an alliance against the Lannisters, underscoring its role in political maneuvering during the War of the Five Kings.\n\nAdditionally, Bitterbridge is notable for a mêlée where Brienne of Tarth takes revenge on false suitors, demonstrating her martial prowess and resolve. The site is also where Parmen Crane, a knight of Renly’s Rainbow Guard, is sent, further tying it to Renly’s faction. Loras Tyrell, another prominent figure in Renly’s camp, is known to have headed to Bitterbridge, reinforcing its connection to the Tyrell family and their support for Renly’s claim to the throne.\n\nOverall, Bitterbridge is a location of both military and political significance, serving as a hub for Renly’s forces, a site of key negotiations, and a place where notable events, such as Brienne’s mêlée, unfold.
