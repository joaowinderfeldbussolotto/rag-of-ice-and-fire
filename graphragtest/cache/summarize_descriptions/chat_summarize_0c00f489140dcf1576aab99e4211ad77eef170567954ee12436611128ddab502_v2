He served as a sworn shield to Princess Myrcella Baratheon, accompanying her to Dorne as part of his duties. While stationed in Dorne, he maintained correspondence with Queen Cersei, though tensions were expected to arise with Areo Hotah, the captain of the Dornish guards. Despite his official role, Arys became embroiled in a forbidden relationship with Princess Arianne Martell, which ultimately led to his downfall.\n\nKnown for his courtesy, Arys had previously escorted Sansa Stark, treating her with respect. However, his loyalty to the Kingsguard was compromised by his personal entanglements. His affair with Arianne culminated in a fatal confrontation with Ser Gerold \"Darkstar\" Dayne, who killed him during a botched attempt to crown Myrcella as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Thus, Ser Arys Oakheart met his end as a result of his divided loyalties and the dangerous political intrigues of Dorne.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749068504, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 539, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
