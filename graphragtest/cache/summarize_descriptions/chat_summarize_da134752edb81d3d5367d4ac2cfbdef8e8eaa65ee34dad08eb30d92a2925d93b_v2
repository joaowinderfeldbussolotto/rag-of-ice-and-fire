They are known for their unwavering dedication to the Starks, often playing crucial roles in both defensive and offensive operations. The guardsmen are prominently involved in key conflicts, including the tense confrontation in the throne room, where their loyalty and combat skills are put to the test.\n\nDuring critical moments, such as the aftermath of Stiv’s death, the Stark Guardsmen arrive to assist Robb and Bran Stark, reinforcing their commitment to the family’s safety. However, their delayed arrival in this instance leads to a reprimand from Robb Stark, who scolds them for their absence during a time of need. Despite this, their presence remains vital in safeguarding the Stark household and upholding the family’s interests in the broader political and military struggles of Westeros.\n\nThe Stark Guardsmen embody the values of House Stark—honor, duty, and resilience—making them a formidable and trusted force in the service of their liege lords.
