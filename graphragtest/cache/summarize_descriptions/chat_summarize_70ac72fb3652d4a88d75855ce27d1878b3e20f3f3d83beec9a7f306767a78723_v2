Proposed by Janos Slynt as his successor for the position, Deemâ€™s reputation suggests a strong, if harsh, leadership style. His association with Janos Slynt, a prominent and often controversial figure, further underscores his role within the organization. Additionally, Allar Deem is connected to Chataya, though the specifics of their involvement remain unclear.
