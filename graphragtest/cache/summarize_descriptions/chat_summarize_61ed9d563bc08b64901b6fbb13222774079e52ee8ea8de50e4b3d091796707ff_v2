It is historically linked to the dragonlords and the Moonsingers' escape, as well as the origins of prominent houses such as the Targaryens and House Velaryon, who descended from its legacy. The city is often referenced in warnings and historical accounts, including Tycho’s stern admonitions, and is now considered extinct, its glory lost to time.\n\nValyria’s ruins are a site of both fascination and peril, as evidenced by Tyrion Lannister and Moqorro witnessing the fires of the Fourteen Flames near its remnants. Once a center of scholarly and arcane knowledge, Valyria’s downfall marked the end of an era, leaving behind only legends of its former grandeur. The Targaryens, who later ruled from Dragonstone, originally hailed from this ancient homeland, further cementing Valyria’s place in history as a cradle of dragonlords and magic.
