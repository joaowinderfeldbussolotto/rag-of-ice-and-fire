As Joffrey's uncle and Hand of the King, Tyrion holds significant authority over him, often advising and warning Joffrey about his reckless actions and poor leadership. Despite their strained relationship, Tyrion is tasked with managing Joffrey to prevent him from causing further ruin to the kingdom, demonstrating a sense of responsibility toward his nephew.\n\nTyrion is deeply involved in Joffrey's political and personal affairs. He discusses Joffrey's role in the death of Eddard Stark and critiques his political decisions, highlighting the consequences of Joffrey's impulsive behavior. During the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion takes responsibility for Joffrey's safety, ensuring his protection amid the chaos. Additionally, Tyrion presents Joffrey with a gift at his wedding, a gesture that contrasts with their often contentious interactions.\n\nTheir relationship is marked by tension and conflict. Tyrion threatens Joffrey to prevent him from interfering on his wedding night, underscoring the power dynamics between them. He also seeks to keep Joffrey away from the pyromancers, fearing that Joffrey's fascination with wildfire could lead to disaster. Despite these efforts, Tyrion ultimately admits to poisoning Joffrey, taking direct responsibility for his death. This act is a culmination of their tumultuous relationship, reflecting Tyrion's frustration and the extreme measures he takes to address Joffrey's destructive reign.\n\nThe discussions surrounding Tyrion's marriage and Joffrey's death further emphasize the intertwined nature of their fates.
