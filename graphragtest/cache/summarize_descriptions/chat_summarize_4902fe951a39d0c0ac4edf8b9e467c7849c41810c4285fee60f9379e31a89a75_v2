As a skilled and formidable commander, he has led Lannister forces in various conflicts, including battles against House Tully. His military prowess and strategic acumen have made him a key figure in the Lannister war efforts.\n\nJaime was once captured by Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings but was later released by Catelyn Stark under specific conditions. His reputation as a knight is further marked by his participation in a tourney where Petyr Baelish lost his dagger in a bet, adding to the lore surrounding his name. Despite the controversies and contradictions in his past, Jaime remains a central figure in the political and martial affairs of Westeros, embodying both the honor and complexities of his house.
