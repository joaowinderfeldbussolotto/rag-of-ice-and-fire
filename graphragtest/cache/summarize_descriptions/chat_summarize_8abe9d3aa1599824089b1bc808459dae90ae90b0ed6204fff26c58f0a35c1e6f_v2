Comprising key officials such as the Hand of the King, the Master of Coin, and other high-ranking advisors, the council plays a crucial role in overseeing the governance, political, and military affairs of the realm. It serves as the chief advisory body to the Iron Throne, making decisions on matters of state, including war, alliances, and appointments.\n\nThe Small Council has been a central institution in the political landscape of Westeros, often contributing to both stability and chaos. It was summoned by figures like Eddard Stark, who attended its meetings and argued against significant decisions, such as the execution of Daenerys Targaryen. The council also played a role in confirming Ned Stark’s temporary authority as Protector of the Realm, though it later sided with King Robert Baratheon in disputes against him. Under Queen Cersei Lannister’s influence, the council became a focal point for urgent and often contentious business, reflecting the power struggles within the ruling family.\n\nThe council’s responsibilities extend to discussing critical issues such as the progress of wars, responding to threats like Renly Baratheon’s murder, and deliberating on peace terms, including counteroffers to Robb Stark’s demands. It also addresses internal conflicts, such as the rebellion led by Jon Connington. Members of the Small Council have included influential figures like Cersei Lannister, Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish, and Jaime Lannister, further underscoring its role as a nexus of power and intrigue in the Seven Kingdoms. Through its decisions and debates, the Small Council shapes the political and military trajectory of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749062396, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 368, "prompt_tokens": 673, "total_tokens": 1041, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
