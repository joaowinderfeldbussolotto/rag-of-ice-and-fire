He is often present during Tyrion’s interactions and is sworn to secrecy regarding sensitive matters, such as the events at the docks. Podrick’s loyalty to Tyrion is evident in his actions, most notably when he saves Tyrion’s life by pushing Ser Mandon Moore into the river during a critical moment.\n\nInitially, Podrick follows Tyrion to the King’s Gate and remains a steadfast companion, aiding him in both daily tasks and more perilous situations. Despite his timid nature, he proves himself capable and reliable. After parting ways with Tyrion, Podrick later joins Brienne of Tarth on her journey, expressing hope that finding Sansa Stark might eventually lead him back to his former master. In this new role, he serves as a companion to Brienne, continuing to demonstrate his loyalty and dedication.\n\nThroughout his service, Podrick is characterized by his quiet demeanor and unwavering commitment to those he serves, whether it be Tyrion or Brienne.
