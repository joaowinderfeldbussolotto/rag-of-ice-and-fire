During the conflict, he formed a strategic alliance with House Frey, securing their support by agreeing to marry one of Walder Frey’s daughters. However, Robb betrayed this agreement by marrying Jeyne Westerling instead, a decision that deeply offended the Freys and strained their loyalty to his cause.\n\nThe Freys, led by the cunning and vengeful Walder Frey, sought retribution for this perceived slight. Their opportunity came during the infamous Red Wedding, a treacherous event orchestrated in collaboration with House Bolton. Under the guise of hospitality, the Freys invited Robb Stark and his forces to attend the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey. During the festivities, the Freys and Boltons turned on their guests, slaughtering Robb, his mother Catelyn Stark, and much of his army. In a gruesome display of their vengeance, the Freys sewed the head of Robb’s direwolf, Grey Wind, onto his shoulders, further desecrating his body as a final act of defiance and cruelty.\n\nThis betrayal marked a turning point in the war, demonstrating the ruthless lengths to which the Freys would go to uphold their honor and punish those who crossed them. The Red Wedding solidified their reputation as a house willing to employ deceit and brutality to achieve their goals, leaving a lasting scar on the political landscape of Westeros. Robb Stark’s downfall, precipitated by his broken vow and the Freys’ vengeance, underscored the perilous nature of alliances and betrayal in the game of thrones.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749083240, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 357, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 544, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
