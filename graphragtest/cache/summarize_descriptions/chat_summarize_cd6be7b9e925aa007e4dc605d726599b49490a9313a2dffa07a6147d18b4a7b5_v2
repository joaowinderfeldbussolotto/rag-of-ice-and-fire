As a septa—a member of the Faith of the Seven—she serves as both a religious guide and a strict guardian, ensuring the Stark children adhere to proper conduct and etiquette. She plays a particularly prominent role in Sansa’s upbringing, advising her on noble behavior and accompanying her to important events, such as the tourney and appearances in the throne room. Sansa holds her in high regard, often missing her guidance and presence, especially after her untimely death.\n\nSepta Mordane’s responsibilities extend beyond Sansa, as she also interacts with Arya, though her strict oversight sometimes leads to tension, particularly during tasks like packing. Despite her stern demeanor, she is a consistent figure in the Stark household, shaping the young women’s understanding of duty and decorum. Tragically, her life ends when she is executed as a traitor, leaving a lasting impact on Sansa, who remembers her fondly. Additionally, there is a notable moment where she is found asleep at a table, unresponsive to Sansa’s attempts to wake her, adding a layer of vulnerability to her otherwise disciplined character. Through her role as governess and mentor, Septa Mordane remains a pivotal figure in the early lives of the Stark sisters.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749061004, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 399, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
