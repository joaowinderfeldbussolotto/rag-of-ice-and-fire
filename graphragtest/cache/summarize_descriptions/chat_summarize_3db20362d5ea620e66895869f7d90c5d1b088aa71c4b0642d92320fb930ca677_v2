Initially a captive, he provides limited information to Catelyn Stark but later plays a more active role in diplomatic efforts. As an envoy, he meets with Tyrion Lannister to discuss Robb Stark’s peace terms and is tasked with delivering these terms to Queen Cersei in King’s Landing. Additionally, he is sent back to Robb Stark with the Lannisters’ counter-demands for peace, acting as an intermediary in the tense negotiations between the warring factions.\n\nCleos Frey also escorts Jaime Lannister to King’s Landing, further demonstrating his role as a trusted figure in Lannister affairs. Despite his initial captivity, he becomes an instrumental figure in the attempts to broker peace, though his efforts are ultimately overshadowed by the broader conflict. His dual heritage and knighthood lend credibility to his role as a messenger, though his loyalty remains primarily with the Lannisters. His actions highlight the complex and often futile diplomatic maneuvers during the war, as neither side fully commits to the terms he carries.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749069092, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 538, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
