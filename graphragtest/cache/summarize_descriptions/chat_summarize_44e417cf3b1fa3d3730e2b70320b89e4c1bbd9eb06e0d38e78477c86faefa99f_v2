After his death, he was reanimated as a wight, an undead creature, and became involved in a harrowing encounter with Jon Snow and Jeor Mormont. During this confrontation, Othor attacked them, prompting Jon to defend himself by setting the wight ablaze using burning curtains. The struggle resulted in Jon injuring his hand in the process. Othor was one of the dead men found near the Wall, and his reanimation played a significant role in the investigation of the supernatural threats beyond it. His transformation into a wight and subsequent violent behavior underscored the dangers posed by the undead in the region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065840, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
