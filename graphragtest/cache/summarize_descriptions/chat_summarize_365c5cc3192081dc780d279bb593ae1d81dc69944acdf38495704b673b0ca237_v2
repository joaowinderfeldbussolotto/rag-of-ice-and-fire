Their relationship is marked by tension and hostility, as Arya deeply despises Weese, likely due to his harsh and abusive treatment. Weese is known to beat Arya when she fails to follow his instructions, reinforcing a dynamic of fear and resentment. Despite the forced subordination, Aryaâ€™s disdain for Weese underscores the oppressive nature of their professional interaction, with Weese exerting control through physical punishment and Arya enduring his authority with clear animosity.
