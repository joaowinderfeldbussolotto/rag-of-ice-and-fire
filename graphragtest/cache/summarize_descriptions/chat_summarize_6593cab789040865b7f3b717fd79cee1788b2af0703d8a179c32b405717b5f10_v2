The Others are also known as enemies of the Night's Watch, representing a significant danger to the living. Their presence is signaled by three horn blows, an event that shocks characters such as Chett and Samwell Tarly. Beyond their mythical nature, the Others possess supernatural abilities, including the power to turn the dead into wights, further amplifying their menace.
