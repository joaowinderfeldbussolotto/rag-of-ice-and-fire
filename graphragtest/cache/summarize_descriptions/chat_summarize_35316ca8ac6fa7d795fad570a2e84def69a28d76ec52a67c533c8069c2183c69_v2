He commands significant respect among the Free Folk and plays a crucial role in leading the Night's Watch forces during the mission to Hardhome. Unlike many of his fellow wildlings, Tormund treats Jon Snow with notable respect, distinguishing himself as a key figure in the uneasy alliance between the wildlings and the Night's Watch. His leadership and strategic prowess make him a vital character in the conflicts beyond the Wall, bridging the gap between the wildlings and the forces of Westeros.
