A staunch follower of the old gods, he is deeply rooted in the traditions and values of the North. During the Red Wedding, the Greatjon was kept in a drunken state by Merrett Frey, which rendered him unable to effectively respond to the betrayal unfolding around him. Despite this, he played a ceremonial role at the wedding, carrying Roslin Frey to the bed chamber as part of the festivities.\n\nAs a key military leader, the Greatjon is known for his bold and aggressive strategies. He advocated for taking the fight directly to Tywin Lannister, demonstrating his willingness to confront powerful enemies. His leadership extends beyond the battlefield, as he has also seized control of Lannister gold mines, further bolstering his resources and influence. Additionally, the Greatjon played a pivotal role in bringing Rickard Karstark to Robb Stark, reinforcing his loyalty and commitment to the Stark cause.\n\nThe Greatjonâ€™s actions and allegiances highlight his significance as both a warrior and a political figure in the North. His devotion to Robb Stark and his strategic prowess make him a vital asset in the ongoing conflicts of the realm. Despite the challenges he faced, including the treachery at the Red Wedding, the Greatjon remains a symbol of northern resilience and strength.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066332, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 290, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 535, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
