Rowan appears to Theon, addressing his doubts and denying any involvement in murder, attempting to dispel his suspicions. However, the dynamic between them is fraught with distrust, as Theon questions Rowan about his past actions, particularly his capture of Winterfell. Theon’s skepticism extends to Rowan herself, as he suspects her of being a spy for Ramsay, adding layers of deception and uncertainty to their exchange. The encounter highlights the strained relationship between the two, marked by accusations and denials, as each navigates their own motives and allegiances in a volatile environment.
