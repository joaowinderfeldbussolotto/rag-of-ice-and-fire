Based primarily at Castle Black, the organization is sworn to protect the realms of men but remains neutral in political conflicts, such as those involving Stannis Baratheon. The Night's Watch is led by Jon Snow, who serves as its Lord Commander, overseeing the defense of the Wall and managing interactions with external forces, including the wildlings.\n\nProminent members of the Night's Watch include Jon Snow, Alliser Thorne, Samwell Tarly, Qhorin Halfhand, and the late Jeor Mormont. The order is responsible for training recruits, such as Jon and Sam, and maintaining vigilance against threats from the North. Despite its noble purpose, the Night's Watch has faced challenges, including desertions, such as that of Dareon.
