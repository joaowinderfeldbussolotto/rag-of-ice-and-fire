Cersei, dissatisfied with the High Septon appointed by her brother Tyrion, considers removing him from his position, reflecting her desire to control the Faith of the Seven. She expects the High Septon to appear before her, demonstrating her belief in her own authority, but is disappointed when he does not comply, underscoring the tension between them.\n\nTheir interactions revolve around the Faith's actions, particularly concerning Cersei's imprisonment and trial. The High Septon, wielding significant influence, oversees her trial and denies her requests, further exacerbating their conflict. Despite Cersei's attempts to assert dominance, the High Septon remains steadfast in his role, ensuring her accountability before the Faith.
