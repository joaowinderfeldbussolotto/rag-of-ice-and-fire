At one point, he agrees to accompany Catelyn back to Winterfell, demonstrating his loyalty to his family. Additionally, he has led a screening force, showcasing his military prowess and strategic acumen.\n\nThe Blackfish is also notable for his defiance and independence, as evidenced by his resignation from his post to defend Riverrun, prioritizing the protection of his ancestral home over other duties. His reputation as a warrior and his pivotal role in Riverrun make him a significant figure, even drawing the attention of Jaime Lannister, who considers negotiating with him. Furthermore, Ser Brynden is permitted to take the black, an option extended to him and any garrison members who choose to join the Night's Watch, highlighting his standing and the respect he commands.\n\nThroughout his life, Ser Brynden has remained a steadfast and resilient figure, embodying the values of honor, loyalty, and determination.
