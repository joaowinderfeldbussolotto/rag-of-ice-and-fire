He served with distinction during the reign of the Targaryen dynasty and was stationed at the Tower of Joy, where he played a pivotal role in the events surrounding the conflict known as Robert's Rebellion. Dayne was celebrated for his unparalleled skill with a sword, earning him a reputation as one of the greatest warriors in Westerosi history.\n\nIn addition to his martial prowess, Arthur Dayne was responsible for knighting Jaime Lannister during the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood, a significant moment that marked Jaime's formal induction into knighthood.
