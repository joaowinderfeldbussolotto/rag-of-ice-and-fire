It is a place where members of the Night’s Watch frequently stay during their rangings beyond the Wall. The Keep is known for its interactions with the Night’s Watch, as Craster provides shelter and supplies in exchange for protection and occasional assistance.\n\nThe Keep also plays a crucial role as a gathering point for survivors of the Night’s Watch, including notable figures such as Giant and Grenn, who escaped from the location after a conflict or dangerous situation. It is a place where the Night’s Watch encounters Craster and his people, often engaging in tense but necessary exchanges.
