Known for his humility, practical advice, and unwavering loyalty to Stannis, Davos serves as a key advisor and later becomes the Hand of the King. Despite being illiterate, he is resourceful and deeply devoted to Stannis, even after losing his sons in the Battle of the Blackwater, where he fought aboard the *Black Betha*.\n\nDavos's journey is marked by numerous trials. He is captured by Godric Borrell's men and later released, only to be imprisoned beneath Dragonstone, where he interacts with Melisandre. He also washes up on a small island in Blackwater Bay before arriving in White Harbor aboard the *Merry Midwife*. There, he seeks an alliance with Lord Wyman Manderly for Stannis and learns about the events in the North, including the fate of his son Devan. During his time in White Harbor, he is held captive and later imprisoned in the Wolf's Den, awaiting execution.\n\nA man of strong convictions, Davos declares that the Seven have never brought him a sparrow and considers trying another hawk, reflecting his pragmatic and sometimes skeptical nature. He plays a pivotal role in arranging Edric Storm's escape and confronts Stannis over his harsh methods. Additionally, Davos recognizes a man who cast a shadow, hinting at his awareness of darker forces at play. Despite his hardships, he remains a steadfast supporter of Stannis, even planning to kill Melisandre in retaliation for his son's fate. His experiences and actions underscore his resilience and dedication to his cause.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076045, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 554, "total_tokens": 919, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
