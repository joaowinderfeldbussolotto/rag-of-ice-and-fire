Due to Maester Aemon's blindness, Sam acts as his eyes, assisting him in various tasks, including tending to the ravens in the rookery and managing duties in the library. Their relationship extends beyond mere service, as Sam also provides care and companionship to the aging Maester, particularly during their time in Braavos.\n\nIn addition to his role as a steward, Sam accompanies Maester Aemon on a journey to the Citadel, the center of learning and knowledge in Westeros. Throughout their time together, Sam demonstrates loyalty and dedication, ensuring Maester Aemon's needs are met while also learning from his vast wisdom. Their bond is marked by mutual respect, with Sam benefiting from Aemon's guidance and the Maester relying on Sam's assistance in his daily responsibilities.
