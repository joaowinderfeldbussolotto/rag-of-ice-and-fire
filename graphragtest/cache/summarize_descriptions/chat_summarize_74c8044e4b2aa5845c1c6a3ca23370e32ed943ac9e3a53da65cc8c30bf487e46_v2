Prince Joffrey has complimented Sansa and shown her kindness, suggesting a favorable relationship between the two. However, despite these early signs of affection, his demeanor shifts over time. Later, Prince Joffrey orders Sandor Clegane, known as the Hound, to escort Sansa, indicating a change in his treatment of her. This contrast in behavior highlights the complexity of their relationship, where initial warmth gives way to more controlling or distant actions.
