WARG is specifically known as a type of skinchanger—a person capable of inhabiting and controlling the bodies of animals—with a particular affinity for leading a pack of wolves. This dual nature of WARG, as both a feared entity and a leader of wolves, underscores their mysterious and formidable presence. Their abilities set them apart from ordinary individuals, marking them as a significant and potentially dangerous figure in the context of their world.
