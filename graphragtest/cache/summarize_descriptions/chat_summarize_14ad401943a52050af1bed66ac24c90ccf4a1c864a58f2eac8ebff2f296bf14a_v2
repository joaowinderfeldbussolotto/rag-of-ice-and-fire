Traditionally, the family holds the title of Warden of the East and is known for its words, *\"As High as Honor.\"* The house has played a significant role in the political and martial affairs of Westeros, often involved in marital alliances and fostering disputes.\n\nCurrently, House Arryn is led by Lord Robert Arryn, the young and ailing son of Jon Arryn and Lysa Arryn (n√©e Tully), who previously ruled as regent. Jon Arryn, a prominent figure in the house, served as Hand of the King before his death, further cementing the family's influence. Lysa Arryn, sister to Catelyn Stark, also held considerable power within the house before her demise.\n\nThe house commands the loyalty of notable bannermen, including Yohn Royce, who owes fealty to the Arryns. Despite its strength, House Arryn has been perceived as a potential threat in broader conflicts, given its strategic position and military capabilities. The Eyrie remains a symbol of the house's authority, where Lysa Arryn once resided and governed with a firm hand.\n\nHouse Arryn's legacy is marked by both honor and intrigue, reflecting its deep involvement in the realm's politics and its enduring presence in the Vale.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749060704, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 675, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
