Originally the house to which the ancestral Valyrian steel sword Longclaw belonged, the weapon was later passed to Jon Snow by Jeor Mormont, a former Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Unlike many other northern houses, House Mormont has largely remained distant from the major political conflicts of recent times, having \"gone south\" and refrained from active participation in current events. Despite this, the house maintains its reputation for loyalty, courage, and a deep connection to its northern roots. The Mormonts are led by a fierce and independent lineage, often characterized by their unwavering principles and martial prowess. Their seat, Bear Island, reflects their rugged and self-sufficient nature, further emphasizing their distinct identity among the noble houses of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066860, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
