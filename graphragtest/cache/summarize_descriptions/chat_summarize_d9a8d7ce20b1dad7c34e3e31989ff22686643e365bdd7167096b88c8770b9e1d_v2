Known as the \"Young Wolf,\" he is a skilled warrior and military leader who outmaneuvered the Lannisters, achieving victories at Riverrun and other battles. Proclaimed King in the North, Robb commands the combined forces of Winterfell and Riverrun, leading a rebellion against the Iron Throne. He is the older brother of Bran, Arya, Sansa, and Jon Snow, and his leadership is marked by both strategic brilliance and political challenges.\n\nRobb’s campaign includes alliances and conflicts, such as proposing a pact with Balon Greyjoy and offering him a crown in exchange for attacking the westerlands. However, his marriage to Jeyne Westerling led to the loss of the Frey alliance, culminating in the infamous Red Wedding, where he was betrayed and killed. His death was orchestrated by the Freys and Boltons, marking a devastating turn in the war.\n\nAs a leader, Robb is both respected and feared. He beheaded Rickard Karstark for killing prisoners, demonstrating his strict sense of justice. He also sent his mother, Catelyn Stark, as an envoy to negotiate peace with the Baratheon brothers. Despite his military successes, his political decisions, including breaking his pledge to the Freys, contributed to his downfall.\n\nRobb is a key figure in discussions among major characters like Tyrion Lannister, Tywin Lannister, and Theon Greyjoy, who once fought alongside him. His demise is a significant event, with Joffrey Baratheon even demanding his head. Robb’s legacy as the King in the North and a symbol of Stark resistance endures, though his death weakens the North’s position in the war. His leadership, marked by both triumph and tragedy, cements his role as one of the most pivotal figures in the conflict.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749059767, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 408, "prompt_tokens": 1362, "total_tokens": 1770, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
