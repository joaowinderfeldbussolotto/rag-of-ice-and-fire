She was the wife of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the mother of their children, including Aegon Targaryen. Elia was a respected princess whose ladies-in-waiting included Ashara Dayne.\n\nDuring the Sack of King’s Landing, Elia was brutally raped and murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane, known as \"The Mountain,\" an act that became a point of deep contention and sorrow for her family. Her death is a key motivation for Oberyn Martell’s quest for vengeance and fuels the Sand Snakes' desire for retribution. Additionally, her murder is a source of tension between Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon, as it represents the broader atrocities committed during the rebellion.\n\nElia was held in the Red Keep during the conflict, where she met her tragic end. Her death remains a pivotal and sorrowful event in the history of House Martell and the realm, symbolizing the brutality of war and the enduring quest for justice by those who loved her.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749061508, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 373, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
