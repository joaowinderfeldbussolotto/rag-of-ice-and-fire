He is characterized by his black hands, which hint at his enigmatic nature, and he rides an elk, further distinguishing him from ordinary beings. Coldhands is unable to pass the Wall due to its ancient spells, suggesting he may be bound by magical restrictions or is not entirely human. Despite this limitation, he accompanies Bran and his group, aiding them in their journey to the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven, where Bran is destined to fulfill his greater purpose.\n\nColdhands exhibits unusual traits, such as not eating or sleeping, which reinforce his supernatural or undead nature. He has demonstrated his protective instincts by saving others from wights, the reanimated creatures that threaten the living beyond the Wall. Additionally, Coldhands is associated with the Night’s Watch, as he guides Samwell Tarly and Gilly, issuing a command to Sam to keep Bran’s survival a secret, indicating his involvement in the broader conflicts and secrets of the realm.\n\nHis actions and presence suggest a deeper connection to the forces at play beyond the Wall, possibly linked to the Children of the Forest or other ancient entities. Coldhands serves as a crucial guide and protector, ensuring Bran’s safety and the success of his mission, while also interacting with other key figures like Sam and Gilly. His inability to cross the Wall, combined with his supernatural abilities, makes him a compelling and enigmatic figure in the narrative.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077588, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 311, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 577, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
