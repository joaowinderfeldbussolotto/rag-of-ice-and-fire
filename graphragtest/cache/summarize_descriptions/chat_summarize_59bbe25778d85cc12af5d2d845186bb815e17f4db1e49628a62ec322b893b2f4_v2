In Meereen, the title is currently held by Barristan Selmy, who serves as a key advisor and leader. Similarly, in Westeros, the Hand is a high-ranking role, historically held by influential figures such as Mace Tyrell and Lord Eddard Stark, both of whom served as the king's chief advisors. The position carries significant responsibility, often involving governance, military command, and counsel to the ruling monarch or leader. Additionally, the Hand has been noted to hold displeasure with certain events, such as the tourney, reflecting the role's involvement in broader political and social matters. The title embodies both prestige and burden, as those who hold it are entrusted with the stability and administration of the realm or city they serve.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075147, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
