Despite any recent victories, Robb recognizes that Tywin Lannister, the calculating and ruthless patriarch of House Lannister, continues to command a powerful army that cannot be underestimated. With this in mind, Robb is determined to confront Tywin directly, preparing for an imminent battle against the Lannister forces. His strategic acumen leads him to plan an interception of Tywin’s army, aiming to disrupt Lannister movements and secure a decisive advantage. The looming conflict underscores the high stakes of the war, as both leaders maneuver to outwit each other in a struggle for dominance in the realm.
