She is described as a beautiful woman who became Edmure’s bride during a tumultuous period. Their wedding, part of the infamous Red Wedding, was marked by tragedy, as Roslin was carried away weeping during the bedding ceremony, a moment that underscored the sorrow and betrayal of the event. Despite the harrowing circumstances of their union, Roslin and Edmure’s marriage endured, and she later became pregnant with his child.\n\nFollowing the events of the Red Wedding, Roslin was taken to Casterly Rock, where she is being held, presumably as a political hostage or to ensure the compliance of House Tully. Her pregnancy adds a layer of complexity to her situation, as she remains under the control of House Lannister while carrying the heir of House Tully. Roslin’s role in the narrative is one of both tragedy and resilience, as she navigates the consequences of the political machinations that surrounded her marriage to Edmure. Her beauty and her status as Edmure’s wife and expectant mother make her a significant, if often overlooked, figure in the broader conflicts of the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077498, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 460, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
