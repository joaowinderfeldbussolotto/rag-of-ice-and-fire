She is the mother of Robb Stark, and her fate is a significant point of discussion in the narrative. As a member of House Stark, she once had Bronn in her service, though he later abandoned her. Her role extends beyond her familial ties, as she is also a key figure in political and military matters, having fought alongside Tyrion Lannister and tended to the wounded.\n\nCatelyn is deeply affected by the loss of two of her sons, which fuels her emotional turmoil and potential for vengeance. This is particularly evident in her interactions with Jaime Lannister, to whom she once held an oath but now harbors intense animosity. Her grief and desire for retribution make her a complex and formidable character, as she navigates the challenges of war, leadership, and personal loss. Despite her noble background and initial alliances, her experiences shape her into a resilient and determined figure in the unfolding events.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063944, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
