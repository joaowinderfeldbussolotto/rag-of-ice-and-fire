Originally a wildling woman from beyond the Wall, she is captured by Robb Stark and the direwolves after an attack on Bran, becoming the sole survivor of her group. Despite her warrior background and scars from fighting men, Osha is spared and taken into service at Winterfell, where she becomes a servant or companion to House Stark.\n\nOsha is known for her strength and resilience, often carrying Bran Stark and engaging in deep conversations with him about his dreams, the old gods, and the supernatural threats of the north, such as the Others and giants. She shares stories about the north and advises Bran on the dangers lurking beyond the Wall, including her observations of the red comet and the significance of the direwolves. Her bond with Bran and Rickon is evident, as she interacts with them frequently, even assisting Bran during feasts and discussing his visions.\n\nDespite her loyalty to the Stark children, Osha’s relationship with Theon Greyjoy is strained. She initially joins his service at Winterfell, much to Bran’s disappointment, but her allegiance remains with the Starks. When Theon betrays House Stark, Osha refuses to harm the direwolves and later begs Robb Stark for mercy, pledging her service to him. Her defiance and survival instincts are further highlighted when she escapes with Bran and Rickon during the chaos at Winterfell.\n\nIn a pivotal moment, Osha takes charge of Rickon and Shaggydog, sending others away and leading them south, possibly to White Harbor, to ensure their safety. Her actions reflect her protective nature and deep connection to the Stark children, despite her wildling origins. Osha’s character is defined by her strength, wisdom, and unwavering commitment to those she cares for, making her a memorable figure in the story.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749064556, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 509, "total_tokens": 910, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
