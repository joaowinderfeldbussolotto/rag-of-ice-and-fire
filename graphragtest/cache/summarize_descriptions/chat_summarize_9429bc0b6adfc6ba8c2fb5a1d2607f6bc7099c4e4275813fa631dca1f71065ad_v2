She serves as a religious and mystical advisor to Stannis Baratheon, whom she proclaims as Azor Ahai reborn, the prophesied savior. Melisandre wields significant power over Stannis and his followers, including his wife, Selyse, through her faith and prophetic visions, which she discerns through flames. Her influence extends to political and strategic matters, often shaping Stannis's decisions, though she is feared by many of his men.\n\nA figure of dark magic and prophecy, Melisandre is involved in numerous controversial acts, including the burning of Mance Rayder and the Horn of Joramun, as well as planning to sacrifice Mance’s baby for a spell. She is also responsible for the burning of the statues of the Seven, replacing them with symbols of R'hllor. Her actions are often blamed for misfortunes, such as the deaths of Stannis's sons, and she survives an assassination attempt by Maester Cressen.\n\nMelisandre interacts with key figures like Jon Snow, warning him of dangers and offering prophecies about his sister and the rangers. She discourages Jon from leading a rescue mission to Hardhome, citing her visions. She also plays a role in ceremonial duties, such as conducting a marriage ceremony, and advises Stannis on rising threats, including the emergence of new kings.\n\nHer visions reveal glimpses of war and future events, such as Arya Stark's escape. Despite her mystical abilities, she is not infallible, as seen when she seeks Edric Storm for a ritual, only to be thwarted. Melisandre’s beliefs center on the conflict between R'hllor and the Great Other, and she uses her influence to further Stannis’s cause, often through controversial and morally ambiguous means. Her presence is marked by both reverence and fear, making her one of the most enigmatic figures in the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076009, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 428, "prompt_tokens": 821, "total_tokens": 1249, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
