During his time there, he becomes involved in the search for Bran and Rickon Stark, the missing heirs of House Stark. Eager to prove himself, Little Walder suggests that the Reeds, a family from the Neck, may be involved in hiding the Stark children. He also actively asks to join the hunt for Bran and Rickon, demonstrating his willingness to participate in the efforts to locate them. As a ward of House Frey, his presence in Winterfell reflects the political ties and obligations between House Frey and House Bolton, who then control the castle.
