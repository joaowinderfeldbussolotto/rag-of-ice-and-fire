He is the brother of Margaery Tyrell and is renowned for his skill in combat. Loras served as a commander in Renly Baratheon's army, accompanying him in his flight from the capital and playing a key role in his forces. During this time, he was involved in a confrontation where he killed some of Renly's guards and departed with a portion of the troops.\n\nLoras later became a member of the Kingsguard, a prestigious order of knights sworn to protect the royal family. In this capacity, he was involved in the training of King Tommen Baratheon and supervised the guards assigned to his protection. His knowledge of Kingsguard history and his dedication to duty were notable. Additionally, he was present during discussions about the Kingsguard's traditions and responsibilities.\n\nAfter being wounded, Loras was last heard of on Dragonstone.
