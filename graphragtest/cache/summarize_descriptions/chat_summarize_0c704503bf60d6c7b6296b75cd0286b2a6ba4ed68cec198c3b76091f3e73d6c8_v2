Despite his diplomatic duties, Hobber is also recognized for his martial skills, though he suffered a notable defeat in a joust at the hands of Ser Meryn Trant. Additionally, there are indications that he, along with his twin, harbors intentions to escape, suggesting a possible desire to evade responsibilities or conflicts.
