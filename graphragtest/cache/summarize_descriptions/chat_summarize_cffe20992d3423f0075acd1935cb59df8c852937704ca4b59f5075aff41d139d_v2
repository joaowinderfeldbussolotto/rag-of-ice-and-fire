As the father of Margaery, Loras, and other children, he plays a central role in political and military affairs. Mace Tyrell is a key ally of Renly Baratheon, whose forces were instrumental in the siege of Storm’s End, where he famously feasted while Stannis Baratheon’s army suffered. His military prowess is evident, as he commands a significant force at Highgarden, with his vanguard led by Randyll Tarly. During the Battle of the Blackwater, Mace Tyrell’s army linked with Tywin Lannister’s forces to defend King’s Landing, where he commanded the left wing of the allied forces.\n\nPolitically, Mace Tyrell is highly influential, serving as Hand of the King and making critical decisions on the small council. He is known for his strategic alliances, including his refusal to accept Ronnet Connington’s request to prove loyalty in battle. His ambitions extend to court appointments, as he seeks to have his uncle Garth named Master of Coin. Additionally, he is involved in high-level discussions with figures like Jaime and Cersei Lannister, demonstrating his role in shaping the realm’s future.\n\nMace Tyrell also serves as one of the judges in Tyrion Lannister’s trial, where he questions Tyrion about his choice of champion in the trial by battle.
