Initially betrothed to Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon, she is an eleven-year-old girl who attends a tourney in King’s Landing, where she interacts with Joffrey and her younger sister, Arya Stark. Her desires and fears are evident in her interactions, particularly her infatuation with Joffrey, which leads her to betray her father’s plans out of love for him.\n\nAfter her father’s execution, Sansa becomes a hostage of the Lannisters, held captive in King’s Landing as a political pawn. She is mentioned in the peace terms between her brother Robb Stark and the Lannisters, and her disappearance is later noted in relation to a girl found with Lord Tywin. During her captivity, she is fitted for gowns by Queen Cersei and remains a prominent figure in the royal court, often seeking mercy for her father’s memory.\n\nSansa loses her direwolf, Lady, and is later betrothed to Tyrion Lannister, though this marriage is never consummated. She eventually disappears from King’s Landing, fleeing the Lannisters’ control. Later, she is mentioned as the wife of Tyrion Lannister, though she prays in the godswood, reflecting her enduring faith and resilience. Throughout her ordeals, she remains a central character in the story, embodying both the vulnerabilities and strengths of her noble lineage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749074390, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 577, "total_tokens": 901, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
