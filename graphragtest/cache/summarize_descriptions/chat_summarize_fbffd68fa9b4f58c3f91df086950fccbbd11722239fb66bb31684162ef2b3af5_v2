They are infamous for their betrayal at the Red Wedding, where they played a pivotal role in the massacre of Robb Stark and his forces, aligning themselves with House Bolton. This betrayal was partly motivated by Robb Stark’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which broke a prior marriage pact with the Freys, deepening their resentment.\n\nThe Freys hold considerable sway over Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, though their relationship is strained. They were responsible for the death of Ser Wendel Manderly during the sack of Winterfell and later brought his bones to the Manderlys, attempting to mend relations through proposed marriages. However, their past atrocities, including Wendel’s death, have left lasting enmity.\n\nAs advisors to Roose Bolton, the Freys believed in the inevitability of Robb Stark’s defeat and actively worked against the Northmen. They were involved in the siege of Riverrun and may have participated in attacks on Stannis Baratheon’s forces. Their presence in the North has been marked by tension, particularly after Edmure Tully’s return, which led some Frey members to depart.\n\nThe Freys are also known for their role in confirming the execution of Davos Seaworth, further solidifying their reputation as a ruthless and politically calculating house. Their bannermen and influence extend to various regions, including their involvement in the inn where key political discussions took place. Despite their power, their actions have earned them widespread distrust, particularly among the Northmen and other noble houses affected by their betrayals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075313, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 400, "total_tokens": 747, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
