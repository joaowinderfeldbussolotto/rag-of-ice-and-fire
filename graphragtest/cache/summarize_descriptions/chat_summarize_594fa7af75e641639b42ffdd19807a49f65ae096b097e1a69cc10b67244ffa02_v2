As the Lord of the Crossing, he holds power over the strategic river crossing at the Twins, where he has been known to imprison hostages to further his ambitions. His most infamous act is orchestrating the Red Wedding, a treacherous event where he violated the sacred tradition of guest rights by betraying and slaughtering his guests, including Robb Stark, his family, and his bannermen. This act solidified his reputation as a man willing to commit heinous deeds for power and favor.\n\nLord Walder is also noted for his secretive and calculating nature, often engaging in covert plotting with other powerful figures, such as Lord Tywin Lannister. His alliances and betrayals are driven by a desire to secure and expand his family's influence, regardless of the moral cost. Despite his advanced age, he remains a formidable and feared player in the political landscape, using his position and resources to manipulate events to his advantage. His actions have left a lasting mark on the realm, earning him both fear and contempt from those who know of his deeds.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077558, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 248, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
