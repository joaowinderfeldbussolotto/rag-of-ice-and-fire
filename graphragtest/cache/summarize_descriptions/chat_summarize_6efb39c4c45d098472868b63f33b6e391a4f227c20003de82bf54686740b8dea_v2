Known for his reliability and leadership, he was suggested by Catelyn Stark to oversee 400 archers and swordsmen at the Twins, demonstrating his trusted command abilities. As a commander of forces from the Twins, he played a significant role in military operations during the War of the Five Kings.\n\nHelman Tallhart was ordered to burn Darry and strike east toward Duskendale, leading his forces in a strategic campaign. However, his attack on Duskendale resulted in his capture, marking a setback in his military endeavors. Despite his initial successes, he was later reported dead in the battle at Duskendale, ending his involvement in the conflict.\n\nBefore his final campaign, Ser Helman had taken his best men south, a decision that left Torrhen's Square vulnerable. His actions reflect both his tactical acumen and the risks inherent in warfare. Though his fate was ultimately tragic, his contributions as a commander and his association with key northern strongholds underscore his importance in the political and military landscape of the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066776, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
