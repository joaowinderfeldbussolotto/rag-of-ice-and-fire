It is a grand hall where key meetings, greetings, and ceremonies are held, reflecting its role as a hub of political and social activity in the castle. Notably, the hall is also the setting for a poignant moment involving Bran Stark, who is carried into the hall by his loyal companion, Hodor. This scene underscores the hall's importance not only as a formal space but also as a backdrop for personal and emotional narratives within the broader story of Winterfell.
