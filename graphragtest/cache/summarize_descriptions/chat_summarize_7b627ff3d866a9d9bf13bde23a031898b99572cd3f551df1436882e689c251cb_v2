Kevan is Jaime's uncle, being the younger brother of Tywin Lannister, Jaime's father. Their interactions extend beyond family ties, as they both serve on the small council, where they collaborate on matters of governance and strategy. Kevan, a seasoned and loyal member of the Lannister family, has played a significant role in shaping the family's political alliances, including arranging a marriage for his son, Lancel Lannister. This demonstrates his influence and commitment to securing the family's interests.
