Renly, the younger of the two, bears a striking resemblance to their late brother, Robert, which contributes to his charisma and ability to garner widespread support. Despite their familial bond, the siblings find themselves on opposing sides, each vying for power and legitimacy in the wake of Robert’s death.\n\nStannis, known for his stern and unyielding nature, believes he is the rightful heir, while Renly’s charm and political acumen allow him to secure the loyalty of many noble houses.
