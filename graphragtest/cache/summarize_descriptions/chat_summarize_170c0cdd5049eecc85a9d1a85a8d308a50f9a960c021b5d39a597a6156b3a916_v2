As Robb’s constant companion, Grey Wind shadowed him throughout the events of the War of the Five Kings, serving as both a symbol of the Stark family and a formidable presence in battle. His ferocity was evident in multiple instances, including his aggressive reaction at the Twins and his role in attacking the Freys, demonstrating his unwavering defense of Robb.\n\nGrey Wind was particularly noted for his intimidating presence, even frightening figures like Ser Cleos Frey. His bond with Robb was profound, and he was fiercely protective of his master, often reacting with hostility toward those who posed a threat. Tragically, Grey Wind met his end during the Red Wedding, where he was killed, and his head was later sewn onto Robb’s shoulders as a gruesome display of the Freys' betrayal.\n\nEven in death, Grey Wind’s legacy endured, as his spirit was sensed by Ghost, Jon Snow’s direwolf, in a dream, highlighting the deep connection among the Stark direwolves. Grey Wind was also remembered for joining in mourning, reflecting the emotional depth shared between the Starks and their direwolves. As one of the direwolves that attacked outlaws, Grey Wind’s actions reinforced his reputation as a fearsome and loyal protector of House Stark. His life and death symbolized the strength and tragedy of Robb Stark’s journey.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075457, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 645, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
