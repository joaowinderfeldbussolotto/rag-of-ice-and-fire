His tenure in the Kingsguard was marked by controversy and failure, as he was ultimately stripped of his position for his inability to defend King Tommen Baratheon, an act that earned him criticism for cowardice. Despite his shortcomings, he remained a loyal servant to Queen Cersei Lannister, carrying out her orders on multiple occasions.\n\nBoros was involved in several notable incidents during his service. He was ordered by Cersei to check on Tyrion Lannister’s cell and later delivered a summons to him. Additionally, he escorted Sansa Stark to the small council, though his interactions with her were far from honorable. On the orders of King Joffrey Baratheon, he physically struck Sansa, contributing to her mistreatment and reflecting his willingness to follow cruel commands. His actions extended beyond mere obedience, as he also participated in the killing of gaolers at Cersei’s behest, an act for which he and Osmund Kettleblack were later reprimanded by Ser Jaime Lannister.\n\nBeyond his violent deeds, Boros played a role in delivering news to Cersei, further cementing his position as a trusted, if morally questionable, agent of the Lannister regime. He also made an unusual claim about Ser Robert Strong, asserting that he had never seen the formidable knight use the privy, adding to the mystique surrounding Strong’s true identity.\n\nDespite his tarnished reputation, Boros Blount was considered as a potential champion for Margaery Tyrell during her trial by combat, though this role ultimately did not come to fruition. His career in the Kingsguard, marked by both obedience and brutality, reflects the complex and often morally ambiguous nature of service under the Lannister rule.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065792, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 383, "prompt_tokens": 400, "total_tokens": 783, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
