He is a singer by trade, which led to his capture by Jaime Lannister from Ryman Frey, likely due to his association with the Frey forces or his presence in their territory. Despite his musical background, Tom of Sevenstreams also played a role in the discovery of Arya Stark, Gendry, and Hot Pie, claiming to be a Kingsmanâ€”a title that may have been a ruse or a misrepresentation to gain trust or authority. His actions suggest a resourceful and adaptable nature, navigating the dangers of wartime Westeros through both his talents and his wits.
