They are often depicted as spiritual forces tied to nature, particularly the sacred weirwoods, which serve as focal points for worship and prayer. Followers of the Old Gods typically engage in rituals and prayers beneath these trees, seeking guidance, protection, or communion with the divine.\n\nThe Old Gods are also notable for their opposition to R'hllor, the Lord of Light, representing a contrasting belief system. While R'hllor is associated with fire and light, the Old Gods embody the quiet, enduring power of nature and the old ways. This opposition highlights a broader conflict between different religious and philosophical traditions, with the Old Gods symbolizing a connection to the past and the natural world.\n\nThough their worship is often described in relation to prayer and reverence, the Old Gods themselves are not typically personified in the same way as other deities. Instead, they are seen as an amorphous, collective presence, deeply intertwined with the land and its ancient mysteries. Their influence persists in regions where the old traditions remain strong, and they continue to be a significant part of cultural and spiritual identity for their adherents.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077546, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
