Known for its squalid conditions, it serves as a slum area where the city's most vulnerable inhabitants struggle to survive. The district is infamous for its danger, with crime and violence being commonplace, as evidenced by a notable brawl between Tyrell and Gargalen soldiers that took place there.\n\nArya Stark, during her time in King's Landing, had interactions with Flea Bottom, highlighting its grim reality. She was known to trade pigeons for food in the area, underscoring the desperation and resourcefulness required to endure life in such a harsh environment. The district's reputation as a perilous and lawless place further emphasizes the stark contrast between the opulence of the Red Keep and the suffering of those residing in Flea Bottom.
