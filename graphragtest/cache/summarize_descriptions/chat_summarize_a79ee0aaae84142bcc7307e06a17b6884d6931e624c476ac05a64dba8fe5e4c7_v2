As a bloodrider, Cohollo is bound by a sacred oath to protect and serve Drogo, demonstrating unwavering loyalty. However, his allegiance takes a dark turn when he attempts to kill Daenerys Targaryen, likely due to his devotion to Drogo and the Dothraki traditions that may have viewed her as a threat or an outsider.
