Brienne is accused of killing Renly, suggesting a past conflict or involvement in his demise. This accusation casts a shadow over her actions and motives, implying a complex relationship between the two. Additionally, Brienne is questioned about Renly's death by Randyll Tarly, further indicating that her role in the events surrounding Renly's fate is under scrutiny. The questioning by Randyll Tarly suggests that Brienne's connection to Renly is significant enough to warrant investigation, possibly due to her loyalty or perceived betrayal.
