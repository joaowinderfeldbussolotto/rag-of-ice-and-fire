Bloodriders are elite warriors in Dothraki culture, bound by a sacred oath to their khal, demonstrating unwavering loyalty and readiness to die for their leader. Cohollo’s devotion to Drogo is exemplified by his ultimate sacrifice. In a desperate attempt to save Drogo’s life, Cohollo’s own life was forfeited, underscoring the depth of his commitment and the extreme measures taken by those loyal to Drogo. This act highlights the intense bond between a khal and his bloodriders, as well as the brutal and selfless nature of Dothraki traditions.
