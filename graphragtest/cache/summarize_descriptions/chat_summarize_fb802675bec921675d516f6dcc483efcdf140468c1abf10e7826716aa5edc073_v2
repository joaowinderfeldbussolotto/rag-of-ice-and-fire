They are infamous for orchestrating the Red Wedding, a treacherous event that resulted in the massacre of House Stark and their allies, solidifying their reputation as cunning and merciless players in the political landscape. The family maintains a strong military presence, with armed members stationed at key locations such as Castle Darry, demonstrating their readiness to defend their interests and exert control.\n\nIn addition to their military prowess, the Freys hold significant influence through their control over key figures. They are currently holding Edmure Tully hostage, leveraging his captivity to further their political ambitions. Furthermore, they have managed to subdue Jason Mallister, another notable figure, thereby expanding their dominance in the region. Despite their formidable status, the Freys have also faced setbacks, as some of their members were captured during a recent battle, highlighting the volatile and unpredictable nature of their conflicts.\n\nOverall, the Freys are a family marked by both their strategic brilliance and their capacity for brutality, making them a formidable force in the realm.
