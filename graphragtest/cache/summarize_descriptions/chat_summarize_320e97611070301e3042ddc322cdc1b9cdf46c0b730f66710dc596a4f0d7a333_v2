She was known for her association with prominent figures in the wildling community and played a significant role in the events surrounding the Free Folk. Dalla died tragically while giving birth in Mance’s tent, leaving behind a child whose fate became intertwined with others, including Gilly and Jon Snow. Her sister, Val, was another notable wildling woman who later caught the attention of Stannis Baratheon. Though Dalla’s life was cut short, her legacy endured through her connections to key figures in the conflict between the wildlings and the realms of men.
