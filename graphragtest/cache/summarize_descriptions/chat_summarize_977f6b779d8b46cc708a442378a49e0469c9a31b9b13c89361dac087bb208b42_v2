They invaded Westeros after the arrival of the First Men, bringing with them advanced technologies and cultural changes, including steel weaponry, the use of fire in warfare, and the worship of the new godsâ€”the Faith of the Seven. Their arrival marked a turning point in Westeros's history, as they conquered and displaced many of the First Men during the reign of Tristifer IV, reshaping the political and religious landscape of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe Andals are also noted for their destruction of the sacred weirwood trees, particularly at High Heart, symbolizing their rejection of the old gods worshipped by the First Men and the Children of the Forest. This act further solidified their dominance and the spread of their own religious beliefs. Their legacy is deeply embedded in Westeros's culture, as evidenced by their mention in Stannis Baratheon's declaration, which underscores their enduring influence in the realm's political and social structures. As invaders who brought lasting change, the Andals remain a pivotal group in the history of the Seven Kingdoms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749067400, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 492, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
