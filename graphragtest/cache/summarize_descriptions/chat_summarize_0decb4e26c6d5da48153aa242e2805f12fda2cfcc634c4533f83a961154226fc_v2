Initially, they are sworn to Khal Drogo, serving as his personal guards and sharing a deep bond with him, akin to sworn brothers, though they do not share his horses. They assist Drogo in his actions, including the seizure of Viserys Targaryen, and are known for their unwavering loyalty. As part of Drogo’s khalasar, they accompany him and play a crucial role in his leadership.\n\nAfter Drogo’s death, the Bloodriders transition to serving Daenerys Targaryen, becoming her personal guards and scouting ahead for her khalasar. Notable Bloodriders in her service include Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo. They continue to uphold their role as elite warriors, protecting Daenerys and demonstrating their loyalty to her as their new leader. Additionally, they are known to gift weapons to Daenerys, symbolizing their allegiance and respect.\n\nThroughout their service, the Bloodriders remain a formidable and dedicated force, whether under Khal Drogo or Daenerys Targaryen, embodying the warrior spirit and loyalty of the Dothraki.
