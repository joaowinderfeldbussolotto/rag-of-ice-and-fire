She is the sister of Dalla, the late wife of Mance Rayder, the former King-Beyond-the-Wall, and is deeply involved in the political and social dynamics of the wildlings. Val accompanies Jon Snow to meet Queen Selyse Baratheon, serving as a representative of the wildling people in negotiations with Stannis Baratheon. Stannis, seeking to solidify peace with the wildlings, intends to marry Val to Jon Snow for political purposes, though this plan is also pursued by Axell Florent, who seeks her hand in marriage for his own ambitions.\n\nVal plays a crucial role in assisting her sister Dalla during childbirth, demonstrating her familial loyalty and care. After Dalla’s death, Val becomes a protector of her sister’s infant son, whom Ramsay Bolton demands be returned, believing the child to be Mance Rayder’s heir. Val is determined to bring the baby to Mance Rayder, further emphasizing her commitment to her family and the wildling cause.\n\nAdditionally, Val is tasked by Jon Snow to locate Tormund Giantsbane, showcasing her importance as a mediator and leader among the wildlings.
