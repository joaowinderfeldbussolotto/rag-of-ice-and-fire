Known for their deep connection to the marshes and their expertise in navigating its perilous terrain, they play a significant role in the region's conflicts. During the War of the Five Kings, the Crannogmen are noted for besieging the Ironborn at Moat Cailin, demonstrating their strategic importance in the North's defense. Additionally, they prove invaluable to Robb Stark’s forces by guiding them through the swamps, showcasing their unparalleled knowledge of the land and their loyalty to the Starks.
