His role placed him in a position of significant influence and authority within Yunkish affairs. During the chaotic events at the fighting pits, Yurkhaz met a violent end when he was trampled to death during Drogon's attack. His death became a pivotal moment, as it was later used as a pretext by Hizdahr zo Loraq to justify his subsequent actions. This incident underscored the volatile and dangerous political climate in Meereen at the time, with Yurkhaz's demise serving as a catalyst for further conflict and maneuvering among the city's factions.
