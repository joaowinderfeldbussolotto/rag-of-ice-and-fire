Under the command of Cersei Lannister, he was coerced into confessing to bedding Margaery Tyrell and other women, a false admission likely extracted through duress or manipulation. Additionally, Ser Osney confessed to various other crimes while under torture, including implicating Cersei herself in the murder of the old High Septon. His forced confessions were part of a broader scheme to shift blame and protect Cersei’s interests, though they ultimately exposed the depths of deception and coercion within the royal court. Ser Osney’s role highlights the brutal tactics employed by those in power, as well as the vulnerability of individuals caught in their machinations. His actions, though compelled, had significant repercussions in the political and religious landscape of the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749078278, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 367, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
