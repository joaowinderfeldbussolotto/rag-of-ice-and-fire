He was the father of Catelyn Stark and the grandfather of Sansa Stark, making him a significant figure in both the Tully and Stark families. In his later years, Hoster Tully suffered from a prolonged illness, leaving him too weak to participate in important political matters, such as the mission to Renly Baratheon or other critical meetings.\n\nDespite his declining health, Hoster Tully remained a respected figure, known for his past actions, including coming to the aid of Robert Baratheon. His condition weighed heavily on his daughter, Catelyn, who wished to be by his side rather than engaging in political negotiations. Hoster Tully’s death marked the end of an era for House Tully, and his passing was noted in visions by the Ghost of High Heart, further emphasizing his significance in the realm’s history. His legacy endured through his family, particularly his daughter Catelyn and granddaughter Sansa, who carried on his influence in the political landscape of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075665, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 508, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
