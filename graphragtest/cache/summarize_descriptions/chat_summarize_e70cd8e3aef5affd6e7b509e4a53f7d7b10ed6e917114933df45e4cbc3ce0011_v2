Lysa is the widow of Jon Arryn, the former Lord of the Eyrie and Warden of the East, while Catelyn is married to Eddard Stark of Winterfell. The sisters share a close bond but have led distinct lives shaped by their respective marriages and political roles. Both played significant roles in the trial of Tyrion Lannister, with Lysa accusing him of orchestrating Jon Arryn’s murder and Catelyn supporting her sister’s claims. Their involvement in this trial highlights their deep familial ties and shared determination to seek justice for perceived wrongs against their family.
