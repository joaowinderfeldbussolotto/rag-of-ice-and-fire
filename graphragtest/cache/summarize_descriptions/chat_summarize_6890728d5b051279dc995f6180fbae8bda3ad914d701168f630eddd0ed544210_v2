As a loyal and fierce member of Drogo’s inner circle, HAGGO played a significant role in the khalasar. His devotion to Drogo was evident in his willingness to offer assistance and support, demonstrating his commitment to his khal.\n\nDuring a critical moment, HAGGO’s life was ultimately sacrificed in an attempt to save Drogo, highlighting his unwavering loyalty. This sacrifice occurred amid a conflict, where HAGGO met his end while defending or aiding his khal.
