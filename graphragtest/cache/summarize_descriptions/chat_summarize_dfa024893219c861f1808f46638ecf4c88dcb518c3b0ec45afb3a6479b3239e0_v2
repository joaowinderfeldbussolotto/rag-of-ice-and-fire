It serves as the ancestral lands of House Baelish, commonly associated with Petyr Baelish, known as Littlefinger. The area is strategically significant, as it was the route taken by Eddard Stark when he crossed the mountains to reach the Three Sisters, a group of islands located nearby. The Fingers' proximity to the sea and its challenging topography make it a distinctive and historically important location within the Vale of Arryn.
