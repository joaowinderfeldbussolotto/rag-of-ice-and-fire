As a skilled commander, he is particularly noted for his exceptional horsemanship and swordsmanship, making him a valuable asset in battle. Marbrand has served in various capacities, including as a former commander of the City Watch and later as its newly appointed leader following the death of Jacelyn Bywater.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Marbrand played a crucial role in screening military movements under Tywin Lannister’s command. He was tasked with monitoring and reporting on Robb Stark’s forces, demonstrating his strategic importance in the Lannister war effort. At one point, his forces were ordered to retreat south while continuing to harass the northerners, reflecting his adaptability in warfare.\n\nMarbrand also served under Jaime Lannister, who specifically requested his inclusion in his command as a concession, highlighting his reputation and trusted status among the Lannister leadership. Known for his pragmatic approach to conflict, he famously insisted that \"two battles do not make a war,\" underscoring his strategic mindset.\n\nThroughout his service, Ser Addam Marbrand has proven himself as a capable and versatile leader, whether in direct combat, reconnaissance, or administrative roles.
