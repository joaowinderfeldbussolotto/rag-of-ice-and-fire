Initially, Edmure Tully, a member of House Tully and heir to Riverrun, was set to marry Roslin Frey, a daughter of House Frey. The marriage was arranged as part of a strategic alliance, likely intended to strengthen ties between their respective houses. Following the wedding, Edmure and Roslin were married and are to be held at Casterly Rock, the seat of House Lannister. This suggests that their union may have broader political implications, possibly involving the Lannisters or other powerful factions in Westeros. The details surrounding their marriage and subsequent relocation to Casterly Rock indicate the importance of their alliance in the broader context of the realm's power dynamics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749083372, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
