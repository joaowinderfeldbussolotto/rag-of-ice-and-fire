His tenure in the Kingsguard was marked by controversy and failure, as he was ultimately stripped of his position for failing to defend King Tommen Baratheon, an act that drew criticism for perceived cowardice. Despite his shortcomings, Blount remained a loyal servant to Queen Cersei Lannister, carrying out her orders on multiple occasions.\n\nBlount was involved in several notable incidents, including delivering a summons to Tyrion Lannister and escorting Sansa Stark to the small council. However, his most infamous actions involved the mistreatment of Sansa Stark, whom he struck at the command of King Joffrey Baratheon, demonstrating his willingness to follow cruel orders. Additionally, he was tasked by Cersei to check on Tyrion’s cell, further illustrating his role as an enforcer of her will.\n\nHis loyalty to Cersei extended to violent acts, as he, alongside Osmund Kettleblack, killed two gaolers on her orders, though he was later reprimanded by Ser Jaime Lannister for this action. Blount also played a role in delivering news to Cersei, reinforcing his position as a trusted, if morally questionable, agent of the crown.\n\nBeyond his duties, Blount was known for his peculiar claim of never having seen Ser Robert Strong use the privy, adding an odd footnote to his character. Despite his tarnished reputation, he was considered as a potential champion for Margaery Tyrell, though this role never materialized. Ser Boros Blount’s legacy is one of flawed loyalty, marked by both obedience to authority and a willingness to engage in brutality when commanded.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075656, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 746, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
