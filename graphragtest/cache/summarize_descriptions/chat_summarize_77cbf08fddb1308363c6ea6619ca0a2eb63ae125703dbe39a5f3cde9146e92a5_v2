Described in the *Jade Compendium* as both bright and fearfully hot, it is a weapon of significant mythological and martial importance. Stannis wields Lightbringer, drawing it from the fire as proclaimed by Melisandre, the Red Priestess, who declares it to be the fabled sword of Azor Ahai, a prophesied hero. The blade is not only a physical weapon but also a symbol of divine favor, linked to the faith of the Lord of Light.\n\nLightbringer is notably used by Stannis in a dramatic act of justice, as he draws the sword to behead Davos Seaworth, though the context of this event remains significant in Stannis' rule. Its fiery and radiant nature aligns with its legendary status, reinforcing its role as a weapon of both power and prophecy. The sword’s association with Stannis and its proclamation as Azor Ahai’s blade underscore its central place in the lore of the Lord of Light and the broader narrative of destiny and leadership.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749069488, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 477, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
