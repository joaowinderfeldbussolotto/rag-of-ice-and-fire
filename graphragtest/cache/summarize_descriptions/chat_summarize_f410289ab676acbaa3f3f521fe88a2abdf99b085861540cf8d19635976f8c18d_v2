Nymeria, a fierce and aggressive creature, attacked Joffrey, resulting in significant consequences. During the altercation, Nymeria savaged Joffrey's arm, inflicting a lasting injury that would have long-term repercussions for him. The intensity of the attack was such that Joffrey was forced to drop his sword, leaving him defenseless and vulnerable. The encounter underscores Nymeria's ferocity and Joffrey's inability to defend himself effectively in the face of her aggression. The incident likely left a lasting impact on both parties, with Joffrey bearing physical and possibly psychological scars from the confrontation.
