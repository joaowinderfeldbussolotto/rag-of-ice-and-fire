Renowned for their brutality, they are infamous for acts of violence, including rape, and are involved in significant events at Harrenhal. The group includes brutal fighters such as Shagwell, Urswyck, and Rorge, who contribute to their fearsome reputation.\n\nThe Bloody Mummers are known for capturing northmen and bringing them to Harrenhal, where they play a key role in the conflicts unfolding there. They also held a septry at one point but were eventually defeated by the Brotherhood Without Banners. Their cruelty is further exemplified by their treatment of captives, such as parading Ser Amory Lorch and feeding him to a bear.\n\nBrienne of Tarth has had multiple encounters with the group, including an attempted rape by its members, though she managed to kill three of them in self-defense. Jaime Lannister, during his captivity, requested to be sent to the Bloody Mummers if captured, highlighting their feared status. Their actions and reputation make them one of the most dreaded mercenary bands in the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749071744, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 594, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
