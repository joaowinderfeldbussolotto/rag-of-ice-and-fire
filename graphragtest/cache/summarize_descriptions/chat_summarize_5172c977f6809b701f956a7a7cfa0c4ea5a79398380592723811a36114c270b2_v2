As the Queen Regent, she is seated on the Small Council, wielding significant influence over its decisions and operations. Despite her position of authority, Cersei harbors deep distrust toward the current members of the Small Council, likely stemming from past betrayals or perceived threats to her power. This distrust does not prevent her from engaging with the council, however, as she has urgent business to address with them. Her interactions with the Small Council are thus marked by a blend of necessity and suspicion, reflecting her calculated and often ruthless approach to governance. Cerseiâ€™s role on the council underscores her determination to maintain control over the realm, even as she navigates the treacherous dynamics of court politics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749081080, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
