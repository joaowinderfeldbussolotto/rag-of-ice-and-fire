Initially an adventurous boy who enjoyed climbing and dreamed of knighthood, his life changed dramatically when he was pushed out a window by Jaime Lannister after witnessing Cersei and Jaime’s incestuous relationship. The fall left him paralyzed from the waist down, confining him to bed and later to being carried by Hodor, his loyal servant. Despite his physical limitations, Bran developed extraordinary abilities, including prophetic dreams and the power to warg—entering the minds of animals, particularly his direwolf, Summer.\n\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt by a Valyrian dagger, Bran became a target of the Lannisters, who sought to silence him. He fled Winterfell with companions, including Meera and Jojen Reed, who guided him on a journey north to find the Three-Eyed Crow, a mysterious figure who could teach him to harness his abilities. Along the way, Bran learned to use weirwood trees to glimpse the past, present, and future, and he was eventually brought to a cave by Coldhands, a enigmatic figure tied to the Children of the Forest.\n\nBran’s story is one of resilience and transformation. Though believed dead by many, including Theon Greyjoy, who failed to find him during his search for the missing Stark children, Bran’s survival and growing powers made him a significant figure in the broader narrative. His dreams and visions connected him to his family, distant lands, and the deeper magic of Westeros. Despite his youth, Bran’s journey from a crippled boy to a powerful warg and greenseer marked him as a key player in the unfolding events beyond the Wall and within the political struggles of the Seven Kingdoms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749060956, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 1487, "total_tokens": 1861, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
