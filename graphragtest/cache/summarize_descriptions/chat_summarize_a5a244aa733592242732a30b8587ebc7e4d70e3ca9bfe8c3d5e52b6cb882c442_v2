Since childhood, they have been lovers, a bond that defies societal norms and has drawn significant scrutiny. Their relationship is further complicated by their involvement in morally questionable acts, including their role in the attempted murder of Bran Stark, which Cersei openly admits to.\n\nJaime, as Cersei’s brother and lover, also serves as a key military leader, fighting to protect her interests and defend her against enemies. Their connection is marked by both loyalty and controversy, as their actions often blur the lines between family devotion and personal ambition. Together, they navigate the treacherous political landscape of their world, with Jaime’s military prowess and Cersei’s cunning intellect forming a formidable alliance.
