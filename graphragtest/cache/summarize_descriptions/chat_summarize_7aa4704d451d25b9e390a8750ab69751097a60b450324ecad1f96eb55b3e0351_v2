Originally a stableboy at Winterfell, he serves as Bran’s devoted companion and caretaker, often carrying him in a basket on his back or to his bed. Despite his limited vocabulary—repeatedly uttering only the word \"Hodor\"—his strength and dedication make him indispensable to Bran.\n\nHodor accompanies Bran on his journeys, including their escape with Rickon Stark and their quest north in search of the Three-Eyed Crow. Though he dislikes being skinchanged by Bran, who can control his body through magical abilities, Hodor remains protective of him, even calming under Bran’s influence. His size, while impressive, is noted to be smaller than that of Ser Gregor Clegane, emphasizing his formidable yet gentle nature.\n\nHodor’s role extends beyond physical assistance; he also defends Bran, chasing away threats like wolves and enduring insults from others, such as the Walders. Despite his reluctance at times, such as when taking Bran to the crypts, his commitment to Bran’s safety and well-being never wavers. Hodor’s character is defined by his simplicity, strength, and deep bond with Bran, making him a beloved and integral figure in the Stark household.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075189, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 562, "total_tokens": 835, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
