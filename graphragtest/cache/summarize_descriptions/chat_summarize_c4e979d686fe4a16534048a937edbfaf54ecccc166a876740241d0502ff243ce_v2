Tasked with enforcing discipline, he is known for his harsh treatment of those under his authority, particularly Arya Stark, whom he physically abuses and beats for disobedience. Despite his role in delivering messages and maintaining order, Weese is deeply despised by Arya, who views him as a brutal enforcer. He works under Lord Tywin Lannister and is adept at detecting defiance, using his position to instill fear and compliance. Weeseâ€™s cruelty extends beyond mere oversight; he shares food with Arya only to later subject her to further mistreatment. His fate is grim, as his body is eventually found with a dog tearing at his flesh, marking a violent end to his tyrannical presence. Throughout his time at Harrenhal, Weese remains a symbol of oppression, embodying the brutality of the regime under which Arya suffers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749071480, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 531, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
