Renowned for their extreme violence, including rape and other atrocities, they are a feared force in the lands they operate. Key members of the group include Shagwell, Urswyck, and Rorge, all of whom are known for their ruthless and brutal fighting tactics.\n\nThe Bloody Mummers play a significant role in the events at Harrenhal, where they capture northmen and bring them to the fortress. Their actions extend beyond Harrenhal, as they are also known to have held a septry, though they were eventually defeated by the Brotherhood Without Banners. Additionally, they are infamous for their cruel treatment of captives, as demonstrated when they paraded Ser Amory Lorch and fed him to a bear.\n\nJaime Lannister, during his captivity, specifically requests to be sent to the Bloody Mummers if captured, indicating their reputation and involvement in the conflicts of the time. The group’s brutality is further highlighted by their attempted assault on Brienne of Tarth, reinforcing their notoriety for violence and lawlessness. Under Vargo Hoat’s leadership, the Bloody Mummers remain one of the most feared and reviled mercenary bands in the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076447, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 276, "prompt_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
