After leaving his service to House Lannister, Sandor Clegane joins Beric Dondarrion's band of outlaws, known as the Brotherhood Without Banners. This group operates beyond the reach of the law, often targeting those they deem corrupt or unjust.\n\nDuring his time with the Brotherhood, Sandor Clegane faces judgment from Beric Dondarrion in a trial by combat. This trial is a test of his character and past actions, particularly his role in the atrocities committed under the Lannister banner. The confrontation is intense, as both men are skilled fighters, but it ultimately serves as a pivotal moment in Sandor’s journey, forcing him to reflect on his past and the path he wishes to follow. The outcome of the trial and its implications for Sandor’s future remain significant, marking a turning point in his life.\n\nBeric Dondarrion, as the leader of the Brotherhood, is known for his unwavering sense of justice and his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers. His encounter with Sandor Clegane highlights his role as both a judge and a leader, willing to confront even the most dangerous individuals to uphold his principles.
