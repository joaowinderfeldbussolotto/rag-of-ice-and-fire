Jon, a key figure in the Night's Watch, engages in multiple discussions with Stannis Baratheon about Mance Rayder’s honor, highlighting a deep connection or underlying tension between them. Their interactions intensify after Mance Rayder’s true identity is revealed, suggesting a history or shared understanding that influences their dynamic.\n\nAt one point, Jon is brought before Mance Rayder, who subjects him to a test of loyalty, underscoring the distrust or caution between them. Jon’s concern for Mance Rayder’s whereabouts further emphasizes the significance of their relationship, as he is later sent as an envoy to meet with him, indicating a diplomatic or strategic role in their interactions.\n\nThe relationship takes a grim turn when Jon learns from Ramsay Bolton’s letter that Mance Rayder has been captured and subjected to flaying, a brutal fate that marks a tragic end to their complex connection. This revelation underscores the perilous and often violent world they inhabit, where honor and survival frequently clash.
