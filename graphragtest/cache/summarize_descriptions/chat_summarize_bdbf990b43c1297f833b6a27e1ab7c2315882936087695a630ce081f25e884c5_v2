Upon Catelyn's arrival at the Gatehouse Tower, they demonstrate their respect and allegiance by paying their respects to her, underscoring their adherence to noble customs and hierarchies. Despite their noble standing, The Lords are depicted as pragmatic and strategic, as they choose submission over destruction when faced with dire circumstances. This decision highlights their preference for preservation and stability, even if it means yielding to greater powers. Their actions reflect a balance between maintaining their noble dignity and making calculated choices to ensure their survival and the well-being of their people.
