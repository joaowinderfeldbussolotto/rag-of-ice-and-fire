Captured by Robb Stark, he was held as a prisoner and later mentioned in the peace terms between Robb Stark and the Lannisters. His captivity made him a key figure in negotiations, with proposals for his exchange as part of broader diplomatic efforts. However, his fate took a dark turn when he was murdered by Rickard Karstark, a vengeful northern lord seeking retribution for the deaths of his sons at the hands of the Lannisters. This act of violence not only ended Willem’s life but also strained relations between Robb Stark and his bannermen, as Karstark’s actions defied Stark’s authority. Willem Lannister’s role, though brief, highlights the brutal and unpredictable nature of the conflict, as well as the personal vendettas that often overshadowed political strategy. His death underscored the fragility of alliances and the high stakes of the war.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076147, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
