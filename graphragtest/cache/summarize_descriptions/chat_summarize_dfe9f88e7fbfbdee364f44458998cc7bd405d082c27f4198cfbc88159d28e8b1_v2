Known for their covert and violent tactics, they have been responsible for a series of killings and acts of sabotage, including the poisoning of locusts, as part of their resistance against her governance. Barristan Selmy, a trusted advisor to Daenerys, suspects that Hizdahr zo Loraq, a prominent Meereenese noble, may be in league with the group, though this allegation remains unconfirmed. The Sons of the Harpy represent a persistent and dangerous threat to Daenerys's authority, embodying the deep-seated resistance among certain factions of Meereen's population to her reforms and leadership.
