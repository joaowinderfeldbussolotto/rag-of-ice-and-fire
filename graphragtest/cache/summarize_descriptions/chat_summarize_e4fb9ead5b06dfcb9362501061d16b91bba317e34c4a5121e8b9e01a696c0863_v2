As a key figure in her father’s long-term plans, she is deeply involved in the intricate schemes of Dorne, often acting with ambition and determination. Arianne is particularly close to Daemon Sand and Sylva Santagar, who are among her trusted companions.\n\nArianne is known for her bold and sometimes reckless actions, most notably her attempt to crown Myrcella Baratheon as the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, a move intended to secure Dorne’s influence and assert Myrcella’s right to rule. In pursuit of this goal, she persuades Ser Arys Oakheart, a knight of the Kingsguard, to defend Myrcella’s birthright and support her claim. However, her scheme ultimately fails, leading to her imprisonment by her father, Prince Doran, who disapproves of her methods but still values her as part of his broader strategy.\n\nDespite her setbacks, Arianne remains a formidable and cunning leader, driven by her desire to secure Dorne’s future and honor. Her interactions with Ser Arys Oakheart are marked by both persuasion and seduction, as she seeks to rally support for her cause. Though her actions sometimes clash with her father’s more cautious approach, she remains a central figure in Dorne’s political landscape, embodying the fiery and independent spirit of her people.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749077852, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 313, "prompt_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 635, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
