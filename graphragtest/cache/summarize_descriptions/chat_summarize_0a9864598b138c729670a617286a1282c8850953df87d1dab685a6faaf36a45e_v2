His successful capture of the castle demonstrates his military prowess and the trust placed in him by his superiors. During his occupation, Roose Bolton exercises control over Harrenhal, reinforcing his authority and influence in the region. However, his eventual departure from Harrenhal suggests a shift in his strategic priorities or a reallocation of his forces, though his association with the location remains notable. Harrenhal, known for its imposing structure and dark history, serves as a key stronghold under Boltonâ€™s command, further solidifying his role as a key player in the political and military landscape of Westeros.
