As a member of House Reed and Meera Reed’s brother, Jojen possesses the rare gift of greensight, allowing him to foresee future events through vivid green dreams. His visions often come true, particularly during pivotal moments such as the fall of Winterfell, though his abilities are initially dismissed by figures like Maester Luwin.\n\nJojen serves as a companion and advisor to Bran Stark, guiding him through the challenges of his burgeoning powers as a greenseer. He warns Bran about the dangers of his abilities, particularly the risks of spending too much time inhabiting the body of his direwolf, Summer. Jojen’s counsel is crucial in Bran’s journey, as he informs Sam about Bran’s significance to Coldhands and accompanies Bran on his quest north in search of the mysterious three-eyed crow.\n\nDespite his wisdom, Jojen is physically frail, suffering from illness and weakness exacerbated by hunger and the harsh cold. His condition worsens over time, marked by fits of shaking and a growing solemnity. Nevertheless, his presence in the godswood of Winterfell and his unwavering belief in his visions solidify his role as a key figure in Bran’s story. Jojen’s prophetic dreams and his guidance shape Bran’s path, making him an indispensable ally in the unfolding events beyond the Wall.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749071636, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 392, "total_tokens": 695, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
