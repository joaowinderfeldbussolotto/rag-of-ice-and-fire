As one of Theon's guards, WEX plays a notable role in his service, often alerting Theon to important details, such as the absence of human tracks. His muteness does not hinder his ability to communicate effectively through gestures and expressions, which sometimes provoke strong reactions. For instance, WEX once smirked at Theon after Asha Greyjoy's revelation, an action that angered Theon. Despite his lack of speech, WEX remains a significant figure in Theon's entourage, contributing to critical moments through his observations and presence. His resilience and keen awareness make him a valuable, if sometimes provocative, companion to Theon.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749071336, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
