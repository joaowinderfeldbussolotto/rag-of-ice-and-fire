Recognizable by their distinctive golden cloaks, they serve as the primary guard force within the capital, responsible for patrolling the streets, guarding the city's walls and gates, and executing the will of the crown.\n\nUnder the command of figures such as Janos Slynt and formerly Ser Osfryd, the Gold Cloaks are often depicted as corrupt, ineffective, or overly brutal, reflecting the political turmoil of King's Landing. They play a significant role in key events, such as attempting to arrest Barristan Selmy and the Bull, though they sometimes retreat when faced with overwhelming opposition. During the Battle of the Blackwater, they are noted for celebrating prematurely, highlighting their occasional ineptitude.\n\nThe Gold Cloaks are also involved in high-profile missions, such as searching for Arya Stark and her companions, including the Bull, at the behest of Queen Cersei. They are seen as a threat by those opposing the Lannisters, including Arya, who actively avoids them. Additionally, they are responsible for escorting prisoners, such as Tyrion Lannister, to the black cells following significant events like Oberyn Martell's defeat.\n\nAs a military force, they are armed with spears and outnumber the Lannister household troops, reinforcing their role as the primary enforcers of the crown's authority. Despite their official duties, their reputation is marred by corruption and inconsistency, making them a feared yet unreliable presence in the city.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065576, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 526, "total_tokens": 869, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
