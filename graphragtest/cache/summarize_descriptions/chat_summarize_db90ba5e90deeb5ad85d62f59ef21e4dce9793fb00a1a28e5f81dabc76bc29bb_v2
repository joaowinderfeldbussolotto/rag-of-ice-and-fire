He is the brother of Cleos Frey and was captured by Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings. Tion Frey became a significant figure in the exchange negotiations between House Stark and House Frey, as his captivity was mentioned in the peace terms. However, his life was cut short when he was murdered by Rickard Karstark, a Stark bannerman, in an act of vengeance. This event further escalated tensions between the warring factions. Tion Frey's role, though brief, underscores the brutal and unpredictable nature of the conflict, as well as the personal vendettas that fueled the war. His death also highlights the fragility of diplomatic efforts during this tumultuous period.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749069164, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 382, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
