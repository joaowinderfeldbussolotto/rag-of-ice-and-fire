Initially serving under King Aerys II Targaryen, he was later dismissed by King Joffrey Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, accused of treason, and forced to flee King’s Landing. Despite his dishonor in the eyes of the new regime, he remained a symbol of knightly virtue, respected for his unwavering dedication to those he served.\n\nAfter escaping, Barristan traveled to Meereen, where he pledged his sword to Daenerys Targaryen, becoming a key advisor and protector in her court. As Lord Commander of her Queensguard, he provided counsel on political, military, and security matters, often expressing concern for her safety and disapproval of certain decisions, such as her potential marriage alliances. His loyalty to Daenerys was steadfast, though he occasionally clashed with her on matters of strategy and morality.\n\nBarristan’s reputation was built on his legendary deeds, including slaying Maelys Blackfyre and his defeat by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen at the Tourney at Harrenhal. He was also referenced in conversations about King Aerys’ reign and feared by figures like Tyrion Lannister, who believed he might prejudice Daenerys against him. Despite his age, he remained a formidable warrior and a trusted advisor, praised for his wisdom and integrity.\n\nIn Meereen, he served as the Queen’s Hand, overseeing governance and defending her interests against political maneuvers. His suspicions of others, particularly regarding the Windblown and other factions, underscored his vigilance. Though he was a man of honor, his past—marked by both glory and disgrace—shaped his cautious approach to Daenerys’ rule. Ultimately, Barristan Selmy stood as a paragon of knighthood, a man whose life was defined by service, sacrifice, and an unyielding commitment to justice.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749061964, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 434, "prompt_tokens": 671, "total_tokens": 1105, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
