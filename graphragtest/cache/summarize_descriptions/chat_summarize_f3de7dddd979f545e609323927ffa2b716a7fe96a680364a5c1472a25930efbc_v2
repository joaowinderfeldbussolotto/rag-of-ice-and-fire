As a captive, his situation suggests he may be a pawn in a larger political or familial conflict, given his lineage and the circumstances of his imprisonment. The details surrounding his capture and the reasons for his confinement remain unspecified, but his status as the son of a lord implies he holds some significance, whether as leverage or as a figure of contention. The Twins, where he is detained, could be a strategic location, further hinting at the broader implications of his captivity.
