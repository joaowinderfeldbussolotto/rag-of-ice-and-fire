Their lineage is steeped in history, with their legacy preserved through the statues in the crypts beneath Winterfell, where each ruler is represented. As the sovereigns of the North, they governed with authority until their crown was lost to Aegon the Conqueror during his conquest of Westeros. Despite the end of their direct rule, the Kings of Winter remain a symbol of the North's independence and resilience, their memory honored by the Stark family and the people of the North.
