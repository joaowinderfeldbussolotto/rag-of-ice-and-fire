It was famously used by Lysa Arryn to kill her husband, Jon Arryn, under the manipulation of Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish. This act set in motion a chain of events that contributed to the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings. The poison is also associated with the training of Arya Stark, as it was one of the poisons taught to her by the Waif during her time with the Faceless Men in Braavos. Additionally, Varys once suggested using Tears of Lys as a means to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen, highlighting its potency and the fear it instills among those in power. Known for its lethal efficiency, Tears of Lys remains one of the most infamous poisons in the realm, often linked to covert assassinations and high-profile murders.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063752, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
