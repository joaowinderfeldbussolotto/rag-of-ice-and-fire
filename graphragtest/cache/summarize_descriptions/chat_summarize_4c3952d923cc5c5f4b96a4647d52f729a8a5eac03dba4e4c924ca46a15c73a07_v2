This interaction underscores her deep bond with the creatures, which are integral to her identity and power. Rhaegal, named after Daenerys' late brother Rhaegar Targaryen, is one of her dragons, currently chained within a pit. Despite being restrained, Rhaegal remains a formidable and symbolic presence, reflecting Daenerys' complex relationship with her dragonsâ€”both as protectors and as forces that require control. The chaining of Rhaegal highlights the challenges Daenerys faces in managing her dragons' wild nature while maintaining her authority.
