Lysa, the elder sister, has played a pivotal role in shaping Catelyn's decisions, particularly in the capture of Tyrion Lannister. Despite their familial bond, their actions have sometimes been at odds. Notably, Lysa later facilitated Tyrion Lannister's escape, a move that contrasted with her earlier influence on Catelyn's actions against him. This dynamic underscores the complex and often strained nature of their sisterly relationship, marked by both loyalty and conflict.
