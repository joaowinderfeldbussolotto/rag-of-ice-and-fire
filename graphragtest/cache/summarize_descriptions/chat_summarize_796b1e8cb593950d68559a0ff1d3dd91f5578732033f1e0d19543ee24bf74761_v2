He is the uncle of Greatjon Umber and earned his nickname after losing an eye to a crow. Mors is a key figure in the political landscape of the North, known for his support of Stannis Baratheon, though his allegiance comes with conditions. He attended a significant feast, where he was present among other noblemen and was notably seen dancing with a serving girl, showcasing a lighter side to his otherwise stern demeanor. Mors Umberâ€™s role in the North is marked by his strategic alliances, particularly his conditional offer of support to Stannis, reflecting his pragmatic approach to leadership and loyalty.
