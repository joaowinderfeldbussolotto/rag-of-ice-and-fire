Known for his fierce loyalty to Robb Stark and his adherence to the old gods, he initially served as a key supporter in Robb’s campaign during the War of the Five Kings, participating in the council at Riverrun. However, his story is marked by tragedy and vengeance.\n\nRickard Karstark’s sons were killed by Jaime Lannister, an act that plunged him into deep grief and rage. Consumed by his desire for retribution, he defied Robb Stark’s authority by murdering two Lannister prisoners, Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, in cold blood. This act of vengeance led to a severe conflict with Catelyn Stark, who opposed his actions, and ultimately resulted in his execution by Robb Stark for betraying his commands and killing prisoners. His death made it impossible for Vargo Hoat to return Jaime Lannister to him, further complicating the war’s dynamics.\n\nDespite his loyalty to the Starks, Rickard Karstark’s unchecked temper and thirst for revenge led to his downfall, illustrating the destructive consequences of personal vendettas in the midst of war. His legacy remains one of tragedy, as his actions not only cost him his life but also weakened the northern cause.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065900, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 283, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 668, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
