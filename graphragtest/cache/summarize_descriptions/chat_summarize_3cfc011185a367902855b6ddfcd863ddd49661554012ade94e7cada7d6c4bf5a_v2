Bran is sent to King's Landing to bridge the gap between his brother Robb Stark and King Joffrey Baratheon. However, Bran is also known for witnessing a secret encounter between Queen Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister, a discovery that leads to an attempt on his life. This incident prompts Ned Stark to investigate Bran's fall and its potential connection to the death of Jon Arryn, the former Hand of the King. Throughout these events, Ned expresses a deep longing to be with Bran in Winterfell, reflecting his protective and caring nature as a father.
