Theon Greyjoy, a ward of House Stark and close companion to Robb, was a key figure in his early campaigns. Theon advised Robb to call the banners of the North, rallying the northern lords to his cause, which marked the beginning of Robb’s military efforts to secure independence for the North. Theon’s counsel proved instrumental in mobilizing support for Robb’s campaign.\n\nDuring the war, Theon fought alongside Robb, contributing to several victories. However, his loyalty was later tested when he betrayed the Starks by seizing Winterfell. Despite this betrayal, Theon had previously demonstrated his allegiance to the Stark family, notably by saving Bran Stark from an assassination attempt by a wildling. This act highlighted Theon’s complex relationship with the Starks, torn between his upbringing in Winterfell and his blood ties to House Greyjoy.\n\nRobb’s leadership and Theon’s initial support were crucial in the early stages of the war, but their paths diverged as Theon’s ambitions and familial obligations led him to turn against the Starks. Theon’s actions ultimately had significant consequences for both houses, underscoring the intricate and often conflicted dynamics of loyalty and duty in the world of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749080474, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 287, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 460, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
