It plays a central role in political decision-making, including discussions on critical matters such as Stannis Baratheon’s proclamation. The council is also a focal point of power struggles, notably where Cersei Lannister actively opposes the influence of House Tyrell, reflecting the broader tensions within the realm’s leadership.\n\nHistorically, the Small Council has been a target of espionage, with individuals like Jorah Mormont having spied for it, highlighting its significance in the political landscape. Membership in the council is highly influential but not permanent; for instance, Qyburn was once part of the council before being removed, demonstrating the fluid and often contentious nature of its composition.\n\nAs the ruling body advising the king, the Small Council wields considerable authority, shaping policies and strategies that govern the Seven Kingdoms. Its decisions and internal dynamics frequently reflect the broader conflicts and alliances within Westeros, making it a pivotal institution in the realm’s governance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749070088, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 443, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
