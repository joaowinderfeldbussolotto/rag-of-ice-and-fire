Comprising seven individuals, they were once ransomed by Tycho Nestoris from Sybelle Locke, suggesting a history of captivity or conflict before their rise to power. Their reputation for aggression and dominance has made them a significant threat, prompting figures like Bran and his companions to actively avoid encounters with them. The Ironmenâ€™s influence extends beyond mere piracy, as they exert authority over local settlements, further solidifying their status as a dangerous and organized faction in the area.
