These trees are notable for their carved faces, which were created by the greenseers and revered by the Children of the Forest. Historically, they were central to the spiritual practices of the First Men and the Children, serving as focal points for rituals and communion with nature.\n\nMany Weirwoods were once found in the haunted forest and other sacred groves, but their numbers have dwindled over time. A notable example is the grove at High Heart, where most of the Weirwoods were chopped down by the Andals during their invasion of Westeros. Despite this destruction, some Weirwoods have survived, often in remote or protected locations, continuing to hold deep symbolic meaning for those who follow the old gods. Their presence is often associated with mystery and reverence, embodying the enduring connection between the natural and spiritual worlds.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065612, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
