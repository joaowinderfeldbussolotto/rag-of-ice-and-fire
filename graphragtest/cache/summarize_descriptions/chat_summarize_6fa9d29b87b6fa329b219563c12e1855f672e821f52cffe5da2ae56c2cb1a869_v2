Septas are responsible for overseeing the moral and spiritual education of noble girls, ensuring they adhere to the teachings and values of the faith. One notable example is Septa Mordane, who served as a mentor and guardian to noble girls, including Sansa Stark, in the royal court.\n\nIn addition to their educational and supervisory roles, septas may also accompany high-ranking individuals, such as royalty, on their journeys. For instance, a septa is depicted accompanying Princess Myrcella Baratheon, demonstrating their role in providing spiritual guidance and protection. In one notable scene, a septa instructs guards to bring Arya Stark to her, highlighting their authority and involvement in the affairs of noble households.\n\nThe title \"Septa\" signifies a position of respect and responsibility within the religious hierarchy, blending pastoral care with the enforcement of doctrinal principles. Septas are often portrayed as stern yet devoted figures, deeply committed to their faith and the well-being of those under their charge. Their presence in noble courts underscores the intertwining of religion and politics in the world of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063992, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 255, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 441, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
