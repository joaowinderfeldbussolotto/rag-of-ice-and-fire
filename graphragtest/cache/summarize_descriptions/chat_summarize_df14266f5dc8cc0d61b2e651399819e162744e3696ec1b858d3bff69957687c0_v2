Comprising key officials and advisors, it plays a crucial role in overseeing the governance, political, and military affairs of the realm. The council is convened to discuss pressing matters of state, including war progress, peace negotiations, and internal conflicts, such as Robb Stark’s peace terms and Renly Baratheon’s murder. It also handles new appointments and policy decisions, making it a central institution in the administration of the kingdom.\n\nThe Small Council has been a significant force in the political chaos of Westeros, often reflecting the power struggles within the court. It has been summoned by figures like Ned Stark, who sought to confirm his role as Protector of the Realm, and has been influenced by powerful members such as Queen Cersei Lannister, Littlefinger, and Jaime Lannister. The council’s decisions have at times aligned with King Robert Baratheon’s interests, even against opposing figures like Ned Stark.\n\nAs the chief advisory body to the Iron Throne, the Small Council’s actions and deliberations shape the fate of the Seven Kingdoms, making it a pivotal entity in the realm’s governance and stability. Its meetings are critical in addressing both immediate crises and long-term strategies, ensuring the king’s rule is upheld through collective counsel.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075106, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 546, "total_tokens": 825, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
