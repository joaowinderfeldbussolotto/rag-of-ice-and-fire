Their relationship is marked by familial bonds and shared experiences, particularly within the ancestral home of their house. Robb, as the elder sibling, has at times taken on a protective and guiding role, as evidenced by an instance where he accompanied Arya to the crypts of Winterfell, a place of significance and memory for their family. Arya often reflects on her brother, contemplating his actions and the impact they have on their family and the broader political landscape of their world. Their connection is a blend of sibling affection and mutual respect, shaped by the challenges and responsibilities of their noble lineage.
