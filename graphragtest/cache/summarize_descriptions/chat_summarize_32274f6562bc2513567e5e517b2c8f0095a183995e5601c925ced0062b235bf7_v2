These trees are often found in godswoods, serving as places of worship and reflection, particularly for noble houses like the Starks of Winterfell and House Blackwood. The weirwoods are notable for their carved faces, which resemble human features and are believed to hold mystical significance.\n\nIn the visions and dreams of key figures such as Jon Snow and Bran Stark, the weirwoods play a prominent role. Jon experiences visions where a weirwood with a face resembling his brother speaks to him, while Bran is drawn to these trees in his dreams, hearing their calls. The weirwood in the godswood of Winterfell is particularly significant, as it is a place where whispers are heard, as experienced by Theon Greyjoy.\n\nThe weirwoods are also tied to the wildlings and the Night’s Watch, with a notable tree in Whitetree holding importance in their lore. These trees are sometimes targeted by wildlings, who burn them, reflecting their complex relationship with the old gods. Additionally, weirwoods are associated with supernatural events, such as ravens emerging from them to attack wights, further emphasizing their mystical nature.\n\nSacred to the old gods and linked to greenseers, the weirwoods are more than mere trees—they are symbols of ancient magic, memory, and the enduring connection between the living and the divine in the world of the First Men. Their presence in godswoods and their role in visions and dreams underscore their central place in the spiritual and cultural heritage of those who revere the old gods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065528, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 401, "total_tokens": 755, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
