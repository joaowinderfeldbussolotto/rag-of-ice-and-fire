At one point, Arya found herself surviving on the streets of King’s Landing, navigating its dangers and harsh conditions. This period of her life was marked by hardship, as she had to rely on her wits and resourcefulness to endure. Additionally, Arya passed through King’s Landing while traveling with Yoren, a member of the Night’s Watch, who was escorting a group of recruits north to the Wall. This journey was part of her broader travels across Westeros, as she sought to evade those who wished her harm. Her experiences in King’s Landing, whether brief or extended, played a significant role in shaping her resilience and adaptability.
