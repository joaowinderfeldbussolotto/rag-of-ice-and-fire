They are known for their fierce loyalty and military prowess, often playing a crucial role in the political and martial affairs of the realm. During the War of the Five Kings, a significant faction of the Storm Lords declared their support for Renly Baratheon, raising their standards in his name and bolstering his claim to the Iron Throne. This allegiance highlighted their influence and willingness to engage in the broader conflicts of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nHowever, the Storm Lords are also noted for their dismissive attitude toward authority and counsel, particularly in their interactions with Stannis Baratheon. They are described as having laughed at the advice of Maester Cressen, a trusted advisor to Stannis, demonstrating a lack of respect for his guidance. Stannis himself cited their behavior as an example of the broader disdain his advisors faced, underscoring the Storm Lords' independent and sometimes rebellious nature.\n\nDespite their defiance, the Storm Lords remain a formidable and respected group within Westeros, known for their strength in battle and their unwavering commitment to their chosen causes. Their actions during the War of the Five Kings and their interactions with key figures like Renly and Stannis illustrate their complex role in the political landscape of the realm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076207, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 270, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 467, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
