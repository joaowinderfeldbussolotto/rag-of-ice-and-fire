With this new title, Slynt intended to claim Harrenhal as his seat, solidifying his position and influence. The grant of lordship over Harrenhal marked a significant elevation in his status, as the castle was not only a strategic stronghold but also a symbol of power and prestige. Slynt's acquisition of Harrenhal reflected his political maneuvering and the favor he held with those in authority. However, his tenure as Lord of Harrenhal was short-lived, as his ambitions and actions eventually led to his downfall.
