As a member of the royal family, she holds a significant position in the political and social hierarchy of the realm. During her travels or interactions, she encounters Arya Stark, whom she mistakenly identifies as a boy, likely due to Arya's tomboyish appearance or attire. This brief but notable interaction highlights Myrcella's sheltered upbringing and the formalities of her royal status, as well as her limited exposure to the broader world beyond the court.
