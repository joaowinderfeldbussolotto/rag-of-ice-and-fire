He served under King Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King, during the latter's reign. Rossart played a significant role in Aerys' wildfire plot, which aimed to annihilate the capital city of King's Landing using caches of wildfire strategically placed throughout the city. His involvement in this scheme marked him as a key figure in the Mad King's desperate and destructive plans during the final days of his rule. Ultimately, Rossart was killed by Jaime Lannister, who took this drastic action to thwart the wildfire plot and prevent the catastrophic destruction of King's Landing.
