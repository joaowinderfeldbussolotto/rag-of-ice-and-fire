As the eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark, Sansa was sent to Winterfell by her father for safety, reflecting the castle's significance as a sanctuary for the Stark family. Despite being away, her bond with Winterfell remains strong, as evidenced by her crafting a detailed snow replica of the castle, showcasing her affection and longing for her home.\n\nWinterfell, the seat of House Stark, holds immense personal and historical importance for Sansa. It is not only the place of her upbringing but also a symbol of her family's legacy and resilience. Throughout her journey, Sansa expresses a persistent desire to return to Winterfell, driven by her sense of belonging and duty to her ancestral home. Her longing underscores Winterfell's role as more than just a fortress; it is a place of identity, strength, and heritage for Sansa.\n\nThe relationship between Sansa and Winterfell is one of mutual significance. For Sansa, Winterfell represents safety, family, and the values instilled in her as a Stark. Conversely, her eventual return to Winterfell would symbolize the restoration of her family's rule and the fulfillment of her personal journey.
