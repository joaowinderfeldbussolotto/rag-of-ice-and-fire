Serving under the Lannister regime, they are responsible for guarding the city’s walls and gates, as well as upholding the authority of Queen Cersei and her family. The Gold Cloaks are armed with spears and are known to outnumber the Lannister forces within the capital, making them a significant but often corrupt or ineffective force.\n\nLed at various times by figures such as Janos Slynt and Ser Osfryd, the Gold Cloaks play a pivotal role in key events, including the arrest of Tyrion Lannister, whom they take to the black cells following Oberyn Martell’s defeat. They are also involved in the search for Arya Stark and her companion, the Bull, though their attempts to arrest them are sometimes thwarted, as seen when Yoren threatens them into retreat. During the Battle of the Blackwater, the Gold Cloaks are noted for celebrating prematurely, reflecting their occasional ineptitude.\n\nDespite their official duties, the Gold Cloaks are often perceived as a group to be avoided, given their association with the oppressive Lannister rule and their reputation for corruption. Their presence is notable at public events, such as tourneys, where they maintain a visible but not always reliable authority. Ultimately, the Gold Cloaks represent the flawed enforcement arm of King’s Landing, balancing between their role as protectors of the throne and their often questionable effectiveness.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749075637, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 465, "total_tokens": 800, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
