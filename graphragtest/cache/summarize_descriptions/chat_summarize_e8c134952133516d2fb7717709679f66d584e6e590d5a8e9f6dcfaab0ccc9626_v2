Originally a lord of House Florent and the former Lord of Brightwater Keep, he was once aligned with House Tyrell. However, he is best known for his dramatic shift in allegiance, abandoning his ties to the Tyrells and switching his loyalty to Stannis Baratheon, a move that branded him a traitor to his former allies.\n\nAs a key supporter of Stannis, Alester Florent rose to prominence in his new lord’s service, eventually being appointed as Stannis' Hand, a position of significant authority and influence. Despite this high-ranking role, his tenure was marked by turmoil and betrayal. Alester Florent’s loyalty to Stannis was ultimately undermined by his own actions, as he was revealed to have plotted against Stannis, seeking to betray him. This treachery led to his downfall, leaving him a defeated and disgraced man.\n\nAlester Florent’s story is one of shifting loyalties and political maneuvering. He not only changed his allegiance from House Tyrell to Stannis Baratheon but also abandoned his family’s traditional faith, adopting the worship of the Lord of Light, the god favored by Stannis and his followers. This religious conversion further underscored his break from his past and his commitment to Stannis’ cause—at least until his own ambitions led him to betrayal.\n\nIn summary, Alester Florent is a figure defined by his changing allegiances, his rise and fall within Stannis Baratheon’s service, and his ultimate failure as both a loyalist and a conspirator. His actions left a lasting mark on the political and military struggles of his time, illustrating the perilous nature of power and betrayal in Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749076501, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 360, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 571, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
