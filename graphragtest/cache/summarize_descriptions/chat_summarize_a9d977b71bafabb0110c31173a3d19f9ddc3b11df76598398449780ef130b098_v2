He is one of the Walders, described as tall and stout, and is present at Winterfell as a ward alongside other children. During his time at Winterfell, he is bitten by Shaggydog, one of the Stark direwolves, and is known for his mean-spirited behavior, which earns him mockery from Osha. Bran Stark dislikes him and wishes he were not among his companions, as Little Walder insults both Bran and Hodor.\n\nLittle Walder is also present at a feast where he interacts with Rickon Stark and engages in games with the other children. His involvement in discussions about the line of succession following Stevron Frey’s death highlights his awareness of House Frey’s political dynamics. Additionally, he is one of the Frey boys who interact with Reek at the Dreadfort, further emphasizing his connections within his family’s affairs.\n\nHis death becomes a significant event, as it sparks a conflict between House Frey and House Manderly, serving as a catalyst for the subsequent fight in Winterfell. Despite his youth, Little Walder’s actions and fate play a notable role in the tensions between the great houses of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749068792, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 358, "total_tokens": 624, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
