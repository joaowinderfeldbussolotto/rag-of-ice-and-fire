Revered in certain cultures, the Great Other embodies the forces of cold and shadow, standing in direct opposition to R'hllor's warmth and life-giving essence. This deity is often associated with the harsh, unyielding nature of winter and the relentless advance of darkness, symbolizing the struggle between opposing cosmic forces. Followers of R'hllor view the Great Other as a malevolent entity, representing the ultimate adversary in their spiritual and philosophical beliefs.
