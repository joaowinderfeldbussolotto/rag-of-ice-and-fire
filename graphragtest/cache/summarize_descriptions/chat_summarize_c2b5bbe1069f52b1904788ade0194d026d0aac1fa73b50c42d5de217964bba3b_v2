A cunning and politically astute nobleman, he is known for his strategic maneuvering and disloyalty, often waiting until the outcome of conflicts is clear before committing his forces. His late arrival at the Battle of the Trident is a notable example of his cautious and self-serving nature.\n\nWalder Frey is the father of numerous children, including Stevron Frey, Elmar Frey, and Walda Frey, the latter of whom he offered in marriage to Roose Bolton. He is also the grandfather of the Walders, further emphasizing his extensive lineage. His many daughters have been used as political pawns, with some considered as potential brides for Ser Brynden, showcasing his willingness to leverage family ties for alliances.\n\nInitially allied with Robb Stark, Walder Frey broke this alliance after Robb married Jeyne Westerling, spurning a prior marriage pact. This betrayal culminated in the infamous Red Wedding, where Walder Frey orchestrated the massacre of Robb Stark, his army, and his bannermen, marking one of the most treacherous acts in political intrigue. His involvement in the death of a king further cements his reputation as a ruthless and calculating figure.\n\nWalder Frey is also noted for his negotiations with Robb and Catelyn Stark, where he demanded concessions in exchange for allowing Robbâ€™s army to cross the Green Fork. His gathering of 4,000 men underscores his military influence, though his actions are often driven by self-interest rather than loyalty. Despite his age, he remains a formidable player in the political landscape, feared and distrusted for his past disloyalty and willingness to betray even the most sacred bonds for power and advantage. His potential receipt of Harrenhal reflects his ambition and the rewards he seeks for his treachery.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063356, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 401, "prompt_tokens": 520, "total_tokens": 921, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
