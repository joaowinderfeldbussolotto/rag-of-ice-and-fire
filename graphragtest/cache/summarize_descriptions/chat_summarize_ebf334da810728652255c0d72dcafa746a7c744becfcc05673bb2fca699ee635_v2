This act of defiance marked him as a threat to Daenerys and her people, as he sought to assert his own power and challenge her authority. His actions demonstrate ambition and a willingness to break from traditional loyalties, positioning him as a dangerous adversary in the political and martial landscape of the Dothraki.
