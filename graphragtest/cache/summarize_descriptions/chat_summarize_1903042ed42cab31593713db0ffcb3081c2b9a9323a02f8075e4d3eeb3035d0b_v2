Edwyn is noted for his political acumen and his role in the complex dynamics of the Riverlands, often engaging in diplomatic and contentious interactions with rival houses.\n\nDuring key events, Edwyn was placed in charge by Jaime Lannister, a decision that underscored his perceived competence or strategic importance.

This disdain may stem from personal ambitions or disagreements over the direction of House Frey.\n\nEdwyn was also part of the welcoming party for significant guests, indicating his role in representing House Frey in formal and ceremonial capacities. His presence in such settings reinforces his status as a key figure in the family, trusted to uphold the Frey name in both political and social contexts.
