As the head of his noble house, he was the father of Catelyn and Lysa Tully, two prominent figures in the political landscape of Westeros. In his final days, Lord Hoster suffered from a prolonged illness, which he kept secret, and experienced fever dreams as his condition worsened. Despite his declining health, he maintained interactions with his daughter Catelyn and his grandson Robb Stark, reflecting his enduring influence within his family.\n\nLord Hoster’s brother, Ser Brynden Tully, also known as the Blackfish, notably escaped from Riverrun, adding to the complexities surrounding the family’s legacy. As the dying lord of House Tully, Lord Hoster’s leadership and the eventual succession of his house became matters of great importance, shaping the political dynamics of the Riverlands.
