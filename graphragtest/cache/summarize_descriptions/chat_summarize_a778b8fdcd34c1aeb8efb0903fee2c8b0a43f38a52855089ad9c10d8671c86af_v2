He accompanied Lady Catelyn Stark on her mission, demonstrating loyalty to her cause despite expressing reservations about the fight, stating that it was not theirs. However, Catelyn insisted on continuing her mission. Tragically, Ser Wendel met his end during the Red Wedding, a brutal massacre orchestrated by House Frey. He was killed by a crossbow bolt, becoming one of the many victims of the betrayal. After his death, his bones were brought back by the Freys, a grim reminder of the atrocities committed. Ser Wendel Manderly is remembered as a dutiful son of House Manderly and a loyal companion to Catelyn Stark, whose life was cut short by the treachery of their enemies. His death further fueled the animosity between House Manderly and House Frey, contributing to the broader conflicts in the North.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749066236, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 201, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
