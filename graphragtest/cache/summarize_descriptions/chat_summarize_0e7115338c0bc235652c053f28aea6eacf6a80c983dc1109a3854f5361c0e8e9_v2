Worshipped by the Northmen, the First Men, and the Starks, they are closely associated with nature, particularly the weirwood trees, which serve as sacred symbols of their faith. The Old Gods hold significant cultural and religious importance among the northern houses, including the crannogmen and other northerners, as well as the wildlings, who maintain the traditional practices tied to these deities.\n\nBeyond the Wall, the Old Gods are revered by figures such as Qhorin Halfhand, who acknowledges their strength in the harsh, untamed lands. They are also invoked by individuals like Sam in the haunted forest, who prays to them for protection, reflecting their role as guardians in perilous times. The children of the forest originally worshipped the Old Gods, and their faith was later adopted by the First Men, creating a shared spiritual heritage between these ancient peoples.\n\nThe Old Gods remain a central religious force among Robb Starkâ€™s bannermen, including prominent figures like the Greatjon and Maege Mormont, underscoring their enduring influence in the North. Their worship is characterized by a deep connection to the land, ancient traditions, and the mystical presence of the weirwoods, which are often seen as conduits to the divine. This faith stands in contrast to the newer religions of Westeros, preserving the old ways and the spiritual bond between the people and the natural world.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749059984, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 332, "total_tokens": 635, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
