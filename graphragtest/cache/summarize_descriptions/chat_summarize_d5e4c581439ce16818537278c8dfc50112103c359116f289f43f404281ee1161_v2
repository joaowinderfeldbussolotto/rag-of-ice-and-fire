Initially, he is tasked with searching the body of a decomposing soldier for valuables, a duty assigned by Yoren. Later, Dobber demonstrates vigilance by spying a fire on the northern horizon, which causes unease among the group. His keen observation skills are further highlighted when he notices something significant in the text, though the exact details remain unspecified.\n\nDuring a confrontation, Dobber proves his loyalty and bravery. He is one of the recruits who, in solidarity with Arya, drops everything but his dagger to defend against the gold cloaks. This act underscores his readiness to stand with his companions in times of danger. However, his courage ultimately leads to his demise when he wrestles an attacker but is killed during the battle.\n\nThroughout his time with Yoren's group, Dobber is depicted as a resourceful and committed individual, willing to undertake unpleasant tasks and stand his ground in defense of his allies. His actions reflect both his practical skills and his loyalty to the group, making him a notable figure in their struggles.
