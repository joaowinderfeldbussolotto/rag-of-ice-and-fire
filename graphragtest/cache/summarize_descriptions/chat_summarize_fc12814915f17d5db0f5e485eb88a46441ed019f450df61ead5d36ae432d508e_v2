He is the father of Cleos Frey, bearing the distinctive features common to the Frey lineage. Emmon is married to Genna Lannister, a union that ties him closely to the powerful House Lannister. As part of this alliance, he was granted Riverrun by the Lannisters as a reward, though his tenure over the castle has been contentious. He is noted for his complaints about the damage inflicted on Riverrun during its siege and his outrage upon learning that he is a vassal of Petyr Baelish, reflecting his dissatisfaction with the shifting power structures in the region.\n\nEmmon Frey holds a position in the line of succession within House Frey, underscoring his importance within the family. His interactions with other nobles, such as Daven Lannister, have been strained, as his actions and demeanor have tested the patience of his allies. Despite his grievances, Emmon remains a key figure in the Frey family, balancing his loyalty to House Lannister with his own ambitions and frustrations. His legacy is further cemented through his son, Ser Cleos Frey, who continues the family’s martial traditions. Emmon’s story is one of political maneuvering, familial duty, and the challenges of maintaining power in a turbulent landscape.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749069128, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
