A key figure in the organization, Mormont is deeply involved in the strategic and investigative efforts of the Night’s Watch, including the examination of mysterious bodies found beyond the Wall.\n\nMormont is notably responsible for gifting Jon Snow the ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Longclaw, a gesture that signifies his recognition of Jon’s potential and valor.
