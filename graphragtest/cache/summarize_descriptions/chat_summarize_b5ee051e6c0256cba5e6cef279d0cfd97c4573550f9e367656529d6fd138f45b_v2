Following his time at the Tower, he was later buried in the Dornish Marches, marking the end of his life. Martyn’s lineage concluded with his son, Jory Cassel, as no further descendants carried on the family name. His association with Ned Stark and his presence at the Tower of Joy suggest he played a role in the events surrounding Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, though specific details of his actions remain largely undocumented.
