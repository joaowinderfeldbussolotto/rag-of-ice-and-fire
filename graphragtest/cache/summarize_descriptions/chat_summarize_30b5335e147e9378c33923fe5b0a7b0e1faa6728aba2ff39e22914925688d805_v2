They are closely associated with Roose Bolton and played a pivotal role in the infamous Red Wedding, where they betrayed Robb Stark, leading to his downfall. This betrayal was partly motivated by Robb Stark’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which broke a prior marriage pact with the Freys, deepening tensions between them and the Northmen.\n\nThe Freys are also implicated in the sack of Winterfell and other atrocities, including the death of Wendel Manderly. Despite this, they later attempted to mend relations with House Manderly by returning Wendel’s bones and proposing marriages, though their efforts were met with distrust. Their forces were integral to the enemy army in key battles, and they were involved in the siege of Riverrun, further vexing Daven Lannister.\n\nAfter the Red Wedding, some Frey members left following Edmure Tully’s return, while others remained, maintaining an uneasy presence in the North. Their bannermen were also noted to be present in an inn, suggesting their continued influence. Additionally, the Freys were rumored to be involved in an attack on Stannis Baratheon’s encampment, reinforcing their alignment with Roose Bolton. Their actions and shifting loyalties have cemented their reputation as a cunning and often ruthless family in the political landscape of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749063488, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 721, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
