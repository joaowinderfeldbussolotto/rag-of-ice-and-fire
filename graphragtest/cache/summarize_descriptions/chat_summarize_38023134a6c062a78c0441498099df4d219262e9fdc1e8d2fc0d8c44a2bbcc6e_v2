He suffered significant losses during the Battle of the Trident, where he lost both family and fortune while fighting for the Targaryen cause. As a father, he is mentioned as the progenitor of Lyman Darry, though further details about their relationship remain sparse.\n\nRaymun is also noted for his role in describing the destruction of Wendish Town, providing a firsthand account of the devastation. His life was tragically cut short when he became a casualty of Tywin Lannister’s ambush, an event tied to the broader conflicts stemming from Winterfell. His death underscores the brutal consequences of the political and military struggles of the era, particularly for those who remained loyal to the Targaryens.
