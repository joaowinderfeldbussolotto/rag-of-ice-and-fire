He was the father of Catelyn Stark and the grandfather of Sansa Stark, making him a significant figure in both the Tully and Stark families. As a key political and military leader, Hoster played a notable role during Robert’s Rebellion, where he came to Robert Baratheon’s rescue and demonstrated his loyalty to the rebel cause. However, his actions were not without controversy, as he was also known for destroying a village that had supported the Targaryens during the conflict.\n\nIn his later years, Hoster Tully suffered from poor health, becoming too weak to fulfill his duties. His declining condition prevented him from attending important meetings, including a mission to Renly Baratheon. Despite his illness, he remained a respected figure, and his daughter Catelyn longed to be by his side during his final days rather than engaging in political negotiations. Hoster’s death marked the end of an era for House Tully, and he was remembered in visions by the Ghost of High Heart, further cementing his legacy in the realm’s history. His passing left a significant void in the leadership of House Tully and the broader political landscape of Westeros.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749065828, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 264, "prompt_tokens": 298, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
