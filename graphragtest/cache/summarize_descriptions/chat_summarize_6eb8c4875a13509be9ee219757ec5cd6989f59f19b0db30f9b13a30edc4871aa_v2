The Citadel is renowned as a place of advanced learning, attracting students from across the realms, including notable figures such as Oberyn Martell, who studied there for a time.\n\nOne of the Citadel's key responsibilities is the observation and recording of celestial and seasonal changes. It is the institution that dispatches the white raven, a significant symbol signaling the end of summer and the approach of winter. This tradition underscores the Citadel's role in maintaining and disseminating critical knowledge, ensuring that the realms are informed of important natural cycles.
