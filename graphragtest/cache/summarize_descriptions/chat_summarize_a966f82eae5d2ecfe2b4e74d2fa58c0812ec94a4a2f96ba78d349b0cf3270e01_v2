Additionally, Raff is one of the names on Arya Stark’s list of people she seeks vengeance against, highlighting his notoriety among those who have suffered at his hands.\n\nBeyond his violent tendencies, Raff the Sweetling also served as an escort for Desmond Grell and Robin Ryger, indicating his role within a military or paramilitary structure.
