Born and raised at Riverrun, the castle holds significant personal and familial importance to her, serving as her childhood home. As the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, Catelyn’s connection to Riverrun is both emotional and hereditary, reinforcing her sense of duty and belonging to the Tully legacy.\n\nRiverrun is not only a symbol of Catelyn’s past but also a place of present significance. It is where her father, Hoster Tully, is in his final days, drawing her back to his side. Catelyn firmly believes her place is with her family at Riverrun, especially during such a critical time. Her desire to be there underscores her loyalty to her roots and her commitment to her family, even as she navigates her role as a member of House Stark through marriage.\n\nThe castle itself stands as a testament to the strength and history of House Tully, and Catelyn’s attachment to it reflects her values of family, duty, and heritage. Whether in times of joy or sorrow, Riverrun remains a central pillar in Catelyn’s life, shaping her identity and guiding her actions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749079682, "model": "mistral-medium-latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 254, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 475, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
