According to ancient legends, Azor Ahai is a heroic figure destined to be reborn to combat the forces of darkness. The prophecy surrounding Azor Ahai foretells his return to wield Lightbringer, a powerful weapon, and lead the fight against the encroaching darkness that threatens the world.\n\nIn the beliefs of certain followers, particularly those of the Red Priestess Melisandre, Azor Ahai is said to have been reborn in the form of Stannis Baratheon. Melisandre interprets the prophecies as pointing to Stannis as the chosen one, destined to fulfill the role of Azor Ahai by wielding Lightbringer and defeating the darkness. This interpretation ties the legendary figure to a contemporary leader, blending myth with present-day events.\n\nThe core of the Azor Ahai legend revolves around the idea of rebirth and the eternal struggle between light and darkness. The prophecies consistently emphasize that Azor Ahai will return to wield Lightbringer, a sword of immense power, and use it to vanquish the darkness.
