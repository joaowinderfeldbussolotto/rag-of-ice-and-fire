They hold significant spiritual importance among the wildlings, who maintain the traditional worship of these deities. The Old Gods are also invoked by individuals such as Sam, who prays to them for protection while traversing the haunted forest. Their worship reflects a bond with the natural world and the preservation of ancient customs, distinguishing them from other religious practices in the region. The Old Gods embody the enduring spiritual legacy of the North and its people, serving as a source of guidance and safeguarding for those who honor them.\",3\r\n253,THE LANNISTERS,\"The Lannisters are a powerful and influential noble family in the Seven Kingdoms, renowned for their wealth, political cunning, and military strength. Based in King’s Landing, they play a central role in the conflicts and power struggles that define the realm. The family is often distrusted by other noble houses, including the Starks, with whom they share a long-standing and bitter rivalry. Sansa Stark, in particular, harbors deep distrust toward the Lannisters due to their past actions against her family.\n\nThe Lannisters are frequently mentioned in the context of pivotal events, such as the battle for King’s Landing and the release of Jaime Lannister, a prominent member of the family. Their strategic maneuvers and military prowess make them a formidable force in the ongoing conflicts within the Seven Kingdoms. Despite their power, their reputation is marred by a legacy of ruthlessness and manipulation, further fueling tensions with other noble houses. Their influence extends beyond mere political control, shaping the fate of the realm through both overt and covert means.\",3\r\n82,THE NORTH,\"The North is a vast and significant region in Westeros, renowned for its harsh, cold climate and deep-rooted traditions. It serves as the ancestral home of House Stark, whose seat of power is Winterfell, and is a stronghold of the old gods. The region is steeped in lore, known for its vengeful ghosts and a culture that values honor and loyalty.\n\nPolitically, the North plays a crucial role in the conflicts of Westeros. Robb Stark, heir to House Stark, declares himself King in the North, asserting his responsibility to protect and retake the region from its enemies. The honor of the North is a burden he carries, and its people rally behind him, gathering for pivotal events such as the harvest feast and the declaration of his kingship. Catelyn Stark is also expected to raise an army in the North to support their cause.\n\nThe North is a land of strife, facing challenges from both external and internal forces. Stannis Baratheon, among others, sees the region as vital to his plans, though his efforts there are met with difficulties. Meanwhile, Bran Stark and his companions journey toward the Wall, a formidable barrier at the northern edge of the region, while figures like Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow traverse its expanses.\n\nFamilies such as the Tallharts and Glovers call the North home, their fates intertwined with the broader struggles of the region. The North’s identity is deeply tied to its people, the northerners, who are shaped by the land’s unforgiving environment and enduring traditions.
