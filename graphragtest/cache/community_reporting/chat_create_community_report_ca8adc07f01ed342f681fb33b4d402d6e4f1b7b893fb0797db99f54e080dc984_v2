As the bastard son of Roose Bolton, he is the heir to House Bolton, though his legitimacy is often questioned due to his birth status. Ramsay is suspected of killing Domeric Bolton, Roose’s trueborn son, which raises concerns about his potential threat to any future legitimate heirs of Roose. His brutal actions and ruthless nature define his character, making him a feared figure in the story.\n\nRamsay is particularly infamous for his role in the torment of Theon Greyjoy, whom he physically and psychologically tortures, breaking him both mentally and emotionally. Despite his cruelty, Ramsay manipulates Theon, offering him false promises, such as a bath, and coercing him into aiding his schemes, including the retrieval of his virgin bride. His sadistic behavior extends beyond Theon, as he takes pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on others, solidifying his reputation as a merciless master.\n\nA significant conflict arises when Jon Snow seeks to confront Ramsay at Winterfell, highlighting his role as a primary antagonist. His actions and ambitions pose a direct threat to the stability of the North, and his confrontation with Jon Snow underscores the broader struggle for power and justice in the region. Ramsay’s character is marked by a combination of cunning, brutality, and a complete lack of remorse, making him one of the most reviled figures in the story. His legacy is one of fear and tyranny, leaving a lasting impact on those who cross his path.\",7\r\n568,ROOSE BOLTON,\"Roose Bolton is the Lord of the Dreadfort and the head of House Bolton, a powerful and cunning nobleman from the North.

He commands the main force against Tywin Lannister, with remnants of his army positioned north of Tywin’s forces. Additionally, he arrives at Moat Cailin with Frey men, further solidifying his role in the war.\n\nPolitically, Roose Bolton is a complex figure. He attends Robb Stark’s wedding and is seated next to Catelyn Stark during the feast, but he is also deeply involved in the conspiracy behind the Red Wedding, betraying the Starks and allying with the Freys and Lannisters. This betrayal leads to his elevation as the Warden of the North, consolidating his power. Despite his allegiance to Robb Stark, he is also allied with the Karstarks, showcasing his ability to navigate shifting loyalties.\n\nRoose is the father of Ramsay Bolton (formerly Ramsay Snow), whom he legitimizes, though he harbors suspicions about Ramsay’s violent tendencies, including the possible murder of his trueborn son, Domeric. He fears for the safety of any future sons, reflecting his complicated relationship with Ramsay. Roose also disowns Ramsay before legitimizing him, highlighting his pragmatic approach to power and lineage.\n\nAs the Lord of Winterfell, Roose awaits Stannis Baratheon’s forces, positioning himself as a rival to Stannis’ claim in the North. His forces pose a significant threat to Stannis’ men, and he becomes a key figure in the political and military landscape of the North. Roose’s cunning and ruthlessness make him a formidable opponent, and his actions shape the fate of the region.\n\nIn summary, Roose Bolton is a pivotal figure in the North, known for his military prowess, political maneuvering, and complex relationships with both allies and enemies. His role in the Red Wedding and his leadership of House Bolton cement his legacy as one of the most influential and feared lords in Westeros.\",42\r\n570,DREADFORT,\"The Dreadfort is the formidable castle and ancestral seat of House Bolton, located in the North. Known for its grim reputation, it serves as the stronghold of Roose Bolton, the Lord of the Dreadfort, and his infamous son, Ramsay Bolton. The fortress is deeply associated with the Boltons and their brutal atrocities, reinforcing its fearsome legacy.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, the Dreadfort became a strategic location, targeted by Stannis Baratheon for an attack. However, the Karstarks, allies of the Boltons, attempted to bait a trap for Stannis, which he ultimately avoided. The castle also played a role in the broader conflict, including the battle at Winterfell, where Bolton forces were involved.\n\nThe Dreadfort is where Ramsay Bolton, also known as the Bastard of Bolton, massed his men, consolidating his power and preparing for military campaigns. The dungeons of the Dreadfort are infamous, notably for holding captives such as Theon Greyjoy, who was tortured and broken into the identity of \"\"Reek.\"\" Additionally, the false Arya Stark, later revealed to be Jeyne Poole, was brought to the Dreadfort to be presented as part of Ramsay’s schemes.\n\nThe castle also housed other notable figures, including Little Walder and Big Walder Frey, who were sent there as wards. Furthermore, the Dreadfort is linked to the men protecting Jaime Lannister, suggesting its involvement in broader political and military alliances.\n\nAs the seat of House Bolton, the Dreadfort stands as a symbol of the family’s ruthless dominance in the North, embodying both their power and their cruelty. Its dark history and strategic importance make it a key location in the conflicts of Westeros.\",6\r\n1374,WALDER,\"Walder is the Lord of the Twins, a prominent figure known for his stern and unyielding nature.

As Roose Bolton's legitimate heir, Domeric's passing paved the way for Ramsay Bolton to rise in prominence, though under controversial circumstances. Roose Bolton harbored suspicions that Ramsay was responsible for Domeric's death, a belief that cast a shadow over Ramsay's legitimacy and standing within the family. Additionally, Lady Barbrey Dustin held Ramsay accountable for Domeric's demise, further fueling tensions and distrust toward Ramsay. Domeric's death thus became a pivotal and contentious event in the history of House Bolton, shaping the dynamics of power and inheritance within the family. His legacy remained a point of contention, reflecting the broader conflicts and rivalries that plagued the Boltons.\",2\r\n171,RUBY FORD,\"Ruby Ford is a notable location in the fictional world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. Situated in the Riverlands, it lies near the area where Joffrey Baratheon and Sansa Stark are known to have gone riding, suggesting its proximity to key routes or landmarks frequented by nobility. The ford is positioned north of a stretch of the Green Fork, a river that becomes difficult to cross without the bridge at the Twins, indicating its strategic importance in regional travel and military movements.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Ruby Ford was occupied by Roose Bolton, a cunning and ruthless northern lord who played a significant role in the conflict. Bolton's control of the ford underscores its tactical value, as it likely served as a crossing point for armies or a defensive position. The location’s association with both leisurely activities and wartime occupation highlights its dual significance in both peacetime and conflict.\n\nOverall, Ruby Ford is a geographically and strategically important site, intertwined with the political and military dynamics of the Riverlands and the broader struggles for power in Westeros.\",1\r\n1407,FALL OF HARRENHAL,\"The Fall of Harrenhal is a significant event in which Roose Bolton seizes control of the formidable castle of Harrenhal. This pivotal moment occurs following a prisoner escape, which weakens the existing defenses and leadership, allowing Bolton to assert his dominance. As a result, the castle changes hands, marking a shift in power and influence in the region. Roose Bolton's takeover solidifies his strategic position and underscores his cunning and opportunistic nature in the broader conflicts of the time. The event highlights both the instability of Harrenhal's governance and Bolton's ability to capitalize on such chaos.\",1\r\n1487,SACK OF WINTERFELL,\"The Sack of Winterfell was a brutal and devastating event in which Winterfell, the ancestral seat of House Stark, was attacked, looted, and destroyed by the forces of Ramsay Bolton. This assault resulted in widespread death and capture among the castle's inhabitants, marking a dark chapter in the history of the North. Ramsay Bolton, acting under the authority of his father, Roose Bolton, played a central role in the sacking, though Roose later warned him against discussing the event openly, suggesting the Boltons sought to downplay or conceal the full extent of their actions. The Sack of Winterfell not only demonstrated Ramsay's ruthlessness but also solidified the Bolton family's treacherous rise to power in the North, as they betrayed their former allies, the Starks, to seize control of the region. The event left Winterfell in ruins, symbolizing the collapse of Stark rule and the beginning of Bolton dominance.\",1\r\n2311,BARROW HALL,\"Barrow Hall is a notable location in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, serving as a significant setting in the political and military events of the North.

Additionally, it is the place where Theon Greyjoy is brought to meet Barbrey Dustin, a formidable and cunning noblewoman who plays a role in the unfolding conflicts. The meeting between Theon and Barbrey Dustin at Barrow Hall highlights the hall’s significance as a gathering place for influential figures, where alliances and tensions are navigated.\n\nThe hall itself is likely a fortified structure, reflecting the martial culture of the North and the need for defense in a region often beset by conflict. Its association with House Dustin and its interactions with House Bolton underscore its relevance in the broader narrative of power, betrayal, and survival in Westeros.\",1\r\n2312,FIRST NIGHT,\"An illicit tradition practiced by Roose Bolton, involving the rape of a miller's wife\",1\r\n317,JEYNE,\"Jeyne is a complex and multifaceted character in the narrative, known by different names and roles. She is primarily identified as Jeyne Westerling, the daughter of Gawen Westerling, who was granted a royal pardon. Additionally, she is mistaken for Arya Stark due to her circumstances and appearance, particularly her frostbitten nose, which is blackened from the cold.\n\nJeyne is brought from Winterfell by Tycho Nestoris' group, where her resemblance to Arya Stark leads to her being impersonated as the young Stark girl. She becomes a captive of Ramsay Bolton, enduring mistreatment at his hands and those of his men. Her suffering is notable, as she is emotionally reactive to the harsh events around her, including the tourney where she accompanies Sansa Stark, displaying strong emotional responses.\n\nA pivotal moment in her story occurs during an escape attempt, where she screams, inadvertently revealing the group's position. This leads to dire consequences, as she is ultimately thrown over the battlements by Theon Greyjoy, marking a tragic end to her ordeal. Despite her suffering, she remains a key figure in the events surrounding the escape.\n\nJeyne is also referenced as Queen Jeyne, though she is notably absent from certain key events, such as a welcoming party. Additionally, she is mentioned in the context of being Robb Stark’s wife, raising questions about potential heirs and her role in the political landscape of the story.\n\nOverall, Jeyne’s character is marked by tragedy, deception, and emotional depth, as she navigates a world of political intrigue and personal suffering. Her story intertwines with major figures like Arya Stark, Sansa Stark, Ramsay Bolton, and Theon Greyjoy, making her a significant, if often overlooked, figure in the broader narrative.\",6\r\n1623,LOTHAR,\"Lothar Frey, commonly referred to as \"\"Lame Lothar,\"\" is a member of House Frey and plays a significant role in the events surrounding the infamous Red Wedding. As a key figure in the betrayal at the Red Wedding, Lothar is involved in masterminding the treacherous plot that results in the massacre of Robb Stark, his forces, and his allies. His actions are pivotal in the execution of this brutal scheme, orchestrated in collaboration with other Freys and their allies.\n\nLothar also serves as an intermediary between his father, Lord Walder Frey, and the Starks. He is tasked with delivering terms and negotiating with Catelyn Stark and Robb Stark, though these interactions are ultimately deceptive, as they lead to the Starks' downfall. His role in these negotiations highlights his position as a trusted agent of his father, despite his physical limitations, as indicated by his nickname \"\"Lame Lothar.\"\"\n\nDuring his interactions with Robb Stark and Grey Wind, Robb's direwolf, Lothar's demeanor and actions contribute to the tension and mistrust that foreshadow the betrayal. His presence in these critical moments underscores his involvement in the broader political machinations of House Frey, particularly their alliance with House Bolton and the Lannisters against the Starks.\n\nIn summary, Lothar Frey is a cunning and instrumental figure in the Red Wedding, acting as both a negotiator and a conspirator. His actions, though marked by deceit, are central to the execution of his father's plans, making him a notable antagonist in the conflict between House Frey and House Stark.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3375,RAMSAY,THEON,Ramsay is holding Theon Greyjoy captive and torturing him,71\r\n1025,ROOSE BOLTON,DREADFORT,\"Roose Bolton is the Lord of the Dreadfort, a formidable stronghold located in the North of Westeros.
