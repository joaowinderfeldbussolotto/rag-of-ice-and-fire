At seven years old, he is the younger brother of Arya Stark, whom she deeply misses. Bran is known for his adventurous spirit, particularly his love for climbing and his dreams of becoming a knight. He is also deeply connected to his direwolf, Summer, with whom he shares a unique bond.\n\nBran’s life takes a dramatic turn when he is pushed from a tower by Jaime Lannister, an event that leaves him paralyzed. This incident is part of an assassination attempt, highlighting his significance in the broader political conflicts of the realm. Despite his injuries, Bran remains resilient and continues to play a crucial role in Winterfell, eventually becoming the acting lord after his older brother Robb departs for war.\n\nBran is also known for his prophetic dreams and his contemplation of the red comet, which many believe to be an omen. His experiences and visions suggest a deeper connection to the mystical forces at work in the world. Additionally, Bran is mistakenly believed to have been killed by Theon Greyjoy during the sack of Winterfell, though he survives.\n\nAs a young prince of Winterfell, Bran embodies both the innocence of childhood and the weight of his family’s legacy. His journey from an energetic boy to a paralyzed but determined leader reflects his growth and the challenges he faces in a world filled with danger and intrigue.\",59\r\n417,DANCER,\"Dancer is the name of Bran's horse, specially equipped for his riding needs\",2\r\n31,MAESTER LUWIN,\"Maester Luwin is a learned scholar, healer, and advisor serving House Stark at Winterfell. As the maester of Winterfell, he provides counsel, wisdom, and medical care to the Stark family, including Bran, Robb, Rickon, Catelyn, and Ned Stark. His expertise is highly respected, and his advice is sought on matters ranging from political decisions to personal health.\n\nLuwin is a skeptic of supernatural tales, such as Osha’s stories and the existence of the Others, though he remains open to the possibility of Bran’s recovery after his fall. He educates Bran on various subjects, including history, banners, knights, and the nature of prophecies, often attempting to temper Bran’s curiosity with reason. He also interacts with other key figures, such as Theon Greyjoy, advising him on matters like yielding during conflicts.\n\nAs a healer, Luwin tends to injuries, examining Bran’s wounds, treating Catelyn’s ailments, and providing Bran with sleeping draughts to ease his discomfort. He is cautious in his approach, advising discretion in sensitive matters, such as suspicions about others. His role extends beyond physical care; he also serves as a stabilizing presence, attempting to calm Bran during moments of distress.\n\nLuwin wears a chain symbolizing his vast knowledge, including a link of Valyrian steel representing his understanding of magic. Despite his scholarly nature, he is not immune to danger, as seen when he is attacked by Shaggydog and later meets his end in the godswood. His dedication to the Starks is unwavering, even in his final moments, as he continues to serve and protect the family he has long advised. His legacy endures through the wisdom he imparted and the guidance he provided to those under his care.\",17\r\n192,SUMMER,,6\r\n413,JOSETH,\"Joseth is a man who serves as the Master of Horse at Winterfell, a position of responsibility overseeing the stables and horses.

Additionally, Joseth is known to have daughters who play with the Walders, likely referring to the children of House Frey, such as Walder Frey's descendants. This detail suggests a familial connection or at least a social interaction between his children and those of another noble house, further embedding him in the broader social fabric of Winterfell and its allies.\n\nOverall, Joseth is a multifaceted figure—both a trusted servant of Winterfell and a man with personal ties and responsibilities within the community.
