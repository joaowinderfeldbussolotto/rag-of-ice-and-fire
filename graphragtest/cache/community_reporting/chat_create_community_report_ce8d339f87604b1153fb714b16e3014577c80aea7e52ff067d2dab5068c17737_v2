This gruesome tactic underscored the ruthless measures employed by Joffrey to assert dominance and crush dissent.\n\nThe Antler Menâ€™s legacy is one of defiance against oppressive rule, though their methods and fate highlight the perilous consequences of challenging the Iron Throne during a time of war and political instability.

As the son of Cersei Lannister and Robert Baratheon, he inherits the throne following his father's death, though his legitimacy is often questioned. He is widely despised, particularly by Arya Stark, who blames him for the execution of her father, Lord Eddard Stark, an act that further cements his reputation for brutality.\n\nAs the ruler of Kingâ€™s Landing, King Joffrey is depicted as a petulant and insecure monarch, often preoccupied with his own power and prestige. During the Battle of the Blackwater, he complains bitterly about the loss of his ships and orders the use of catapults, demonstrating his impulsive and reckless approach to warfare. His leadership is marked by a lack of strategic foresight, relying instead on fear and intimidation to maintain control.\n\nAdditionally, King Joffrey is a figure of authority to whom Ser Alliser Thorne, a knight of the Nightâ€™s Watch, is sent, further illustrating his role as the central power in Westeros. His reign is characterized by cruelty, instability, and a deep-seated paranoia, making him one of the most reviled rulers in the history of the Seven Kingdoms.
