Daenerys, driven by her ambition to rule, plans to land in Westeros with an army and ships to retake the realm, though she initially deviates to Slaver's Bay before being urged to sail westward. The continent is also where the War of the Five Kings took place, and it remains a strategic target for other claimants, such as Aegon, who is advised to land there.\n\nWesteros is deeply tied to the Targaryen dynasty, with figures like Viserys and Daenerys striving to reclaim the throne, while Khal Drogo once vowed to invade it on Daenerys' behalf. Stannis Baratheon also lays claim to the Iron Throne, adding to the continent's political turmoil. The region is characterized by its distinct martial culture, particularly the hacking and hammering style of sword fighting, which contrasts with the Water Dance practiced in Braavos.\n\nAdditionally, Westeros is depicted on the Painted Table, a symbolic representation of its significance.

This bounty underscores the political danger the Targaryen siblings represent, as well as The Usurper's willingness to use violence and financial incentives to secure their position. Additionally, The Usurper is noted for offering a high reward specifically for Viserys's head, further emphasizing the targeted nature of their hostility toward the Targaryen lineage.\n\nThough unnamed in the descriptions, The Usurper's actions paint a picture of a calculating and power-hungry ruler, whose rise to power and subsequent reign are marked by the suppression of rival claims.
