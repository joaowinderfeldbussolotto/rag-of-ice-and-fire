He led a successful rebellion against the Targaryens, defeating Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in battle and claiming the throne for himself. His rebellion is often referenced in discussions about the fall of House Targaryen, including the murder of Elia Martell. Robert was a fearless and formidable warrior, known for his prowess in battle, though he was injured during the Battle of the Bells, where Jon Connington failed to kill him. He was also defeated by Randyll Tarly at Ashford, showcasing his complex military history.\n\nAs king, Robert ruled the Seven Kingdoms but was known to have changed after taking the crown, becoming more indulgent in wine and women. Despite his flaws, he was respected for his leadership and ability to turn foes into friends. He was fond of Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword, and he visited Winterfell, offering to marry his son Joffrey to Sansa Stark, though he was not particularly warm toward Joffrey. His reign was marked by political intrigue, and he was ridiculed in a song by a court singer, highlighting the mixed perceptions of his rule.\n\nRobert was the brother of Stannis Baratheon, and his death led to a significant power struggle in Westeros. His legitimacy as a ruler was questioned, particularly by Stannis, who claimed that Robert’s children—Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen—were not his trueborn heirs but rather the products of incest between Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister. Robert’s death is frequently referenced in political discussions, underscoring his lasting impact on the realm. He was also mentioned as a threat to the Targaryens, having ordered the assassination of Daenerys Targaryen when she was pregnant. Despite his flaws, Robert Baratheon remains a central figure in the history of Westeros, remembered for his warrior nature and his role in shaping the kingdom’s future.\",27\r\n878,NOYE,Noye is a smith who knew the Baratheon brothers well and forged Robert’s warhammer,4\r\n785,BARATHEON,\"House Baratheon is a noble family in the fictional world, prominently known for its members, including Robert, Stannis, Renly, and Steffon Baratheon.

Robert Baratheon, another key member, further solidifies the house's standing as a powerful and respected dynasty in the realm.

He was the father of Aegon Targaryen and the eldest brother of Daenerys Targaryen. Rhaegar played a significant role in the events leading up to Robert's Rebellion, a conflict that ultimately led to the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty. He fought valiantly in battle against Robert Baratheon but was ultimately defeated and killed, marking a pivotal moment in the war. Rhaegar's death further solidified Robert's claim to the Iron Throne and contributed to the exile of the remaining Targaryens, including his sister Daenerys.

To this end, he proposes a union between his son, Joffrey Baratheon, and Ned Stark's daughter, Sansa Stark, aiming to unite their powerful houses—House Baratheon and House Stark—through this betrothal. This alliance would not only reinforce political ties but also symbolize the enduring connection between the two men.
