Proclaimed King in the North, he leads the Stark forces and their allies, commanding the power of Winterfell and Riverrun. A skilled military leader, Robb achieves significant victories, including outmaneuvering Tywin Lannister’s forces and securing a triumph at Riverrun. He is known for his strategic prowess, leading armored horse columns and advancing south with his host, though this weakens Winterfell’s defenses.\n\nRobb plays a crucial role in political and military negotiations, sending peace terms to the Lannisters and proposing alliances, such as offering Balon Greyjoy a crown in exchange for attacking the westerlands. However, his leadership is marked by both triumph and tragedy. He breaks his pledge to the Freys by marrying Jeyne Westerling, leading to the loss of their alliance and ultimately contributing to his downfall. His actions, including beheading Rickard Karstark for killing prisoners, demonstrate his strict sense of justice but also strain his alliances.\n\nRobb’s relationships are complex; he is a friend to Theon Greyjoy but later becomes a threat to him. He is suspicious of Tyrion Lannister and hosts members of the Night’s Watch. His mother, Catelyn, acts as his envoy, negotiating peace between the Baratheon brothers. Despite his successes, Robb’s fate is sealed at the Red Wedding, where he is betrayed and killed, marking the end of his reign as King in the North and a devastating blow to House Stark. His death is a pivotal moment in the war, leaving his family and allies in disarray.\",82\r\n168,HALLIS MOLLEN,\"Hallis Mollen is a prominent figure in Winterfell, serving as the Captain of the Guard.

Additionally, Hallis Mollen is known for announcing the arrival of Stannis Baratheon’s foragers at a logging site, further highlighting his involvement in both military and logistical matters. As the new Captain of the Guard, he plays a key role in the governance and protection of Winterfell, ensuring the well-being of its inhabitants and the smooth execution of duties under his command.

Known for his fierce warrior spirit and immense strength, he is a key bannerman of House Stark. Initially, the Greatjon challenged Robb Stark’s authority but later became one of his most staunch and loyal supporters, playing a crucial role in proclaiming Robb as the King in the North. His unwavering loyalty to Robb Stark and House Stark is well-documented, as he actively supported Robb’s cause during the War of the Five Kings.\n\nAs a skilled commander, the Greatjon demonstrated his tactical prowess during battles, notably by ordering the firing of siege towers in a critical engagement. His reputation as a formidable warrior was such that Robb Stark once threatened to send him in place of Catelyn Stark, underscoring his fearsome nature. Despite his initial resistance to Robb’s leadership, the Greatjon’s eventual allegiance solidified his position as a vital ally to the Starks, reinforcing his role as a powerful and influential figure in the North. His leadership and combat skills made him an indispensable asset to Robb Stark’s campaign.\",3\r\n315,FREYS,\"House Frey is a noble family from the Riverlands, known for their significant influence and controversial actions during the War of the Five Kings. They are infamous for their betrayal at the Red Wedding, where they played a pivotal role in the massacre of Robb Stark and his forces, aligning themselves with House Bolton. This betrayal was partly motivated by Robb Stark’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which broke a prior marriage pact with the Freys, deepening their resentment.\n\nThe Freys hold considerable sway over Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, though their relationship is strained. They were responsible for the death of Ser Wendel Manderly during the sack of Winterfell and later brought his bones to the Manderlys, attempting to mend relations through proposed marriages. However, their past atrocities, including Wendel’s death, have left lasting enmity.\n\nAs advisors to Roose Bolton, the Freys believed in the inevitability of Robb Stark’s defeat and actively worked against the Northmen. They were involved in the siege of Riverrun and may have participated in attacks on Stannis Baratheon’s forces. Their presence in the North has been marked by tension, particularly after Edmure Tully’s return, which led some Frey members to depart.\n\nThe Freys are also known for their role in confirming the execution of Davos Seaworth, further solidifying their reputation as a ruthless and politically calculating house. Their bannermen and influence extend to various regions, including their involvement in the inn where key political discussions took place. Despite their power, their actions have earned them widespread distrust, particularly among the Northmen and other noble houses affected by their betrayals.\",12\r\n560,KARSTARKS,\"The Karstarks are a noble house from the North, sworn as bannermen to House Stark and known for their fierce nature. Led by Rickard Karstark, they share Stark blood and have historically been loyal allies of House Stark. The Karstarks arrived at Winterfell to join Robb Stark's army during the War of the Five Kings, demonstrating their allegiance to the Starks.\n\nHowever, their loyalty became complicated when they initially allied with Stannis Baratheon, who sought to claim the North. Despite this alliance, the Karstarks ultimately double-crossed Stannis by refusing to lead him into a trap at the Dreadfort, suggesting a shift in their allegiances or a strategic decision to avoid further conflict. This contradictory behavior highlights the complex political landscape of the North and the Karstarks' efforts to navigate it while maintaining their ties to House Stark.\n\nOverall, the Karstarks remain a significant and formidable house in the North, deeply connected to the Starks by blood and fealty, though their actions reflect the turbulent and shifting loyalties of the era.\",5\r\n916,STAFFORD LANNISTER,\"Ser Stafford Lannister is a prominent military leader of House Lannister, known for his role during the War of the Five Kings. As a seasoned commander, he was tasked with gathering and preparing forces at Casterly Rock, the ancestral seat of House Lannister, to bolster the Lannister war effort. His efforts included assembling a new host to reinforce Lannister strength in the Westerlands.\n\nHowever, Stafford Lannister's military campaigns ultimately met with defeat. He led a Lannister army that was crushed by Robb Stark, the young and formidable King in the North, at the Battle of Oxcross. This decisive battle resulted in the destruction of his levies, marking a significant setback for the Lannisters. Despite his preparations and strategic positioning, Stafford's forces were outmaneuvered by Robb Stark's superior tactics, leading to his downfall.\n\nStafford Lannister's role as a commander underscores the challenges faced by House Lannister during the conflict, as well as the rising threat posed by Robb Stark's military prowess. His defeat at Oxcross serves as a notable example of the shifting tides of war and the vulnerabilities of even well-prepared Lannister forces.\",4\r\n2230,MANDERLYS,\"The Manderlys are a noble family from White Harbor, a prominent city in the North of Westeros. As the ruling house of White Harbor, they hold significant political and economic influence in the region. The Manderlys are known for their involvement in political negotiations, often playing a crucial role in the intricate power dynamics of the North.\n\nOne notable event involving the Manderlys was their procession, which was followed by members of House Frey before the Freys mysteriously disappeared. This incident underscores the Manderlys' prominence and the tensions that can arise from their political engagements. Despite such challenges, the family remains a steadfast and respected presence in White Harbor, maintaining their authority and contributing to the stability of the North.\n\nThe Manderlys are recognized for their loyalty to House Stark, further solidifying their position as a key ally in the region. Their rule over White Harbor, combined with their strategic political maneuvering, ensures their continued significance in the broader landscape of Westeros.\",1\r\n1540,JEYNE WESTERLING,\"Jeyne Westerling is the wife of Robb Stark, a noblewoman from House Westerling, which is considered a house of relatively low birth compared to other prominent families in Westeros. She played a significant role in Robb Stark's life by nursing him back to health during a critical time, demonstrating her care and devotion. Despite her family's modest standing, her actions earned her a place in Robb's life and heart. Notably, Grey Wind, Robb Stark's direwolf, is said to have feared her, adding an intriguing layer to her character.
