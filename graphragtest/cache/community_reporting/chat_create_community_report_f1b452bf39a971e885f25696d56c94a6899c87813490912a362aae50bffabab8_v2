Worshipped by the Brotherhood Without Banners, R'hllor is revered as a god of light, fire, and good, standing in opposition to the Great Other, a malevolent force in the faith followed by Melisandre and her adherents. Thoros of Myr, a red priest, is a devoted follower of R'hllor and is closely associated with the miraculous resurrections of Beric Dondarrion, further cementing the deity's connection to life and renewal. Melisandre, another influential follower, leads a group of devotees who uphold R'hllor as their supreme god, emphasizing his role as a bringer of light and a protector against darkness. The Lord of Light is thus central to the spiritual practices of both Thoros and Beric Dondarrion, as well as the broader Brotherhood Without Banners, who see him as a guiding force in their struggles. This deity embodies themes of hope, divine power, and the eternal conflict between light and darkness.\",6\r\n1558,BERIC,\"BERIC, also known as Lord Beric Dondarrion, is a significant character in the lore of the Brotherhood Without Banners.
