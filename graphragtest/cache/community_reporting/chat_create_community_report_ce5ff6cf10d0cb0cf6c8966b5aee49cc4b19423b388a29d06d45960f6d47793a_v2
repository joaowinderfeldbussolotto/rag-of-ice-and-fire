Known for her independent and adventurous spirit, she prefers outdoor activities and often conflicts with authority figures, including Joffrey Baratheon. Arya is deeply connected to her family, particularly her brother Jon Snow, and frequently dreams of Winterfell, her ancestral home. She witnessed her father’s execution and associates the red comet with his greatsword, Ice, covered in blood.\n\nAfter escaping King’s Landing, Arya is abducted by Sandor Clegane, also known as the Hound, who later becomes an unlikely companion. She travels north, often disguised as a boy, and encounters the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group she briefly stays with before continuing her journey. During her travels, she is mistaken for another girl, Jeyne Poole, who falsely claims to be Arya Stark, leading to confusion about her true identity. Some, including Jaime Lannister, doubt the authenticity of these claims.\n\nArya’s whereabouts are often uncertain, with conflicting reports about her capture or safety. At one point, she is believed to be in the custody of Roose Bolton, and there are even plans for her marriage to his bastard son. Cersei Lannister seeks Arya as a target, and Jaime Lannister is tasked with retrieving her, though he would have killed her if given the chance. Despite these threats, Arya remains resourceful, escaping capture multiple times.\n\nShe later travels to Braavos, where she trains to become a Faceless Man in the House of Black and White, honing her skills as an assassin. Before this, she also trains in swordplay, aspiring to become a water dancer. Throughout her journey, Arya remains determined to reunite with her family, though her path is fraught with danger and deception. Her resilience and adaptability define her as one of the most compelling figures in her family’s struggle for survival.\",47\r\n165,VAYON POOLE,\"Vayon Poole is a steward of Winterfell who accompanied Lord Eddard Stark when he traveled south to serve as the Hand of the King in King’s Landing.

Vayon Poole also served as a guard or vouching person for Arya Stark while she was in the Red Keep, ensuring her safety during her time there.\n\nAdditionally, Vayon Poole was responsible for waking Ned Stark from a troubling dream, demonstrating his close and attentive service to the Lord of Winterfell. He also brought important news to Ned, informing him that Arya had been found unharmed, which provided relief to the Stark family during a tense period. Throughout his service, Vayon Poole remained a loyal and dependable figure, fulfilling multiple roles in support of House Stark while in the south.
