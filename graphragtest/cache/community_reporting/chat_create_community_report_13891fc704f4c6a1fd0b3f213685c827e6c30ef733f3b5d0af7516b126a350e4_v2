It is most notably remembered for the death of Rhaegar Targaryen, the crown prince of the Targaryen dynasty, who was defeated and killed in the battle. The battle also saw the valor of Barristan Selmy, a renowned knight, who slew many enemies of Robert Baratheon, contributing significantly to the rebel forces' victory.\n\nThe battle's outcome was further influenced by the late arrival of House Frey, whose forces joined the fight only after the decisive moments had passed. This delay underscored Lord Frey's unreliability and became a notable aspect of the battle's historical account. Despite their tardiness, the Freys' eventual participation did not alter the fact that the battle had already been won by Robert Baratheon's forces.\n\nThe Battle of the Trident solidified Robert Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne and dealt a crushing blow to the Targaryen loyalists. The death of Rhaegar Targaryen, in particular, was a major strategic and symbolic victory for the rebels, as it removed one of the most formidable leaders of the Targaryen forces. The battle's legacy is thus one of both military significance and political consequence, shaping the future of Westeros.\",2\r\n407,RHAEGAR,\"Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was a prominent and complex figure in the history of the Seven Kingdoms, known for his dual nature as both a scholar and a warrior. As the heir to King Aerys II Targaryen, Rhaegar was deeply intertwined with the political and prophetic narratives of his time, often referenced in Maester Aemon’s prophecies and visions experienced by others, including Daenerys Targaryen. His legacy is marked by both admiration and controversy, particularly due to his actions and relationships that led to significant consequences.\n\nRhaegar played a pivotal role in the events leading to Robert’s Rebellion, notably his involvement with Lyanna Stark, which sparked a chain reaction of conflict. His love for Lyanna, contrasted with his duty, became a defining aspect of his story, though it also led to thousands of deaths and the eventual downfall of House Targaryen. He was a figure of honor and loyalty, often compared to his sister Daenerys, yet his life was cut short in the Battle of the Trident, where he was killed by Robert Baratheon.\n\nBefore his death, Rhaegar was a respected member of the Kingsguard and was remembered fondly by those who knew him, including Jaime Lannister, who recalled conversations with him. His children, born of his union with Elia Martell, were tragically targeted for death to secure Robert Baratheon’s claim to the throne, further cementing the tragic nature of his legacy. Additionally, Rhaegar was accused of being betrayed by Grand Maester Pycelle, as suggested by Tyrion Lannister, adding another layer of intrigue to his story.\n\nRhaegar’s character was also contrasted with that of his brother Viserys, highlighting his more temperate and noble demeanor. He was known for his artistic talents, particularly his skill with the silver harp, which was mentioned in Daenerys’s visions. His visit to Jon Connington’s home and his interactions with figures like Brandon Stark, who challenged him, further illustrate his significance in the broader political landscape of Westeros.\n\nUltimately, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen remains a figure of fascination, embodying the ideals and tragedies of House Targaryen. His life and death shaped the future of the realm, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence the events of Westeros long after his passing.\",9\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n492,WALDER FREY,BATTLE OF THE TRIDENT,\"Walder Frey arrived late to the Battle of the Trident, an action that raised significant doubts about his loyalty and was widely perceived as a display of disloyalty.
