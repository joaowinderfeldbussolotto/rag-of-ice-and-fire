Initially an adventurous child who enjoys climbing and dreams of knighthood, Bran’s life changes dramatically after he witnesses Cersei and Jaime Lannister together, leading to Jaime pushing him out a window. This fall leaves him paralyzed from the waist down, though he survives an assassination attempt by a Valyrian dagger. Despite his physical limitations, Bran develops extraordinary abilities, including prophetic dreams and the power to warg into his direwolf, Summer, and other animals.\n\nAfter his injury, Bran remains bedridden for a time, recovering under the care of Maester Luwin and his family. He becomes deeply introspective, dreaming of the past, present, and future, often guided by visions of the Three-Eyed Crow. As tensions rise in Winterfell, Bran is pursued by Theon Greyjoy, who fails to capture him, leading to Bran’s escape with companions including Hodor, Meera and Jojen Reed, and Osha. While Rickon is taken south by Osha, Bran travels north with the Reeds, seeking the Three-Eyed Crow beyond the Wall.\n\nBran’s journey takes him through the haunted forest, where he encounters Coldhands, a mysterious figure who aids him. He learns to harness his warg abilities and skinchanging powers, gaining insights into the supernatural world. Along the way, he interacts with figures like Samwell Tarly and Gilly at the Nightfort, though his survival is kept secret. Bran’s significance grows as he becomes a key figure in the magical and political struggles of Westeros, with his visions and abilities marking him as a potential leader or seer.\n\nDespite his physical frailty, Bran’s intelligence, resilience, and supernatural gifts make him a vital character. His story intertwines with the broader conflicts of his family, the Starks, and the mystical forces shaping the fate of the realm.

The tree is notable for its carved face, a common characteristic of weirwoods, and is often depicted with red sap resembling blood, which weeps from its eyes—a detail observed by Samwell Tarly during his studies.\n\nAt Whitetree, another significant location, a similar weirwood tree with a carved face holds importance, reinforcing the broader cultural and religious reverence for these trees. The Heart Tree at Winterfell, however, remains the most iconic, standing at the heart of the godswood as a focal point for prayer and communion with the divine. Its presence underscores the connection between the Stark family and the ancient faith of the North, embodying both historical and mystical significance in the lore of the region.\",2\r\n1247,THE THREE-EYED CROW,\"The Three-Eyed Crow is a mysterious and mystical figure central to Bran Stark's journey in the haunted forest beyond the Wall.

Once a lord named Brynden, the Three-Eyed Crow carries deep knowledge of the realm's history and magic, serving as a mentor to Bran. His presence is shrouded in secrecy, existing in a hidden sanctuary where time and space blur, making him a pivotal yet elusive figure in Bran's destiny.\",2\r\n126,BRAN'S SURVIVAL,The event of Bran potentially recovering from his coma,1\r\n196,BRAN'S MOTHER,\"Catelyn Stark, who is seen contemplating a blood-stained knife aboard a ship on the Narrow Sea\",1\r\n197,BRAN'S FATHER,\"Bran's father, Eddard Stark, is a deceased figure who holds significant emotional weight for his sons, Bran and Rickon, as they have dreamed about him in the crypts of their ancestral home. Eddard Stark, also known as Ned Stark, is remembered for his pivotal role in the political landscape of Westeros, particularly in his interactions with the ruling monarchy. One notable moment in his life was when he was seen pleading with the King near the Trident, a scene that underscores his loyalty and sense of duty. His death left a profound impact on his family, especially his children, who continue to reflect on his legacy and the values he stood for. Eddard Stark is revered as a noble and honorable man, whose actions and decisions shaped the fate of his house and the realm.\",1\r\n414,UNCLE BENJEN,\"Uncle Benjen is a significant figure in the narrative, known for his dual roles as a member of the Night's Watch and a missing relative of Bran and Robb Stark. His absence is a source of concern for his family, particularly Bran and Robb, who are deeply affected by his disappearance. Unlike Yoren, another member of the Night's Watch, Uncle Benjen's appearance and demeanor are notably different, though the specifics of these contrasts are not detailed. His involvement with the Night's Watch places him in a position of duty and peril, while his familial ties to the Stark family add emotional weight to his character. The narrative emphasizes both his role in the broader conflict beyond the Wall and the personal impact of his absence on his loved ones.\",1\r\n157,WOLFSWOOD,\"Wolfswood is a dense forest located north of Winterfell, playing a significant role in the region's geography and the events of the story. It is a forested area near Winterfell, often mentioned in the context of key moments involving the Stark family. The forest is similar to the haunted forest but carries a less ominous atmosphere, making it a frequent setting for rides and encounters.\n\nBran Stark and his brother Robb are known to have ridden through Wolfswood, where they encountered direwolves and outlaws, marking pivotal moments in their lives. The forest is also where Bran had an incident, further cementing its importance in the narrative. Additionally, Wolfswood is situated near the crofters' village, adding to its strategic and cultural significance in the region.\n\nBeyond its association with the Starks, Wolfswood serves as a route for military movements, as seen when Stannis Baratheon's host marched through it to reach Winterfell. The forest's proximity to Winterfell and its role in various events make it a notable location in the broader story, blending natural beauty with historical and strategic importance.\",1\r\n421,HALI,A short woman among the outlaws who insults Bran,1\r\n422,WALLEN,A gaunt man among the outlaws who recognizes Bran as a Stark,1\r\n837,FIRST KEEP,A tower in Winterfell where Bran fell and was injured,1\r\n845,FALL,The incident where Bran fell from the First Keep and was paralyzed,1\r\n846,KNIGHTHOOD,\"**Summary of Knighthood**\n\nKnighthood is depicted as an aspirational yet often unattainable ideal in the context of the provided descriptions. For Bran, knighthood was once a cherished dream, symbolizing honor, valor, and purpose. However, his injury has rendered this ambition impossible, highlighting the physical and perhaps symbolic barriers that can prevent one from achieving such a status. This reflects the harsh reality that knighthood is not merely a title but a demanding role that requires physical capability and dedication.\n\nSimilarly, Ser Barristan Selmy, a renowned knight himself, contemplates the possibility of training his squires to become knights. His consideration underscores the traditional path to knighthood, which involves mentorship, rigorous training, and the passing down of values. However, Barristan ultimately decides against pursuing this due to his impending death, suggesting that the process of becoming a knight is not only time-consuming but also dependent on the guidance of experienced figures. His decision reflects the weight of responsibility and the recognition that knighthood is a legacy that requires continuity and commitment.\n\nTogether, these descriptions portray knighthood as both a noble aspiration and a challenging, sometimes elusive, goal. It is a status that demands physical prowess, mentorship, and personal sacrifice, making it a revered yet difficult path to follow. The narratives of Bran and Barristan illustrate the personal and external obstacles that can stand in the way of achieving knighthood, emphasizing its significance and the complexities surrounding it.\",1\r\n844,KING SLAYER,A person Bran wishes to harm in his wolf form,1\r\n1030,HARVEST FEAST,\"Harvest Feast is an event hosted by Bran Stark at Winterfell, a significant gathering that marks a time of celebration and communal bonding.

Additionally, he is tasked with leading new guests to feasts, further emphasizing his role as a servant or possibly a guard. Bran Stark once commands Alebelly not to bathe, adding a peculiar detail to his character.

Known for his wild and sometimes violent behavior, Rickon is characterized by his uncut hair and fierce demeanor, despite being only half the age of his older brother Robb. He remains a child throughout much of his story, often seen playing with the Stark direwolves, particularly Shaggydog, with whom he shares a close bond.\n\nDuring the tumultuous events following his father’s death, Rickon stays in Winterfell with his mother, Catelyn, and is later pursued by Theon Greyjoy, who fails to capture him. Reports initially suggest he was killed alongside Bran, but these claims prove false. Instead, Rickon is taken south by Osha, possibly to White Harbor, to ensure his safety. He shares a significant dream with Bran about their father in the crypts of Winterfell, hinting at a deeper connection between the brothers.\n\nRickon is often seen in the company of Bran, waiting with him for news from Maester Luwin or comforting each other during tense moments.

He is a wise and knowledgeable advisor, particularly to Bran Stark, providing guidance and education to the young lord. Luwin is known for his stern yet caring demeanor, often chastising the Walders—Walder Frey’s grandsons—for their misbehavior while ensuring Bran’s well-being.\n\nAs a maester, Luwin plays a crucial role in disseminating important information, keeping Bran and Rickon informed about their brother Robb Stark’s military victories and other significant news. His duties extend beyond mere counsel, as he also possesses a deep understanding of the crannogmen’s secret knowledge, hinting at his broader expertise in the lore and traditions of the North.\n\nLuwin is also depicted as a pragmatic and principled figure. When Theon Greyjoy faces dire circumstances, Luwin advises him to take the black and join the Night’s Watch, offering a path to redemption. Additionally, his adherence to the maesters' ethical codes is evident when he is forbidden from attempting to reattach severed heads—a darkly humorous yet telling detail about his role and limitations.\n\nOverall, Maester Luwin is a steadfast and intellectual presence in Winterfell, embodying the wisdom and responsibility of his order while serving as a mentor and advisor to the Stark family.

Though he dislikes being skinchanged by Bran, who can control his body through magical abilities, Hodor remains protective of him, even calming under Bran’s influence. His size, while impressive, is noted to be smaller than that of Ser Gregor Clegane, emphasizing his formidable yet gentle nature.\n\nHodor’s role extends beyond physical assistance; he also defends Bran, chasing away threats like wolves and enduring insults from others, such as the Walders.

Bran Stark actively seeks out the Three-Eyed Crow, drawn by the figure’s reputation as a dreamer and a guardian of ancient knowledge. As Bran’s mentor, the Three-Eyed Crow imparts wisdom about the mystical forces at play in their world, shaping Bran’s understanding of his own gifts and the greater mysteries of the realm.\n\nThe Three-Eyed Crow’s identity as the last greenseer underscores his significance, marking him as a rare and vital figure in a world where such powers are fading.

He warns Bran about the dangers of his abilities, particularly the risks of spending too much time inhabiting the body of his direwolf, Summer. Jojen’s counsel is crucial in Bran’s journey, as he informs Sam about Bran’s significance to Coldhands and accompanies Bran on his quest north in search of the mysterious three-eyed crow.\n\nDespite his wisdom, Jojen is physically frail, suffering from illness and weakness exacerbated by hunger and the harsh cold. His condition worsens over time, marked by fits of shaking and a growing solemnity. Nevertheless, his presence in the godswood of Winterfell and his unwavering belief in his visions solidify his role as a key figure in Bran’s story. Jojen’s prophetic dreams and his guidance shape Bran’s path, making him an indispensable ally in the unfolding events beyond the Wall.\",6\r\n1243,GREENSIGHT,\"A ability or phenomenon that Jojen possesses, allowing him to see true dreams\",1\r\n1344,WARG,\"WARG is an individual with the unique ability to enter the minds of animals, a power that evokes fear in Bran, who worries about the potential consequences of being labeled as such. WARG is specifically known as a type of skinchanger—a person capable of inhabiting and controlling the bodies of animals—with a particular affinity for leading a pack of wolves. This dual nature of WARG, as both a feared entity and a leader of wolves, underscores their mysterious and formidable presence. Their abilities set them apart from ordinary individuals, marking them as a significant and potentially dangerous figure in the context of their world. The connection to wolves further emphasizes their wild and untamed essence, reinforcing the idea that WARG operates beyond the boundaries of conventional human experience.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n139,BRAN,SER RODRIK CASSEL,\"Bran is trained in combat by Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms of Winterfell\",91\r\n2084,CLEY CERWYN,BRAN,Cley Cerwyn is a friend to Bran Stark,91\r\n273,HEART TREE,BRAN,Bran sees the heart tree in the godswood of Winterfell in his vision,90\r\n4478,THE THREE-EYED CROW,BRAN,The Three-Eyed Crow teaches Bran about his greenseer abilities,90\r\n167,BRAN,BRAN'S SURVIVAL,Bran's survival is a key event in the story,89\r\n275,BRAN,BRAN'S MOTHER,\"Bran sees his mother, Catelyn Stark, aboard a ship on the Narrow Sea\",89\r\n276,BRAN,BRAN'S FATHER,\"Bran sees his father, Eddard Stark, pleading with the King near the Trident\",89\r\n692,BRAN,UNCLE BENJEN,Uncle Benjen is a missing relative whose absence concerns Bran and Robb,89\r\n693,BRAN,WOLFSWOOD,\"Bran, accompanied by his brother Robb, ventured into the Wolfswood during an outing.
