Initially betrothed to Prince Joffrey Baratheon as part of a political alliance, she is later forced into marriage with Tyrion Lannister, whom she does not love. Throughout her time in King’s Landing, Sansa endures mistreatment and abuse from Joffrey and others, including the loss of her direwolf, Lady, and the trauma of witnessing her father’s execution. Despite her hardships, she navigates the treacherous political landscape with caution and diplomacy, often masking her true feelings to survive.\n\nSansa is deeply affected by the Red Wedding and the fate of her family, grieving for those she has lost while remaining a key figure in the political intrigues of the Red Keep. She interacts with notable figures such as Ser Dontos Hollard, Varys, and Sandor Clegane (the Hound), who saves her during a riot and with whom she develops a complex relationship. After escaping King’s Landing, she is taken to the Eyrie under the protection of Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger), where she is disguised as Alayne Stone and begins to learn the art of political manipulation.\n\nAs the rightful heir to Winterfell, Sansa’s potential fertility and future offspring become points of concern for those vying for control of the North. She is sought by Brienne of Tarth, who is tasked with finding and protecting her, and she remains a central figure in the broader conflicts of Westeros. Despite her initial naivety and preference for comfort over the harsh realities of her world, Sansa grows into a more astute and observant young woman, sculpting a snow castle resembling Winterfell as a symbol of her longing for home. Her journey is marked by both personal loss and gradual empowerment as she learns to navigate the dangers around her.\",73\r\n227,TOURNEY,\"The TOURNEY is a significant medieval tournament, often taking the form of a jousting competition, attended by notable figures such as Sansa Stark, who observes the event with excitement, and Arya Stark, who dislikes it. One such TOURNEY was ordered by the king to honor Ned Stark’s appointment as Hand of the King, drawing large crowds and increasing crime in King’s Landing, necessitating additional security measures. The event is also historically notable as the setting where King Baelor met his demise in a tragic mishap.\n\nIn a more recent iteration, the TOURNEY was organized by Prince Joffrey Baratheon, who ultimately called it off in disgust. Despite this, the competition featured prominent knights, including the Hound, who emerged victorious by saving the life of the Knight of Flowers, Loras Tyrell. The TOURNEY serves as a spectacle of martial skill and chivalry, reflecting the political and social dynamics of the realm, while also highlighting the contrasting perspectives of its attendees, such as Sansa’s enthusiasm and Arya’s disdain.\",11\r\n175,LADY,,5\r\n1301,DONTOS,\"Dontos is a complex character in the narrative, initially introduced as a former knight who has fallen into disgrace and become a court fool. Known for his drunkenness, he interacts frequently with Sansa Stark, offering her warnings and assistance. Dontos is the one who cautions Sansa about the Tyrells' hidden intentions and later devises a plan to help her escape from King’s Landing. His actions suggest a mix of genuine concern for Sansa’s well-being and a desire to redeem himself from his past failures.\n\nDespite his diminished status, Dontos retains a sense of chivalry, attempting to comfort Sansa during her distress. However, his efforts are often met with humiliation, particularly by Joffrey Baratheon, who delights in degrading him. This dynamic underscores Dontos’ tragic position as a once-respected knight reduced to a figure of ridicule. His interactions with Sansa also involve references to other key figures, such as Varys and Moon Boy, hinting at his entanglement in the broader political intrigues of the court.\n\nDontos plays a significant role in the events surrounding King Joffrey’s death. He is accused of involvement in the poisoning, though the extent of his culpability remains ambiguous. Prior to this, he gives Sansa a hairnet, a seemingly innocuous gift that later becomes tied to the conspiracy. Additionally, he advises Sansa to lock herself in her room for safety, demonstrating his protective instincts, even as his own fate becomes increasingly precarious.\n\nThroughout his arc, Dontos embodies the themes of fall from grace, redemption, and the blurred lines between loyalty and self-interest. His relationship with Sansa is central to his character, as he becomes one of the few figures in the court who shows her kindness, albeit in a flawed and complicated manner. His ultimate fate, tied to the tumultuous events of Joffrey’s reign, cements his role as a tragic figure caught in the machinations of power.\",5\r\n100,SEPTA MORDANE,\"Septa Mordane is a significant mentor and governess figure in the lives of Sansa and Arya Stark, overseeing their education, behavior, and moral development. As a septa—a member of the Faith of the Seven—she serves as both a religious guide and a strict guardian, ensuring the Stark children adhere to proper conduct and etiquette. She plays a particularly prominent role in Sansa’s upbringing, advising her on noble behavior and accompanying her to important events, such as the tourney and appearances in the throne room. Sansa holds her in high regard, often missing her guidance and presence, especially after her untimely death.\n\nSepta Mordane’s responsibilities extend beyond Sansa, as she also interacts with Arya, though her strict oversight sometimes leads to tension, particularly during tasks like packing. Despite her stern demeanor, she is a consistent figure in the Stark household, shaping the young women’s understanding of duty and decorum. Tragically, her life ends when she is executed as a traitor, leaving a lasting impact on Sansa, who remembers her fondly. Additionally, there is a notable moment where she is found asleep at a table, unresponsive to Sansa’s attempts to wake her, adding a layer of vulnerability to her otherwise disciplined character. Through her role as governess and mentor, Septa Mordane remains a pivotal figure in the early lives of the Stark sisters.\",4\r\n102,JEYNE POOLE,\"Jeyne Poole is a close companion and best friend of Sansa Stark, often seen by her side in various settings. She is depicted as a confidante with whom Sansa whispers about courtly matters, including discussions about Prince Joffrey’s affections for Sansa. Jeyne is also shown riding with Sansa to a tourney, highlighting their shared experiences and bond. Sansa deeply misses her, underscoring the significance of their friendship.\n\nHowever, Jeyne Poole’s life takes a dark turn when she is forced to impersonate Arya Stark as part of Ramsay Bolton’s schemes. Under duress, she becomes an impostor, pretending to be Arya Stark to fulfill Ramsay’s cruel intentions. This deception marks a tragic shift in her story, as she is manipulated into a role far removed from her original identity as Sansa’s friend. Earlier in the narrative, she is portrayed as distraught and crying over her father’s fate, adding to the emotional depth of her character.\n\nJeyne Poole’s journey reflects both her loyalty to Sansa and the harsh realities of the world she inhabits, where she is ultimately used as a pawn in a larger, sinister plot. Her character serves as a poignant example of how innocence and friendship can be exploited in times of conflict and deception.\",3\r\n336,SER MERYN TRANT,\"Ser Meryn Trant is a knight of the Kingsguard, sworn to protect the royal family of the Seven Kingdoms. He is known for his loyalty to Queen Cersei Lannister, often serving her interests and acting as one of her few potential champions in a trial by combat. His duties extend beyond mere protection, as he is frequently involved in enforcing the will of the crown, even when it involves harsh or cruel actions.\n\nOne of his notable actions includes striking Sansa Stark on the orders of King Joffrey Baratheon, demonstrating his willingness to carry out brutal commands without hesitation. Additionally, he is tasked with capturing Arya Stark, further illustrating his role in the Lannister regime’s efforts to suppress their enemies. His presence is also marked during key moments, such as when he escorts Cersei out of a confrontation, reinforcing his position as a trusted and reliable enforcer for the queen.\n\nDespite his loyalty to Cersei, Ser Meryn Trant is not without controversy. His actions often reflect the ruthless nature of the Lannister rule, and he is seen as a tool of oppression by those who oppose the crown. Nevertheless, his standing as a member of the Kingsguard and his potential role as a champion in a trial by combat underscore his importance within the royal hierarchy.

It is notably associated with Sansa Stark, who was confined within its walls during her time in the capital. The Holdfast was the site of a tense confrontation between Sansa and Joffrey Baratheon, highlighting its role as a place of both confinement and political intrigue. Additionally, it is known as the location where Sansa was locked up, underscoring its function as a secure, though oppressive, space within the royal complex. The fortress embodies the power and control of the ruling monarchy, reflecting the harsh realities of life in the Red Keep.\",1\r\n1095,SER PRESTON,\"Ser Preston is a member of the Kingsguard, the elite order of knights sworn to protect the royal family of the Seven Kingdoms.

His actions reflect his commitment to duty and the protection of the realm's rulers.\",1\r\n1304,SER DONTOS,\"Ser Dontos is a character in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series who plays a significant role in Sansa Stark's story. Initially, he is a disgraced knight whom Sansa encounters and wishes to beg for help to escape her dire circumstances. Despite his own struggles, Ser Dontos becomes a key figure in Sansa’s life, ultimately aiding her in escaping from King’s Landing. He reassures her about the wildlings, offering a sense of hope and protection during a perilous time. His actions demonstrate both his loyalty to Sansa and his desire to redeem himself, making him a complex and pivotal character in her journey.\",1\r\n823,THE RED KEEP,The Red Keep is the royal castle where the tourney and other events take place,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n371,SANSA,TOURNEY,\"SANSA is eagerly anticipating her attendance at the TOURNEY, filled with excitement about the upcoming events.

Mordane often provided counsel to Sansa, including advising her not to question her father, Lord Eddard Stark's decisions, reinforcing the importance of obedience and respect within their household.\n\nDespite her role as a trusted mentor, Septa Mordane met a tragic end when she was executed as a traitor. The circumstances surrounding her death remain tied to the political turmoil of the time, reflecting the brutal consequences of the power struggles in Westeros. Her execution marked a turning point for Sansa, who lost not only a teacher but also a stabilizing presence in her life. Mordane's fate underscored the harsh realities of the world Sansa was navigating, where loyalty and trust could swiftly turn to betrayal and violence.\",77\r\n128,SANSA,JEYNE POOLE,\"Sansa Stark and Jeyne Poole share a close and supportive relationship, marked by companionship and mutual care.
