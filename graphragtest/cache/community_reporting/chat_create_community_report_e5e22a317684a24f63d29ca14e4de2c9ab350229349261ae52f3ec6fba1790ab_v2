As the childhood home of Catelyn Stark (née Tully), it holds deep personal significance for her, serving as a place of reflection, grief, and familial duty. The castle is also where Hoster Tully, Catelyn’s father, resides in his final days, and where his funeral later takes place.\n\nStrategically, Riverrun is a key location in the war, frequently targeted by Lannister forces. It has been under siege multiple times, with Jaime Lannister attempting to secure control to suppress rebellion. Despite its resistance, the castle eventually yields under pressure, though it remains a symbol of defiance. Robb Stark, Catelyn’s son, uses Riverrun as a base of operations, holding court and negotiating with envoys, while also marshaling forces to defend against Lannister invasions. The castle is where Robb leaves his wife and where his forces defeat Jaime Lannister’s army, marking a significant victory.\n\nRiverrun is also a destination for several characters. Catelyn seeks to return there, crossing dangerous territories to reunite with her family. Arya Stark, her daughter, is brought toward Riverrun, with plans for her ransom by the Brotherhood Without Banners or Sandor Clegane. Edmure Tully, Catelyn’s brother, is returned to Riverrun after a defeat, where he faces political negotiations and threats, including demands for his surrender or execution by Emmon Frey.\n\nThe castle’s history is rich, having played a role in Robert’s Rebellion and serving as a ward for figures like Petyr Baelish. It is also a place of tragedy, where Willem Lannister and Tion Frey were murdered. Despite its shifting control—sometimes under Tully rule, other times under Lannister occupation—Riverrun remains a symbol of House Tully’s legacy and resilience in the face of war.\",31\r\n731,TUMBLESTONE,\"The Tumblestone is a river situated near Riverrun, forming a significant part of the strategic landscape in the region. It gained particular historical importance during a notable battle when Lord Brax and his men attempted to cross its waters. The river's location and characteristics likely played a crucial role in the conflict, influencing the movements and tactics of the forces involved. As a geographical feature, the Tumblestone contributes to the defensive and logistical considerations of Riverrun, making it a key element in the area's military and strategic significance. Its name and role in the battle underscore its relevance in the broader context of regional history and warfare.\",1\r\n549,HOSTER TULLY,\"Lord Hoster Tully was a prominent nobleman and the head of House Tully, serving as the Lord of Riverrun. He was the father of Catelyn Stark and the grandfather of Sansa Stark, making him a significant figure in both the Tully and Stark families. In his later years, Hoster Tully suffered from a prolonged illness, leaving him too weak to participate in important political matters, such as the mission to Renly Baratheon or other critical meetings.\n\nDespite his declining health, Hoster Tully remained a respected figure, known for his past actions, including coming to the aid of Robert Baratheon. His condition weighed heavily on his daughter, Catelyn, who wished to be by his side rather than engaging in political negotiations. Hoster Tully’s death marked the end of an era for House Tully, and his passing was noted in visions by the Ghost of High Heart, further emphasizing his significance in the realm’s history. His legacy endured through his family, particularly his daughter Catelyn and granddaughter Sansa, who carried on his influence in the political landscape of Westeros.\",8\r\n482,EDMURE TULLY,\"Edmure Tully is a prominent nobleman and the Lord of Riverrun, serving as a key figure in House Tully. He is the younger brother of Catelyn Stark and the uncle of Robb Stark, making him a significant ally in the Stark-Tully alliance during the War of the Five Kings. Edmure is known for his role in defending Riverrun, where he dispersed men to guard border holdfasts and engaged the Lannister forces, though his actions inadvertently disrupted Robb Stark’s strategic plans.\n\nEdmure’s leadership was tested during the Red Wedding, where his wedding to Roslin Frey became the site of the infamous betrayal orchestrated by House Frey and House Bolton. Following the massacre, he was captured by the Freys and later held as a prisoner by the Lannisters, often referred to mockingly as a \"\"trout\"\" in messages. Despite his captivity, his wife Roslin remained pregnant, adding a personal dimension to his political predicament.\n\nAt one point, Edmure was offered in exchange for Sybell Spicer, highlighting his value as a captive nobleman. However, he was later liberated by Lord Blackwood during a battle, though his freedom was short-lived as he was recaptured. Throughout his imprisonment, he remained a symbol of resistance and a potential ally for Robb Stark’s cause. Additionally, Edmure played a role in the return of Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, by sending Robin Ryger to escort him to Riverrun.\n\nEdmure’s character is marked by his loyalty to family and duty, though his decisions sometimes had unintended consequences. His presence at key meetings and his actions during the war underscore his importance in the political and military landscape of Westeros. Despite his captivity, his legacy as Lord of Riverrun and his ties to House Stark and House Tully remain central to his identity.\",23\r\n475,RED FORK,\"The Red Fork is a significant river in the realm, playing a crucial role in various military and strategic operations. It is closely associated with House Tully, as it flows near Riverrun, their ancestral seat, and serves as a key defensive line where border holdfasts are maintained. During conflicts, the river has been a site of notable engagements, including a battle where Edmure Tully's forces successfully repelled the troops of Tywin Lannister, demonstrating its importance in regional defense.\n\nAdditionally, the Red Fork has been a target for supply train raids, further highlighting its strategic value in wartime logistics. The river also features in the movements of key figures, such as Jaime Lannister, whose boat was recorded traveling downstream along its waters. Its proximity to Riverrun and its influence on military strategies underscore its broader significance in the political and martial landscape of the region. The Red Fork thus stands as both a natural boundary and a critical asset in the power dynamics of the area.\",3\r\n759,BLACKFISH,\"Brynden Tully, commonly known as the Blackfish, is a prominent and respected figure in the realm of Westeros. As a key military leader and a prominent member of House Tully, he plays a crucial role in the political and martial affairs of the Riverlands. Ser Brynden is the uncle of Catelyn Stark, further cementing his ties to the influential families of the North and the Riverlands. Renowned for his unwavering dedication and strategic prowess, he is often referred to as the defender of Riverrun, a title that underscores his commitment to protecting his family’s ancestral seat.\n\nThe Blackfish is also known for his stern and principled nature, serving as a figure who reminds others, such as his nephew Edmure Tully, of their duties and responsibilities. His leadership and loyalty to House Tully make him a formidable and respected presence, both on and off the battlefield. Whether through his military acumen or his steadfast adherence to honor, Brynden Tully embodies the values of his house and remains a pivotal character in the broader narrative of Westeros.\",3\r\n1769,GAWEN WESTERLING,\"Lord Gawen Westerling is a nobleman who was granted a royal pardon, though his family remains in a precarious position. His family, the Westerlings, is held captive by the Blackfish, a formidable and rebellious figure, which places Gawen in a difficult political and personal situation. Despite his pardon, the captivity of his kin likely influences his standing and decisions within the realm. The circumstances surrounding his family’s imprisonment and his own pardon suggest a complex interplay of loyalty, power, and survival in the turbulent political landscape they inhabit. Lord Gawen’s role reflects the broader struggles of noble houses caught between conflicting loyalties and the harsh realities of war and governance.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n48,RIVERRUN,NED STARK,\"Riverrun is the ancestral home of Catelyn's family, and Ned suggests she visit\",83\r\n1393,RIVERRUN,TUMBLESTONE,Riverrun is strategically located near the Tumblestone river,32\r\n1457,HOSTER TULLY,EDMURE TULLY,Edmure Tully is the son of Hoster Tully,31\r\n1459,EDMURE TULLY,JONOS BRACKEN,Jonos Bracken is a bannerman of House Tully,29\r\n835,RED FORK,EDMURE TULLY,Edmure Tully dispersed men to guard holdfasts along the Red Fork,26\r\n4048,BLACKFISH,GAWEN WESTERLING,Gawen Westerling's family is held captive by the Blackfish,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
