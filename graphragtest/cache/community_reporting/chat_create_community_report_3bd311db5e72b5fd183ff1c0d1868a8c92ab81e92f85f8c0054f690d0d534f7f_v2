He returns to Winterfell with a prisoner named Reek, expressing concerns about the legitimacy of Ramsay Snow’s marriage to Lady Hornwood. His actions demonstrate his commitment to upholding justice and protecting the interests of House Stark.\n\nDespite his efforts, Ser Rodrik Cassel meets a tragic end during the Sack of Winterfell, where he is murdered by Ramsay Bolton. His death marks a significant loss for House Stark, as he was a steadfast bannerman and a key figure in the defense of their stronghold. Earlier in his service, he had also disarmed Ned Stark’s suspicions by appearing at a brothel, showcasing his resourcefulness and dedication to his duties.\n\nThroughout his life, Ser Rodrik Cassel remains a symbol of loyalty and valor, embodying the ideals of House Stark until his untimely demise. His legacy is remembered as that of a devoted knight who fought tirelessly for his family and their cause.\",12\r\n1036,REEK,\"Reek is a complex and multifaceted character in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, primarily associated with Ramsay Snow (later Ramsay Bolton) and Theon Greyjoy. Initially introduced as a cruel and unkempt servant of Ramsay Snow, Reek is known for his lack of hygiene and cunning nature. He is literate and offers to assist Theon Greyjoy, contrasting sharply with Theon’s diminished state under Ramsay’s control. Reek is also involved in the forced marriage and subsequent murder of Lady Hornwood, showcasing his role as an enforcer of Ramsay’s will.\n\nLater, it is revealed that Reek is not merely a servant but an alias for Theon Greyjoy himself, who has been psychologically and physically broken by Ramsay Bolton. In this degraded state, Theon adopts the identity of Reek, viewing Ramsay as a merciful master despite the horrors inflicted upon him. This transformation underscores the depth of Theon’s torment and Ramsay’s manipulative cruelty.\n\nReek’s history includes serving Ramsay Snow and being brought to Winterfell by Ser Rodrik Cassel, where he plays a role in the sack of the castle. He is also involved in the deception surrounding the deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, further entangling him in the brutal politics of the North. His character serves as a stark contrast to Theon’s former self, illustrating the devastating consequences of betrayal and torture.\n\nUltimately, Reek embodies both a servant and a victim, reflecting the duality of his existence under Ramsay’s control.

Her fate takes a dark turn when she attempts to escape with another individual named Reek, only to suffer a brutal end at the hands of Ramsay’s dogs.

Reek murdered Gelmarr to prevent him from revealing secrets, likely pertaining to Theon's actions or the ironborn's plans. This act underscores the brutal and treacherous environment of the time, where betrayal and violence were commonplace. Gelmarr's death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers faced by those entangled in the power struggles of Westeros, particularly under the manipulative and ruthless Ramsay Bolton. His brief but notable presence in the narrative highlights the expendable nature of even loyal followers in the cutthroat world of the ironborn and their enemies.\",1\r\n1418,AGGAR,\"AGGAR is a character associated with the Ironborn in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series.

This act underscores the ruthless and treacherous environment within the Ironborn ranks, as well as the lengths to which Reek would go to maintain control and silence potential threats.
