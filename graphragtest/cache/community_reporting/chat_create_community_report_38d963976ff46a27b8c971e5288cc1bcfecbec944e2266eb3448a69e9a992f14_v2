A key leader in Robert’s Rebellion, he overthrew the Targaryen dynasty and ascended to the throne. Known for his love of hunting, war, and revelry, Robert was a charismatic but flawed ruler, often neglecting governance in favor of indulgence. His reign was marked by infidelity, fathering multiple bastards, including Edric Storm, whose existence strained his marriage to Cersei Lannister. Despite his personal failings, Robert maintained a close friendship with Eddard Stark, whom he appointed Hand of the King.\n\nRobert’s relationship with Cersei was fraught with tension, and his death—caused by a boar during a hunt—sparked a succession crisis, leading to Joffrey’s rise and the War of the Five Kings. His final moments were spent entrusting Ned with the care of his children and expressing regret for his past actions. Robert’s death also triggered Cersei’s purge of his bastards, further destabilizing the realm.\n\nBeyond his political role, Robert was remembered for his physical resemblance to his younger brother Renly and his strained relationship with Stannis, whom he often overlooked. His rule was criticized by figures like Pycelle, who deemed him unfit, and his legacy was marred by rumors and contradictions. Robert’s influence extended to Winterfell, where he visited and interacted with the Stark family, and his decisions, such as ordering the execution of Sansa’s direwolf, Lady, reflected his authority.\n\nIn contrast, **Robert Arryn**, Lysa Arryn’s sickly young son, is a separate figure often confused with Robert Baratheon. A fragile boy prone to seizures, Robert Arryn was deeply dependent on his mother and was present during key events, such as the trial by combat at the Eyrie. Lysa sought to marry him to Sansa Stark, highlighting his role in the political machinations of the Vale.\n\nRobert Baratheon’s complex legacy—marked by rebellion, rule, and personal turmoil—left an indelible impact on Westeros, shaping the conflicts that followed his death.\",41\r\n401,BARRA,Robert Baratheon's bastard daughter living at Chataya's brothel,2\r\n144,BARROWLANDS,The Barrowlands is a region where Ned and Robert ride through,1\r\n201,SER ARON SANTAGAR,\"Ser Aron Santagar is a knight and the master-at-arms of the Red Keep.
