As the daughter of Balon Greyjoy, she is a claimant to the throne and a formidable leader who commands both ships and men. Asha has earned her father’s trust and has proven herself as a capable commander, leading forces on the Iron Islands and beyond.\n\nAsha is also the sister of Theon Greyjoy, with whom she shares a complex relationship. She often berates Theon for his actions, criticizing his decisions and humiliating him on occasion, such as when she disguises herself as Esgred to test him and later mocks him at a feast. Despite their strained relationship, she remains a significant figure in his life, even leaving Winterfell after confronting him.\n\nAs a claimant to the kingsmoot, Asha offers a vision of peace with the Northmen, distinguishing herself from other contenders like Euron Greyjoy, whose claims she reacts to with skepticism or opposition. She is also recognized for her past romantic involvement with Tristifer Botley, though she now refuses his advances, asserting that they are no longer children.\n\nAsha’s leadership extends beyond the Iron Islands, as she has fled the region with loyal followers and is currently at Deepwood Motte. Her strategic movements and alliances suggest she is a shrewd and adaptable leader, navigating the treacherous political landscape with determination.

However, their relationships with other groups are complex and often fraught with tension, particularly with House Frey, with whom they share a history of conflict and animosity. Additionally, the Northmen have been known to take harsh actions against those they perceive as enemies or traitors, including instances where they killed tavern wenches for servicing Lannister men, reflecting their deep-seated loyalty to their own people and their disdain for their adversaries.

During this time, Asha Greyjoy and her men are stationed at the castle, either as occupants or captives, depending on the shifting dynamics of the conflict. Stannis ultimately captures Asha at Deepwood Motte, using the location as a key point in his military operations. Additionally, it is at Deepwood Motte that Stannis receives warnings about Arnolf Karstark’s treachery, further complicating the political landscape.\n\nThe castle is also a focal point in discussions among key figures.
