A mentor and foster father to both Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, he played a crucial role in shaping their lives and the political landscape of the Seven Kingdoms. Jon Arryn was instrumental in ending Robert’s Rebellion, fighting at the Trident, and later helping to negotiate an end to a conspiracy involving House Martell. He was also known for his role in recommending Cersei Lannister as Robert’s wife, though this decision later contributed to his downfall.\n\nJon Arryn’s death was shrouded in mystery and intrigue, becoming a central event in the political conflicts that followed. Initially, his death was attributed to natural causes, but it was later revealed that he was poisoned by Cersei Lannister after discovering her incestuous relationship with Jaime and the true lineage of her children. His investigations into Robert’s bastards, particularly Gendry, and his suspicions about Cersei’s secrets are believed to have led to his murder. Littlefinger, who was deeply involved in the conspiracy, orchestrated the poisoning with Lysa Arryn’s unwitting assistance, further complicating the political fallout.\n\nJon Arryn’s death sparked unrest in the Vale and beyond, as his lineage and the question of succession became critical. His son, Robin Arryn, was considered for the position of Warden of the East, though Lysa’s overprotective nature and political maneuvering complicated matters. Ned Stark, Jon Arryn’s foster son, took up the investigation into his death, uncovering the truth about Cersei’s treachery and the broader conspiracy that threatened the realm. Jon Arryn’s legacy is marked by his loyalty, his role in shaping the kingdom’s leadership, and the tragic circumstances of his death, which set in motion a chain of events leading to war and political upheaval. His memory is invoked in discussions of loyalty, treason, and the cost of power, making him a pivotal figure in the history of Westeros.\",27\r\n337,TEARS OF LYS,\"\"\"Tears of Lys\"\" is a rare and deadly poison with a notable history in the world of Westeros. It was famously used by Lysa Arryn to kill her husband, Jon Arryn, under the manipulation of Petyr Baelish, also known as Littlefinger. This act played a crucial role in the political intrigue that sparked the events of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. Additionally, \"\"Tears of Lys\"\" is a poison taught to Arya Stark by the Waif during her training with the Faceless Men in Braavos, highlighting its significance in the shadowy arts of assassination. The poison is known for its potency and lethality, making it a feared tool among those who wield it. Its use in high-profile killings underscores its reputation as a weapon of choice for those seeking a swift and untraceable death.\",3\r\n263,KING ROBERT BARATHEON,\"King Robert Baratheon was the deceased ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, whose death precipitated a devastating civil war. As the former king, his reign marked a significant era in the history of Westeros, though his passing left a power vacuum that plunged the realm into chaos. Robert Baratheon is also notably referenced in the final words of Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, whose mysterious death and cryptic last message hinted at deeper political intrigues surrounding the monarchy. His legacy, therefore, is intertwined with both the stability he once maintained and the turmoil that followed his demise.\",1\r\n289,LORD STANNIS,\"Lord Stannis is a stern and humorless nobleman known for his rigid demeanor and political ambitions.
