He was present at Hoster Tully's funeral, demonstrating his allegiance to the Tully family. As a river lord, Marq Piper has played an active role in the conflict, leading raiding forces that targeted Jaime Lannister’s supply trains, contributing to small but significant victories for the Tully cause. His most notable achievement was commanding a raiding party that ultimately led to the capture of Jaime Lannister, a pivotal moment in the war.\n\nMarq Piper is also recognized for his bold and outspoken nature, particularly in his condemnation of Gregor Clegane, whom he labeled a \"\"false knight,\"\" and Tywin Lannister, whom he referred to as a \"\"mad dog.\"\" These statements reflect his strong sense of honor and disdain for the Lannister forces. Additionally, he was present at key meetings as a representative of House Tully, further solidifying his role as a trusted commander and advisor within the faction. His actions and leadership have made him a notable figure among the river lords, contributing to the broader efforts of House Tully in the war.\",4\r\n30,FAITH OF THE SEVEN,\"The Faith of the Seven is the dominant religion in the realm, characterized by its worship of seven deities. It stands in contrast to the older belief systems, particularly the old gods of the North, which represent a more ancient and regionally rooted tradition. Unlike the old gods, the Faith of the Seven is structured and institutionalized, playing a significant role in the political and social fabric of the realm. One of its distinguishing features is the practice of anointing knights, a ritual that underscores its influence in both spiritual and martial affairs. This religion is widespread and holds considerable power, shaping the cultural and moral values of its adherents. The Faith of the Seven is often depicted as a unifying force, though its dominance is not absolute, as it coexists with—and sometimes opposes—other religious traditions. Its clergy and practices are central to the governance and daily life of many regions, reinforcing its status as a cornerstone of the realm's identity.\",3\r\n239,JORY,\"Jory Cassel was a loyal guardsman and the deceased captain of the guard for Lord Eddard \"\"Ned\"\" Stark of Winterfell. As the son of Martyn Cassel, his death marked the tragic end of his family line. Jory was known for his unwavering dedication to House Stark, serving as one of Ned’s most trusted protectors. He played a notable role in Arya Stark’s life, helping her drive away her direwolf, Nymeria, and keeping the secret of the wolf’s fate to protect Arya from repercussions.\n\nBeyond his duties as a guardsman, Jory was also involved in more covert operations, including searching whorehouses for information, demonstrating his resourcefulness and commitment to his lord’s causes. His life came to a violent end when he was killed while defending Ned Stark, a testament to his loyalty and bravery. Jory’s death was a significant loss to House Stark, as he was not only a skilled warrior but also a symbol of the honor and devotion that defined the Stark household. His legacy endures as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who served the Starks during tumultuous times.\",3\r\n480,KARYL VANCE,\"Lord Karyl Vance is a prominent river lord and a loyal bannerman of House Tully. He is known for his involvement in key events during the War of the Five Kings, including his presence at Hoster Tully's funeral, where he stood as a representative of his house. As a knight and a leader, Karyl Vance has played an active role in the conflict, particularly in raiding Jaime Lannister’s supply trains, which contributed to the disruption of Lannister forces in the Riverlands.\n\nDespite his relatively minor victories, his actions have demonstrated his commitment to the Tully cause.

He is depicted as a member of Ned’s personal guard, accompanying him during his time in King’s Landing. Heward is noted for his interactions with others, including a scene where he is seen gambling with a whore, suggesting a more casual or relaxed demeanor despite his duties.\n\nTragically, Heward meets his end at the hands of Lannister forces. He is killed during the conflict that arises from Ned Stark’s arrest and the subsequent power struggle in the capital. Some accounts specifically mention that he is murdered by Jaime Lannister, known as the Kingslayer, though other descriptions more generally attribute his death to Lannister forces. Regardless of the specifics, Heward’s fate is tied to the broader violence and betrayal that unfolds during this turbulent period.\n\nAs one of Ned Stark’s loyal guardsmen, Heward’s death underscores the brutality and political machinations of the time, reflecting the dangers faced by those aligned with the Starks in their opposition to the Lannisters. His role, though minor, contributes to the narrative of loyalty and loss that permeates the story.\",1\r\n402,WYL,\"WYL was a guardsman serving under Ned Stark, the Warden of the North. As a loyal member of House Stark's household guard, he was tasked with protecting Ned Stark during his time as Hand of the King in King's Landing. Tragically, WYL met his end at the hands of Lannister forces, specifically by the Kingslayer, Jaime Lannister. His death occurred amid the political turmoil and violence that erupted between House Stark and House Lannister. WYL's killing was part of a broader conflict that saw several of Ned Stark's guardsmen slain, reflecting the brutal and unforgiving nature of the power struggle in the capital. His fate underscored the dangers faced by those caught in the crossfire of the Lannisters' ruthless tactics.\",1\r\n436,MARTYN CASSEL,\"Martyn Cassel was a notable companion of Ned Stark at the Tower of Joy, a significant event in the history of Westeros.

Martyn’s lineage concluded with his son, Jory Cassel, as no further descendants carried on the family name. His association with Ned Stark and his presence at the Tower of Joy suggest he played a role in the events surrounding Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, though specific details of his actions remain largely undocumented.
