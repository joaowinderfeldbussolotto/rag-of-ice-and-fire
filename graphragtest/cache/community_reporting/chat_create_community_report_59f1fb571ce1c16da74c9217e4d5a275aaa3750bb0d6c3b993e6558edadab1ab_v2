Catelyn Stark urged Robb to command forces at the fortress and suggested retreating there to meet Lord Tywin Lannister in battle, underscoring its defensive value.\n\nThe fortress has changed hands multiple times, reflecting its contested nature. It was once held by the Ironborn, who occupied it and delayed the transport of Ned Stark’s bones.
