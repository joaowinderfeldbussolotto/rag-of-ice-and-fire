Their actions reflect both their strategic importance and their deep involvement in the broader political landscape of Westeros.\",4\r\n638,LORD WALDER FREY,\"Lord Walder Frey is a 90-year-old nobleman known for his impolite and direct demeanor.

Lord Walder is deeply involved in political maneuvering, particularly in marriage negotiations, as seen in his dealings with Robb Stark, the King in the North.
