As the Lord of Deepwood Motte, he holds significant influence in the region, though he is currently away from his seat, actively engaged in the ongoing conflicts. A staunch supporter of Robb Stark’s cause, Galbart was entrusted with the important task of seeking out Howland Reed, demonstrating Robb’s trust in his abilities and judgment.\n\nDuring a crucial meeting of northern lords, Galbart Glover voiced his support for Stannis Baratheon as a potential king, showcasing his political acumen and willingness to consider strategic alliances for the benefit of the North. Despite his allegiance to Robb, his pragmatic approach suggests a focus on the greater good of his people and the realm.\n\nAdditionally, Galbart Glover is noted for his ownership of the bed where Asha Greyjoy and Qarl the Maid once engaged in intimacy, a detail that adds a layer of personal history to his otherwise martial and political reputation. This anecdote, while seemingly trivial, hints at the interconnected nature of noble houses and their possessions in the broader narrative of the North.\n\nIn summary, Galbart Glover is a respected and active northern lord, deeply involved in the military and political affairs of his time. His loyalty to Robb Stark, his adherence to the old gods, and his role in key decisions underscore his importance in the North’s struggle for independence and stability.\",4\r\n1050,ROBETT GLOVER,\"Robett Glover is a prominent northern lord and commander, known for his military actions during the War of the Five Kings. As a brother of Galbart Glover, he played a significant role in the conflicts of the North. Initially, Robett was ordered to burn Darry and strike east toward Duskendale, leading a force of northmen. During this campaign, he marched on Duskendale alongside Helman Tallhart, but their forces were ultimately captured by the Bloody Mummers, a brutal mercenary group.\n\nDespite his capture, Robett Glover later found himself in Duskendale as part of an agreement, where he was put on a ship, possibly as a prisoner or under negotiated terms. His movements became erratic as he fled west, pursued by the infamous Gregor Clegane, a feared warrior known for his brutality. This flight suggests a desperate attempt to evade capture or death at the hands of his enemies.\n\nIn addition to his military exploits, Robett Glover is noted for his involvement in more covert activities. He is known to have led Davos Seaworth through secret hallways, indicating his familiarity with hidden passages and possibly his role in strategic or clandestine operations. His actions reflect both his leadership in battle and his resourcefulness in navigating dangerous political and military landscapes.\n\nRobett Glover’s story is one of resilience and adaptability, marked by both triumphs and setbacks. His capture by the Bloody Mummers and subsequent escape or transfer to Duskendale highlight the perilous nature of his endeavors. As a lord commander of the northmen, his actions were crucial in the broader conflicts of the North, and his legacy is intertwined with the fate of his house and allies.\",7\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1456,GALBART GLOVER,ROBB STARK,Galbart Glover is a northern lord supporting Robb Stark,86\r\n3121,ROBETT GLOVER,GREGOR CLEGANE,Robett Glover is being chased by Gregor Clegane,38\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
