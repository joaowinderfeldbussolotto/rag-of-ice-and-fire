His actions demonstrate his commitment to upholding justice and protecting the interests of House Stark.\n\nDespite his efforts, Ser Rodrik Cassel meets a tragic end during the Sack of Winterfell, where he is murdered by Ramsay Bolton. His death marks a significant loss for House Stark, as he was a steadfast bannerman and a key figure in the defense of their stronghold. Earlier in his service, he had also disarmed Ned Stark’s suspicions by appearing at a brothel, showcasing his resourcefulness and dedication to his duties.\n\nThroughout his life, Ser Rodrik Cassel remains a symbol of loyalty and valor, embodying the ideals of House Stark until his untimely demise.

He is literate and offers to assist Theon Greyjoy, contrasting sharply with Theon’s diminished state under Ramsay’s control. Reek is also involved in the forced marriage and subsequent murder of Lady Hornwood, showcasing his role as an enforcer of Ramsay’s will.\n\nLater, it is revealed that Reek is not merely a servant but an alias for Theon Greyjoy himself, who has been psychologically and physically broken by Ramsay Bolton. In this degraded state, Theon adopts the identity of Reek, viewing Ramsay as a merciful master despite the horrors inflicted upon him. This transformation underscores the depth of Theon’s torment and Ramsay’s manipulative cruelty.\n\nReek’s history includes serving Ramsay Snow and being brought to Winterfell by Ser Rodrik Cassel, where he plays a role in the sack of the castle. He is also involved in the deception surrounding the deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, further entangling him in the brutal politics of the North. His character serves as a stark contrast to Theon’s former self, illustrating the devastating consequences of betrayal and torture.\n\nUltimately, Reek embodies both a servant and a victim, reflecting the duality of his existence under Ramsay’s control.

He is known for massing men at the Dreadfort, consolidating his influence and preparing for conflict.\n\nRamsay is infamous for his involvement in the murder of Lady Hornwood, whom he forcibly married before her death. His actions led to his eventual capture and execution by Rodrik's men, though his legacy of violence persisted. Despite his bastard status, he was later legitimized as Ramsay Bolton, further solidifying his position within House Bolton. However, he remains a divisive figure, often excluded from key discussions and meetings due to his illegitimate birth and notorious reputation.\n\nHis ambitions extend to seizing the Hornwood lands, demonstrating his desire to expand his power and control. Ramsay’s betrayal of Theon Greyjoy highlights his opportunistic and treacherous nature, as he prioritizes his own interests over alliances. His life is a testament to the brutal and unforgiving world of Westeros, where power is often seized through violence and deceit.

Reek murdered Gelmarr to prevent him from revealing secrets, likely pertaining to Theon's actions or the ironborn's plans. This act underscores the brutal and treacherous environment of the time, where betrayal and violence were commonplace. Gelmarr's death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers faced by those entangled in the power struggles of Westeros, particularly under the manipulative and ruthless Ramsay Bolton.
