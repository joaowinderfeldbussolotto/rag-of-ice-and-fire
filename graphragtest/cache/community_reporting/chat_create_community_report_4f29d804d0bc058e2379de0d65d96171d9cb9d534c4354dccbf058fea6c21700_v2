Known for his considerable size, he is often described as too fat to ride a horse, a detail that has led some, including Stannis Baratheon, to dismiss him as ineffective. Despite this, he remains a powerful and influential northern lord with a complex and often contentious relationship with House Bolton.\n\nManderly is a key player in the political tensions of the North, particularly at Winterfell. He is blamed by Ser Hosteen Frey and Aenys Frey for the deaths of their kin, a grievance that escalates into a violent confrontation when Hosteen insults him. His actions and alliances are carefully calculated, reflecting his deep involvement in the region's power struggles.\n\nThough he pledged allegiance to King Tommen Baratheon, his loyalties are not absolute. He resists allying with Stannis Baratheon, despite being seen as a potential ally, and engages in strategic discussions, such as fleet-building with Bran Stark. His political maneuvering is further evidenced by his attendance at significant events, including a wedding and a feast where he dances with Beth Cassel.\n\nManderly also demonstrates his influence through practical actions, such as sending barges upriver and dispatching his sons to accompany Catelyn Stark. His interactions with figures like Davos Seaworth highlight his role as a cautious yet significant player in the broader conflicts of Westeros. Despite his physical limitations, Lord Wyman Manderly remains a formidable and shrewd leader, navigating the treacherous waters of northern politics with a blend of diplomacy and force.\",20\r\n596,WHITE HARBOR,\"White Harbor is a prominent port city in the North of Westeros, serving as the seat of House Manderly and ruled by Lord Wyman Manderly. As a key location within the Stark lands, it plays a significant role in the political and military affairs of the region. The city is fortified and strategically important, attracting the attention of figures like Stannis Baratheon, who considers seizing it for its resources.\n\nDavos Seaworth is closely tied to White Harbor, as he is ordered to sail there to post Stannis’s declaration. Upon arrival, he observes the Lionstar warship and is later held captive in the New Castle, where political intrigue unfolds. His journey to the city aboard the *Merry Midwife* underscores its importance as a destination in the broader conflicts of Westeros.\n\nWhite Harbor is also a potential refuge for Osha, who plans to take Rickon Stark and Shaggydog there, highlighting its role as a place of safety or strategic movement. The city is known for its maritime contributions, as Lord Wyman Manderly brings seafood from White Harbor to feasts, showcasing its economic and cultural significance.\n\nThe Manderly family’s influence is deeply tied to the city, as it is their ancestral home and the site of conflicts involving their forces. White Harbor’s combination of political, military, and economic importance makes it a pivotal location in the North, intertwined with the fates of major characters and houses in the region.\",4\r\n2384,SER HOSTEEN,A lord in Winterfell who quarrels with Aenys Frey over the deaths of their kin,2\r\n2287,THEOMORE,\"Maester of the Manderlys, distrusted due to Lannister ties\",1\r\n1405,AENYS FREY,\"Aenys Frey is a notable member of House Frey, a prominent family in the fictional world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*.

As a lord in Winterfell, Aenys Frey finds himself embroiled in tensions when his squire is discovered dead, a situation that exacerbates existing conflicts in the region. This event underscores the volatile and dangerous environment of Winterfell during this period.\n\nAdditionally, Aenys Frey is depicted as a man distressed by the disappearance of other Frey men, suggesting a sense of loyalty or concern for his kin. His emotional state reflects the broader instability and peril faced by House Frey, particularly in the wake of the Red Wedding and its aftermath. Furthermore, Aenys Frey is captured by the Bloody Mummers, a brutal mercenary group, and brought to Harrenhal, a fortress with a dark reputation. This capture highlights the precarious position of the Freys and the ever-present threat of violence in the world of Westeros.\n\nOverall, Aenys Frey’s character is marked by his involvement in key political and military events, his connections to House Frey, and his experiences of loss and captivity, all of which contribute to the intricate and often treacherous narrative of the series.\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2227,LORD WYMAN MANDERLY,BRAN STARK,\"Lord Wyman Manderly attends the feast and brings gifts, interacting with Bran Stark\",61\r\n2052,WYMAN MANDERLY,WHITE HARBOR,\"Wyman Manderly is the Lord of White Harbor, a prominent city in the North of Westeros.
