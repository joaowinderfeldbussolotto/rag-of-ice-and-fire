He is the son of Cersei Lannister and, officially, Robert Baratheon, though his legitimacy is questioned by Stannis Baratheon. As Joffrey Baratheon’s younger brother and heir, Tommen inherits the Iron Throne, though his reign is marked by manipulation and external control. He is also the brother of Myrcella Baratheon, with whom he shares a close bond, and is noted for his kindness and bravery, contrasting with his brother Joffrey’s cruelty.\n\nTommen’s rule is heavily influenced by his mother, Cersei, and other powerful figures, including his advisors and later his wife, Margaery Tyrell. Despite his youth, he is eager to participate in royal duties, such as signing papers in the Small Council and continuing his training as a ruler. However, his reign is fraught with challenges, as he is often controlled by evil councillors and political schemes, including Littlefinger’s plan to marry him to Arya Stark for political gain.\n\nHis personal struggles are evident in his interactions with his family and advisors. He is deeply affected by the pressures of kingship, even falling ill from the stress of public mourning and being consoled by Jaime Lannister, who also advises him. Tommen’s vulnerability is further highlighted when he is hidden at Rosby under the care of Lord Gyles for protection, and his eventual loss of the Iron Throne underscores the instability of his rule.\n\nDespite his youth and the challenges he faces, Tommen remains a sympathetic figure, striving to fulfill his duties while navigating the treacherous political landscape of Westeros. His marriage to Margaery Tyrell and his interactions with key figures like Jaime and Cersei shape his reign, reflecting both his potential and the limitations imposed by those around him.\",14\r\n544,THE QUEEN,\"The Queen, a central figure of authority in the story, is prominently featured in the context of Tyrion Lannister’s recovery and the unfolding political intrigue. She is depicted as a powerful ruler who issues commands and confronts Tyrion regarding his relationship with Shae, suggesting a personal and political vendetta. While initially unnamed, the descriptions strongly imply that the Queen is Cersei Lannister, a well-known antagonist in the narrative. Cersei, as the queen, is characterized by her manipulative and authoritative nature, often making decisive moves to secure her power and protect her interests.\n\nOne of her key actions involves plans to hide her son, Tommen, at Rosby, likely as a strategic measure to ensure his safety or to consolidate her control over the realm. This decision underscores her calculating and protective instincts, particularly concerning her family. The Queen’s interactions with Tyrion further highlight her antagonistic role, as she challenges him over his past actions and alliances, reinforcing her position as a formidable and often ruthless leader.\n\nOverall, the Queen—identified as Cersei Lannister—embodies a complex blend of authority, cunning, and maternal protectiveness, making her a pivotal and contentious figure in the story. Her actions and motivations drive significant plot developments, particularly in relation to Tyrion and the broader political landscape.\",2\r\n1395,ROSBY,\"Rosby is a notable location in the realm, serving multiple significant roles. It is situated along a road where Brienne of Tarth encounters hedge knights during her travels, marking it as a point of interest for those journeying through the area. Additionally, Rosby is known for its dungeon, where Boros Blount, a knight of the Kingsguard, is imprisoned, suggesting its use as a place of confinement for notable figures. Furthermore, Rosby is designated as a refuge for King Tommen Baratheon, who is to be hidden there under the care of Lord Gyles Rosby, indicating its strategic importance in matters of royal protection and secrecy.
