Enclosed by a great wall and defended by hundreds of guards, the city is a key location for significant political and military events. Daenerys faces numerous internal conflicts and external threats, including a siege by Yunkish forces, who aim to starve the city into submission through famine and disease. During the siege, trebuchets are used to fling corpses over the walls, adding to the city's turmoil.\n\nMeereen is a hub of political intrigue, with figures like Barristan Selmy and Hizdahr zo Loraq playing crucial roles in navigating the city's crises. The Harpy's Sons, a resistance group, commit murders, including attacks on the Unsullied, Daenerys' elite guard. The city is also a cultural center, hosting events such as the fighting pits, where Daenerys interacts with local traditions. Additionally, she visits sick Astapori refugees who have fled to Meereen, highlighting the city's role as a refuge.\n\nThe city is a destination for various characters, including Quentyn Martell, who seeks to reach it despite the dangers, and Victarion Greyjoy, who travels there with his own ambitions. Meereen is also a place of commerce, where Dothraki captives are sold for gold, and where Daenerys hosts influential figures like Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The presence of her dragons and the Unsullied further underscores the city's strategic and symbolic importance.\n\nUnder Daenerys' rule, Meereen becomes a focal point of power struggles, social tensions, and military conflicts, making it a central location in the broader narrative of Slaver's Bay. Despite the challenges, Daenerys remains in the city, dealing with its complex political and military landscape rather than marching out to new conquests.\",12\r\n986,PONO,\"PONO is a Khal who leads a khalasar, a group of Dothraki warriors, as they approach the city of Volantis. As a prominent figure within Daenerys Targaryen’s faction, PONO is known for his strategic and assertive leadership. Notably, he secured the best mounts for himself and his followers, leaving others in the group with weaker horses. This action highlights his prioritization of strength and advantage, reinforcing his position as a formidable leader within the khalasar. His role and decisions reflect both his authority and his alignment with Daenerys’ broader ambitions, as he navigates the challenges and dynamics of leading a warrior group in a volatile region.\",2\r\n1519,GROLEO,\"Groleo was an admiral in Daenerys Targaryen's fleet, serving as both a military advisor and a captain of a ship under her command. Known for his strategic counsel, he played a significant role in advising Daenerys on naval and military matters during her campaigns. At one point, Groleo was offered as a hostage to the Yunkai'i, a faction opposing Daenerys, in an attempt to secure a truce or negotiate terms. However, this gesture ultimately failed, as the Yunkai'i severed his head and presented it to Daenerys' forces as a brutal act of intimidation. His death was later used as a code word in Daenerys' military plans, symbolizing a pivotal moment in her campaign against Yunkai. Groleo's fate underscored the ruthlessness of the conflict and the high stakes of Daenerys' conquest. Despite his tragic end, his contributions as an admiral and advisor remained notable in her strategic endeavors.\",2\r\n1650,YUNKAI,\"Yunkai is a prominent city-state in Slaver's Bay, known for its complex and often hostile relations with neighboring cities and Daenerys Targaryen. Initially cowed by Daenerys during her campaign to abolish slavery, Yunkai later resumed the practice after her departure, becoming a persistent threat to the anti-slavery reforms in Meereen and Astapor. The city has been deeply involved in regional conflicts, notably allying with sellsword companies, including the Windblown, to oppose Daenerys and her allies.\n\nYunkai played a significant role in the war against Astapor and Meereen, spreading propaganda against Daenerys and her rule. At one point, it found itself under siege by Daenerys and her forces, defended by mercenary companies it had hired. Despite its aggressive stance, Yunkai has also engaged in negotiations, sending envoys to Meereen to demand the destruction of Daenerys' dragons in exchange for hostages, showcasing its strategic and diplomatic maneuvering.\n\nThe city-state has been a key player in the broader conflict in Slaver's Bay, massing ships and constructing siege weapons to attack Meereen, further escalating tensions. Its alliances with sellsword companies have reinforced its military capabilities, allowing it to sustain prolonged sieges and threats against its rivals. Yunkai's actions reflect its determination to resist Daenerys' influence and restore its autonomy, even as it navigates shifting alliances and military strategies in the region.\",10\r\n2158,REZNAK MO REZNAK,\"Reznak mo Reznak is a prominent political figure in Meereen, serving as a court advisor and seneschal with significant influence in the city's governance and political affairs. Initially, he holds the position of seneschal under Hizdahr zo Loraq, where he plays a key role in delivering messages and facilitating communication, including interactions with Ser Barristan Selmy. His deep involvement in Meereenese traditions and customs further solidifies his standing as a knowledgeable and respected official within the city's political structure.\n\nLater, Reznak transitions into serving Daenerys Targaryen as her seneschal, assisting her in governance and court matters. Despite his administrative competence, he becomes a figure of suspicion when Daenerys begins to question his loyalty, suspecting him of being a traitor. His dual roles under both Hizdahr and Daenerys place him at the center of Meereen's shifting political landscape, where his actions and allegiances are closely scrutinized. Reznak's influence and involvement in key affairs make him a pivotal, if controversial, figure in the governance of Meereen.\",3\r\n1516,ASTAPOR,\"Astapor is a prominent city in Slaver's Bay, known for its role in the slave trade, particularly as a center where the Unsullied, elite warrior-eunuchs, are trained and sold. The city was conquered by Daenerys Targaryen and her followers after she negotiated the purchase of the Unsullied, only to later free them and overthrow the ruling slavers. This act of liberation marked a significant turning point in Daenerys' campaign against slavery in the region.\n\nFollowing its fall, Astapor became a site of ongoing conflict and instability. The city was ruled by Cleon, a former slave who rose to power after Daenerys' departure, and sought alliances with Meereen against Yunkai, another rival city in Slaver's Bay. However, Astapor's struggles continued, culminating in its eventual downfall, with the city burning and its refugees fleeing to Meereen for safety.\n\nAstapor's history is deeply intertwined with Daenerys' actions, as it was here that she first demonstrated her resolve to dismantle the slave trade, despite initially viewing the Unsullied as a useful military asset. The city also became a strategic point of contention among the cities of Slaver's Bay, with Yunkai and Meereen playing key roles in its fate. Additionally, Astapor is noted as a location where the Windblown, a mercenary company, are currently stationed, further complicating the region's volatile political landscape.\n\nIn summary, Astapor is a city defined by its past as a slave-trading hub, its liberation by Daenerys, and its subsequent struggles under new leadership, ultimately leading to its destruction and the displacement of its people.\",9\r\n2274,COMPANY OF THE CAT,\"The Company of the Cat is a sellsword company led by Bloodbeard, known for its military services and alliances. Operating under Bloodbeard's command, the group is closely affiliated with the city of Yunkai, providing its martial expertise in exchange for patronage. As a sellsword company, the Company of the Cat is composed of skilled mercenaries who offer their combat prowess to the highest bidder, though their current allegiance lies firmly with Yunkai. Their reputation is built on their effectiveness in battle and their loyalty to their employer, making them a formidable force in the region. The company's name and leadership under Bloodbeard distinguish them among other mercenary groups, reinforcing their identity as a key military asset for Yunkai.\",2\r\n2161,HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ,\"Hizdahr zo Loraq is a prominent nobleman from Meereen, known for his political acumen and wealth. As a key political figure, he plays a significant role in the city's governance, particularly during Daenerys Targaryen's rule. Hizdahr is a strong advocate for the reopening of the fighting pits, a traditional and culturally significant institution in Meereen, which he believes will help restore order and appease the populace.\n\nIn his efforts to stabilize Meereen, Hizdahr arranges a feast and peace negotiations with the Yunkish, demonstrating his diplomatic skills in navigating the complex political tensions between Meereen and its adversaries, including Yunkai. His political maneuvering also involves sidelining influential figures such as Ser Barristan Selmy, reflecting his strategic approach to consolidating power and influence.\n\nHizdahr is proposed as a suitor to Daenerys Targaryen as part of a political strategy to end the attacks by the Harpy's Sons, a resistance group opposing her rule. Despite Daenerys initially refusing other suitors, such as Quentyn Martell, she ultimately agrees to marry Hizdahr, recognizing the potential benefits of the alliance for Meereen's stability. Their marriage solidifies his position as a central figure in the city's leadership, and he eventually becomes the king of Meereen, tasked with managing the delicate balance of power among various factions.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Hizdahr zo Loraq remains a controversial yet pivotal figure, balancing tradition and political necessity in his efforts to govern Meereen and secure its future. His actions reflect both his commitment to his city and his willingness to engage in complex negotiations to achieve peace and stability.\",9\r\n2210,HARPY'S SONS,\"The Harpy’s Sons are a clandestine group operating in Meereen, known for their violent opposition to Daenerys Targaryen’s rule. They are responsible for numerous attacks, murders, and acts of sabotage within the city, including the killing of Mossador, a follower of Daenerys. Their actions are driven by resistance to her authority and the societal changes she seeks to impose. Hizdahr zo Loraq, a prominent Meereenese noble, has publicly pledged to halt the Harpy’s Sons' activities, suggesting their influence or operations may be tied to factions within Meereen’s political elite. Despite these promises, the group remains a persistent and destabilizing force, undermining Daenerys’ efforts to govern and maintain order in the city. Their name and methods evoke the symbolism of the harpy, a mythical creature associated with vengeance and retribution, reflecting their role as a shadowy, vengeful opposition to the new regime.\",3\r\n2277,BLOODY FLUX,\"**Summary of the Bloody Flux**\n\nThe Bloody Flux is a severe and contagious disease that has significantly impacted various groups and individuals in the regions of Meereen and Astapor. It is notably associated with the survivors of Astapor, particularly the Astapori, who are known to carry and spread the illness. The disease has affected both the Meereenese and Yunkish forces, as well as characters within the Yunkish camp, indicating its widespread and devastating reach.\n\nAmong those afflicted by the Bloody Flux are Nurse and Yezzan, highlighting that the disease does not discriminate between military personnel and civilians. Additionally, there is speculation that Penny, another character in the narrative, may have contracted the illness, further emphasizing its pervasive nature.\n\nThe Bloody Flux appears to thrive in the harsh conditions of the region, spreading rapidly among the vulnerable populations, including soldiers and survivors. Its presence has likely contributed to the weakening of both the Meereenese and Yunkish forces, exacerbating the already tense and conflict-ridden environment. The disease’s impact on key figures and groups underscores its role as a significant factor in the unfolding events in and around Meereen and Astapor.\",3\r\n2234,LORD GHAEL,Envoy from Astapor pleading for Daenerys' help,2\r\n2296,THE FALL OF ASTAPOR,The collapse of Astapor due to siege and disease,1\r\n2445,DAENERYS TARGAREN,\"A prominent figure whose absence is causing unrest in Meereen, with various factions vying for influence in her stead\",1\r\n781,VOLANTIS,\"Volantis is a prominent city-state in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, playing a significant role in the political and military conflicts surrounding Daenerys Targaryen. The city is deeply involved in the power struggles of Slaver’s Bay, with Yunkai influencing its actions against Daenerys. As tensions rise, Volantis dispatches a fleet to Meereen, signaling its intent to intervene in the ongoing conflict, with its arrival eagerly anticipated by various factions.\n\nThe city serves as a crucial meeting point for key figures, including Daenerys, who is expected to encounter Tyrion Lannister and Griff (Jon Connington) there. Additionally, Volantis is where Tyrion and Jorah Mormont arrive, further entangling the city in the broader narrative of exile, intrigue, and shifting alliances. The Golden Company, a famed mercenary group, is also mentioned in connection with Volantis, hinting at its role in the unfolding military strategies.\n\nHistorically, Volantis holds significance as the place where Steffon Baratheon found the fool Patchface while on a mission to secure a bride for Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. More recently, Quentyn Martell and his companions attempted to book passage to Meereen from Volantis, underscoring its importance as a hub for travel and political maneuvering.\n\nAs a powerful and independent city-state, Volantis wields considerable influence, both economically and militarily. Its actions—whether aligning with or opposing Daenerys—have far-reaching consequences for the balance of power in Essos. The city’s fleet, its political machinations, and its role as a crossroads for exiles and mercenaries make it a pivotal location in the broader conflict.\",4\r\n2404,BLOODBEARD,\"Bloodbeard is a sellsword captain representing Yunkai and is closely associated with the Company of the Cat, a mercenary group serving the city. Known for his intimidating presence and involvement in violent tactics, he plays a significant role in the political and military tensions in Meereen.

Daenerys Targaryen, a key figure in the region, plays a significant role in its political and social transformation. Initially, Daenerys seeks to claim Meereen with her army, aiming to dismantle the slave trade that defines the city. However, her approach evolves as she conquers Meereen and establishes herself as its ruler.\n\nAfter taking control, Daenerys rules Meereen and focuses on negotiating peace and resolving conflicts within the city.
