A skilled military leader, Robb achieves significant victories, including outmaneuvering Tywin Lannisterâ€™s forces and securing a triumph at Riverrun. He is known for his strategic prowess, leading armored horse columns and advancing south with his host, though this weakens Winterfellâ€™s defenses.\n\nRobb plays a crucial role in political and military negotiations, sending peace terms to the Lannisters and proposing alliances, such as offering Balon Greyjoy a crown in exchange for attacking the westerlands.
