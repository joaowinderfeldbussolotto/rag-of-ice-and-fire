One notable aspect of the battle is the confrontation between Stannis Baratheon's forces and the defenders of King's Landing, where many of Stannis's bannermen were captured and ultimately bent the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon, swearing allegiance to him after their defeat. This marked a turning point in Stannis's campaign, as his army suffered heavy losses and his support dwindled.\n\nAdditionally, The Battle encompasses a separate but related conflict between the Brotherhood Without Banners, a vigilante group opposing the Lannister regime, and the Bloody Mummers, a brutal mercenary company allied with the Lannisters. This skirmish took place at a septry, highlighting the broader chaos and violence spreading across the realm during the war. The Brotherhood Without Banners, led by figures like Beric Dondarrion, sought to protect the smallfolk and resist the tyranny of the ruling forces, while the Bloody Mummers, under the command of Vargo Hoat, were known for their ruthless tactics.\n\nThe Battle thus represents a series of interconnected struggles, illustrating the fractured loyalties and shifting power dynamics of the era. Stannis's failed assault on King's Landing weakened his claim to the Iron Throne, while the clash between the Brotherhood and the Bloody Mummers underscored the lawlessness and brutality of the conflict.
