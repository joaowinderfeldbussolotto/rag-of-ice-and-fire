Known for its precarious and mountainous location, it is a place of both strategic importance and isolation. The fortress is famously associated with Lysa Arryn, who retreated there following the death of her husband, Jon Arryn, believing it to be a safe haven for herself and her son, Robin Arryn.\n\nThe Eyrie is also notable for its role in the political and personal affairs of key characters in Westeros. It was here that Tyrion Lannister was once held captive, and where Lysa Arryn initially planned to wed Petyr Baelish. Additionally, the fortress is mentioned as a gift intended for Sansa Stark, who, upon awakening there, found it snowing and began sculpting a snow replica of Winterfell, reflecting her longing for home.\n\nBeyond its political significance, the Eyrie is a place of refuge and power. After her husband's death, Lysa Arryn ruled from this stronghold, surrounded by her loyal guards. The fortress also served as a location where Lysa and her guards were taken back following certain events, reinforcing its role as a central hub for House Arryn’s authority.\n\nIn summary, the Eyrie stands as a symbol of House Arryn’s legacy—a mountainous fortress that has witnessed pivotal moments in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors, from Lysa Arryn’s reign to Sansa Stark’s brief stay. Its imposing location and historical significance make it one of the most notable strongholds in the Vale.\",7\r\n90,LYSA,\"**Summary of Lysa Arryn (LYSA):**\n\nLysa Arryn, commonly referred to as Lysa, is the sister of Catelyn Stark and a prominent noblewoman from House Arryn. She is the widow of Jon Arryn, the former Hand of the King, and rules the Eyrie as the Lady of the Vale. After Jon Arryn’s death, Lysa became deeply suspicious of its circumstances, believing it was not natural and accusing Cersei Lannister of orchestrating his murder. Her suspicions were further fueled by her own investigations, leading her to send a secret letter to Catelyn that revealed the truth behind Jon Arryn’s death, setting off a chain of political events.\n\nLysa is known for her volatile and fearful nature, often refusing to leave the safety of the Eyrie, even to visit her ailing father, Hoster Tully. She is described as a plump and well-rested woman, contrasting with her more resilient sister, Catelyn. Lysa’s rule over the Vale is marked by her paranoia and emotional instability, which becomes evident when she orders Tyrion Lannister’s trial by combat after he is brought to the Eyrie. She presides over the trial, demonstrating her authority as the ruler of the Vale.\n\nLysa’s personal life is marked by tragedy, including multiple miscarriages, which have contributed to her fragile mental state. She is also the mother of Robert Arryn, a sickly boy whose well-being she fiercely protects. Her relationship with her sister Catelyn is strained, particularly after Catelyn brings Tyrion to the Eyrie, an act that angers Lysa. Additionally, Lysa is the aunt of Sansa Stark, whom she later accuses of seducing Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger) before meeting a tragic end when she is pushed out the Moon Door.\n\nLysa’s connections to other characters are notable, including her famous uncle, Brynden \"\"The Blackfish\"\" Tully, who once interested Jaime Lannister more than she did. She is also a figure of interest to Sandor Clegane, who intends to ransom Arya Stark to her. Her interactions with key figures like Tyrion, Littlefinger, and her own family highlight her complex and often unstable role in the political landscape of Westeros. Despite her flaws, Lysa Arryn remains a significant figure in the power struggles of the realm, particularly in the Vale.\",19\r\n268,ARRYN,Jon Arryn was a prominent figure whose death is under investigation by Ned Stark,3\r\n264,MAESTER COLEMON,\"Maester Colemon is a scholar and maester who served House Arryn, playing a significant role in the affairs of the Vale. As the former maester to Jon Arryn, he was deeply involved in the late Lord’s plans and concerns, particularly regarding the health and future of Robert Arryn, Jon’s sickly heir. Colemon was later sent away by Grand Maester Pycelle, though the exact circumstances of his dismissal remain unclear. Despite this, he remained a figure of knowledge and authority, often reflecting on Jon Arryn’s intentions for Robert’s well-being and governance. His expertise and dedication to House Arryn underscore his importance in the political and medical matters of the Vale, even after his departure.\",2\r\n1805,MOON DOOR,A dangerous opening in the Eyrie where Lysa Arryn is pushed to her death,1\r\n378,BLOODY GATE,\"The Bloody Gate is a fortified pass situated in the Mountains of the Moon, serving as the primary entrance to the Vale of Arryn.

Their marriage was a significant political alliance, though it was later marred by tragedy. Jon Arryn’s death became a pivotal event in the political landscape of Westeros, as it set off a chain of events leading to Robert Baratheon’s death and the subsequent War of the Five Kings.\n\nLysa Arryn played a direct role in Jon Arryn’s demise, poisoning him under the manipulation of Petyr Baelish, also known as Littlefinger. Despite her involvement in his murder, Lysa publicly claimed that Jon Arryn had been killed by Cersei Lannister and her family, using this accusation to justify her actions and rally support. She sought to avenge Jon Arryn’s death, though her true motives were complicated by her own involvement in the crime.\n\nJon Arryn, a respected and powerful lord, had been serving as the Hand of the King to Robert Baratheon before his untimely death. His murder was initially shrouded in mystery, with Lysa’s false accusations against the Lannisters adding to the political tension.
