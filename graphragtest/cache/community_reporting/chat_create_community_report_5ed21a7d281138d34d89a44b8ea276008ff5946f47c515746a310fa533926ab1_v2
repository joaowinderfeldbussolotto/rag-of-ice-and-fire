She serves as a religious and mystical advisor to Stannis Baratheon, whom she proclaims as Azor Ahai reborn, the prophesied savior. Melisandre wields significant power over Stannis and his followers, including his wife, Selyse, through her faith and prophetic visions, which she discerns through flames. Her influence extends to political and strategic matters, often shaping Stannis's decisions, though she is feared by many of his men.\n\nA figure of dark magic and prophecy, Melisandre is involved in numerous controversial acts, including the burning of Mance Rayder and the Horn of Joramun, as well as planning to sacrifice Manceâ€™s baby for a spell. She is also responsible for the burning of the statues of the Seven, replacing them with symbols of R'hllor. Her actions are often blamed for misfortunes, such as the deaths of Stannis's sons, and she survives an assassination attempt by Maester Cressen.\n\nMelisandre interacts with key figures like Jon Snow, warning him of dangers and offering prophecies about his sister and the rangers. She discourages Jon from leading a rescue mission to Hardhome, citing her visions. She also plays a role in ceremonial duties, such as conducting a marriage ceremony, and advises Stannis on rising threats, including the emergence of new kings.\n\nHer visions reveal glimpses of war and future events, such as Arya Stark's escape. Despite her mystical abilities, she is not infallible, as seen when she seeks Edric Storm for a ritual, only to be thwarted. Melisandreâ€™s beliefs center on the conflict between R'hllor and the Great Other, and she uses her influence to further Stannisâ€™s cause, often through controversial and morally ambiguous means. Her presence is marked by both reverence and fear, making her one of the most enigmatic figures in the realm.\",22\r\n1387,SER CORTNAY PENROSE,A castellan who defies Stannis and refuses to surrender Storm's End,2\r\n739,ASSHAI,\"Asshai is a distant and enigmatic city shrouded in mystery, frequently referenced in connection with significant characters and artifacts. It is the origin of Melisandre, the red priestess, and the language she uses in her prayers, hinting at its deep cultural and spiritual influence. The city is also tied to the black amethysts found in Sansa Starkâ€™s hairnet, suggesting its role in the trade or crafting of rare and mystical items.\n\nQuaithe, a shadowbinder from Asshai, advises Daenerys Targaryen that she will find truth in the city, implying its importance as a place of revelation or hidden knowledge. Additionally, Asshai is associated with shadowbinders, as evidenced by Stannis Baratheonâ€™s pursuit of one, further emphasizing its connection to dark magic and esoteric practices. The cityâ€™s recurring mentions in relation to powerful figures and arcane elements underscore its significance as a nexus of intrigue, prophecy, and otherworldly forces in the broader narrative.\",4\r\n792,R'HLLOR,\"R'hllor is a prominent deity worshipped by Melisandre, a key religious figure, and her followers, including Stannis Baratheon and Queen Selyse. This foreign god is central to their faith, often associated with omens, power, and supernatural influence. Melisandre and Selyse actively promote the worship of R'hllor, with Queen Selyse even seeking to convert the wildlings to this religion. The faith of R'hllor is also supported by priests who align themselves with Daenerys Targaryen, suggesting its influence extends beyond Stannis' followers.\n\nR'hllor is frequently referenced in the context of violent acts, including killings and sacrifices, which are believed to appease the deity or achieve specific outcomes. For instance, sacrifices are made to R'hllor with the intention of halting snowfall, demonstrating the god's perceived control over natural elements. The religion surrounding R'hllor is characterized by its emphasis on divine intervention, prophecy, and the wielding of power through faith. Followers of R'hllor often interpret events as signs or messages from the deity, reinforcing their devotion and actions in its name. Despite its foreign origins, the worship of R'hllor has gained significant traction among certain factions, shaping their political and military strategies.\",7\r\n769,SELYSE,\"Queen Selyse Baratheon is the wife of King Stannis Baratheon and a devout follower of the Lord of Light, R'hllor.

Selyse is known for her strong adherence to the faith of R'hllor, often insisting that the god is the only ally needed in their endeavors.\n\nAs queen, Selyse accompanies Stannis in his campaigns and political maneuvers, including her arrival at Castle Black with her entourage. She attends significant events, such as the wedding at Castle Black, where her presence underscores her role as Stannis' consort and a figure of authority. However, her rigid beliefs sometimes lead her to oppose pragmatic decisions, such as when she discourages Jon Snow from leading a rescue mission to Hardhome, likely due to her conviction that R'hllor's will should guide their actions.\n\nSelyse's character is marked by her religious devotion and her alignment with Melisandre, which shapes her worldview and her approach to governance. Her relationship with Stannis is defined by both loyalty and shared faith, though her extreme piety occasionally puts her at odds with others who do not share her convictions. Despite her stern and unyielding demeanor, she remains a key figure in Stannis' court, embodying the intersection of political power and religious zeal.\",9\r\n768,CRESSEN,\"Maester Cressen is an elderly and devoted servant of House Baratheon, having served as a maester on Dragonstone for many years.

As an aged and wise counselor, Cressen remains deeply loyal to Stannis, offering him guidance and reflecting on past events, often interacting with both Stannis and his trusted advisor, Davos Seaworth.\n\nCressen grows increasingly concerned by the influence of Melisandre, the Red Priestess, over Stannis and his court. Viewing her as a dangerous and corrupting presence, he opposes her sway over the king and fears the consequences of her actions. In a desperate attempt to protect Stannis and the realm from what he perceives as her malevolent influence, Cressen devises a plan to poison Melisandre. However, his attempt fails, as Melisandre, aware of his intentions, uses her powers to ensure the poison affects Cressen instead, leading to his death.\n\nDespite his failure, Cressenâ€™s actions underscore his unwavering dedication to Stannis and his deep-seated mistrust of Melisandreâ€™s growing power. His character is marked by wisdom, loyalty, and a sense of duty, making him a tragic figure whose efforts to safeguard his king ultimately result in his downfall.

His attempt, however, proves unsuccessful, as Melisandreâ€™s mystical abilities or sheer luck thwart his efforts. This failed assassination underscores the direct and irreconcilable conflict between the two characters, highlighting Cressenâ€™s desperation and Melisandreâ€™s resilience. The confrontation serves as a pivotal moment, illustrating the ideological and personal clash between traditional wisdom and the rising power of faith and prophecy in the political landscape of Westeros.
