He held the rank of a military officer and was involved in various investigations and conflicts during his service. Rykker participated in the vows ceremony, a significant ritual for new recruits joining the Night's Watch, demonstrating his role in upholding the order's traditions.\n\nRykker was known for his dismissive attitude toward supernatural occurrences, as evidenced by his skepticism regarding Ghost, the direwolf of Jon Snow, whose actions he attributed to mere happenstance. This skepticism may have reflected his broader views on the threats posed by the supernatural forces beyond the Wall.\n\nTragically, Ser Jaremy Rykker met his end when he was killed by a wight, one of the reanimated corpses that serve the White Walkers. After his death, his armor and cloak were inherited by Thoren Smallwood, another member of the Night's Watch, signifying the continuation of his legacy within the order. Rykker's life and death underscore the dangers faced by those who serve in the Night's Watch and the ever-present threat of the supernatural forces they are sworn to protect against.\",2\r\n881,THOREN SMALLWOOD,\"Thoren Smallwood is a prominent ranger of the Night's Watch, known for his leadership and strong opinions on military strategy. He is often seen wearing Jaremy Rykker's armor, which lends him a more lordly appearance compared to other members of the Night's Watch, including Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. Smallwood is a vocal figure within the order, frequently engaging in discussions about leadership and tactics, at times even arguing with Mormont over command decisions.\n\nAs a seasoned ranger, Smallwood is deeply involved in the defense of the Night's Watch's positions, particularly the Fist of the First Men, where he contributes to strategic planning. He is also a scout leader, tasked with critical missions such as probing the Milkwater, demonstrating his expertise in reconnaissance and frontier operations. His experience and assertiveness lead him to advocate for direct confrontation with Mance Rayder's wildling forces, believing in a proactive approach to the growing threat beyond the Wall.\n\nSmallwood is also noted for his observations on the cultural and natural aspects of the North, including comments on the significance of heart trees and the wildlings. Despite his stern demeanor, he has shown a more personal side, vouching for Craster as a friend, indicating a complex relationship with the controversial wildling ally of the Night's Watch. His multifaceted role—ranging from combat leadership to diplomatic interactions—highlights his importance within the Night's Watch during a time of increasing peril.\",6\r\n1327,MILKWATER,\"**Summary of Milkwater**\n\nMilkwater is a notable river situated in a rugged and rocky landscape, characterized by high stony hills. It is visible from the rocks that Jon climbs, suggesting its proximity to elevated terrain.
