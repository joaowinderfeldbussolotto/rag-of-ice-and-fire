Led by Beric Dondarrion, a charismatic and resilient figure, the brotherhood is also guided by Thoros of Myr, a red priest who plays a significant role in their activities. Initially formed as a band of outlaws, they are deeply involved in the conflicts plaguing the Riverlands, often clashing with Lannister forces and other adversaries.\n\nAt various points, the Brotherhood Without Banners has been associated with key locations and events, including their stay at The Peach brothel and their activities near High Heart, a place of mystical significance. Their movements and actions are often driven by their search for justice and vengeance, as well as their loyalty to Dondarrion. Despite their outlaw status, they operate with a sense of purpose, often targeting those they perceive as oppressors or enemies of the smallfolk.\n\nThe group’s dynamic shifts over time, particularly as they navigate leadership changes and evolving goals. Their involvement in the broader political and military landscape of the Riverlands underscores their importance as both a military force and a symbol of resistance. The Brotherhood Without Banners remains a notable faction, marked by their defiance of authority and their commitment to their cause.\",12\r\n313,THOROS OF MYR,\"Thoros of Myr is a red priest and warrior-priest known for his devotion to the Lord of Light, R'hllor, and his distinctive flaming sword. Originally sent to the Seven Kingdoms to spread the faith of R'hllor, he became renowned for his martial prowess, particularly after scaling the walls of Pyke with his flaming blade. Over time, Thoros underwent a transformation, shifting from a more worldly existence to a more spiritual one, fully embracing his role as a servant of the Lord of Light.\n\nHe is a key figure in the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of outlaws turned vigilantes who oppose the injustices of the war-torn realm. Thoros played a crucial role in saving Beric Dondarrion, the leader of the Brotherhood, and is known for his ability to resurrect him through the power of R'hllor. Together, they employ hit-and-run tactics to disrupt the forces of the Lannisters and others, particularly targeting Tywin Lannister’s foraging parties. Thoros is also involved in the Brotherhood’s mission to bring Ser Gregor Clegane to justice for his atrocities.\n\nUnlike many warriors, Thoros is noted for his fairness, often paying villagers for what he and his companions took, a practice that set him apart from others. His actions and leadership make him a target for figures like Bonifer Hasty, whom Jaime Lannister commands to kill Thoros if captured. Additionally, there are suspicions that Thoros may have been hiding with Yoren’s group at some point, further linking him to the Brotherhood’s activities.\n\nThoros is also known for his role in informing Brienne of Tarth about the Brotherhood Without Banners, highlighting his continued involvement in the group’s operations. His reputation as a warrior is solidified by his victory in a melee, where his skill with the flaming sword set him apart. Despite his past as a more secular figure, Thoros of Myr is now a devoted follower of R'hllor, using his abilities to fight for justice and the faith he represents.\",8\r\n1576,HIGH HEART,\"High Heart is an ancient and significant location in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*.
