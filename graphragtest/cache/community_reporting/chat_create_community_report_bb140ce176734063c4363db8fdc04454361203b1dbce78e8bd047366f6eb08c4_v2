His fate is also foreshadowed in Jojen Reed’s green dream, where he is mentioned as one of the drowned men, reinforcing the tragic nature of his demise.\n\nMikken’s character is further tied to Theon’s subconscious, as the deceased man appears in Theon’s dreams, symbolizing guilt or unresolved conflict.

Eddard Stark is revered as a noble and honorable man, whose actions and decisions shaped the fate of his house and the realm.\",1\r\n414,UNCLE BENJEN,\"Uncle Benjen is a significant figure in the narrative, known for his dual roles as a member of the Night's Watch and a missing relative of Bran and Robb Stark.

For Bran, knighthood was once a cherished dream, symbolizing honor, valor, and purpose. However, his injury has rendered this ambition impossible, highlighting the physical and perhaps symbolic barriers that can prevent one from achieving such a status. This reflects the harsh reality that knighthood is not merely a title but a demanding role that requires physical capability and dedication.\n\nSimilarly, Ser Barristan Selmy, a renowned knight himself, contemplates the possibility of training his squires to become knights. His consideration underscores the traditional path to knighthood, which involves mentorship, rigorous training, and the passing down of values. However, Barristan ultimately decides against pursuing this due to his impending death, suggesting that the process of becoming a knight is not only time-consuming but also dependent on the guidance of experienced figures. His decision reflects the weight of responsibility and the recognition that knighthood is a legacy that requires continuity and commitment.\n\nTogether, these descriptions portray knighthood as both a noble aspiration and a challenging, sometimes elusive, goal. It is a status that demands physical prowess, mentorship, and personal sacrifice, making it a revered yet difficult path to follow. The narratives of Bran and Barristan illustrate the personal and external obstacles that can stand in the way of achieving knighthood, emphasizing its significance and the complexities surrounding it.\",1\r\n844,KING SLAYER,A person Bran wishes to harm in his wolf form,1\r\n1030,HARVEST FEAST,\"Harvest Feast is an event hosted by Bran Stark at Winterfell, a significant gathering that marks a time of celebration and communal bonding.
