He is the father of several sons and owes his knighthood and elevated status to Stannis, who rewarded him for his past services. Davos is a simply dressed knight, known for his humility and compassion, as demonstrated when he showed pity to Maester Cressen.\n\nAs a key advisor, Davos plays a crucial role in Stannis' campaign to claim the Iron Throne, witnessing significant events such as the burning of the Seven and participating in strategic discussions. He is deeply loyal to Stannis but often questions the methods of Melisandre, the Red Priestess, particularly regarding her influence over the king and her treatment of Edric Storm, whom Davos seeks to protect.\n\nDavos undertakes missions on Stannis' behalf, including a failed expedition to the Stormlands, where he reports back on the outcomes. Despite his loyalty, his relationship with Stannis is complex; there are reports that he was executed by Lord Manderly, though the circumstances remain unclear. Regardless, Davos remains a steadfast and principled figure, balancing his duty to Stannis with his moral convictions. His character is marked by both his strategic acumen and his humanity, making him a unique and respected figure in Stannis' inner circle.\",11\r\n771,PYLOS,\"Maester Pylos is a solemn 25-year-old maester who serves as the successor to Maester Cressen on Dragonstone. Initially instructed to let Cressen rest, Pylos later becomes Cressenâ€™s assistant, though he fails to wake him for a feast. Despite his youth, he takes on significant responsibilities, including assisting with the arrival of the white raven, a symbol of great importance in their world. Pylos is not particularly fond of Dragonstone, yet he fulfills his duties diligently.\n\nAs a teacher, Pylos plays a crucial role in helping Davos Seaworth learn to read, demonstrating his patience and dedication to education. He is also aware of a warning from the Wall, indicating his involvement in broader political and strategic matters. Additionally, Pylos advises Edric Storm to heed Davosâ€™ counsel, showing his respect for Davos and his understanding of the importance of wise guidance. Through these actions, Maester Pylos proves himself a capable and conscientious successor to Cressen, balancing his duties as a scholar, teacher, and advisor.\",6\r\n1526,ALESTER,\"Alester is a lord who serves as the Hand of the King to Stannis Baratheon. Despite his position of authority, his tenure is marked by controversy and mistrust. At one point, he is left in darkness and accused of treason, suggesting a fall from favor or a betrayal of Stannis' trust. Additionally, Alester is known to have received a warning letter regarding the Wall, a critical matter of security and survival. However, he fails to inform either Stannis or Melisandre about the letter's contents, an omission that could have significant consequences. This act of secrecy or negligence further complicates his standing and raises questions about his loyalty and competence. His role as Hand of the King, combined with these questionable actions, paints a complex picture of a man caught between duty and suspicion.\",2\r\n772,SHIREEN,\"Shireen Baratheon is the daughter of Stannis Baratheon and Queen Selyse. She is a young princess disfigured by greyscale, a condition that has left her with noticeable facial scars.

She is also known to suffer from nightmares, adding to her melancholic demeanor.\n\nShireen accompanies her mother, Queen Selyse, to Castle Black, where she meets Davos Seaworth after he is put ashore. Her presence and condition are discussed by Val and Jon Snow, highlighting her significance in political and personal matters. Shireenâ€™s life is marked by her fatherâ€™s ambitions, as she is proposed in marriage alliances to strengthen Stannisâ€™ position. Notably, she is offered as a potential bride to both Tommen Baratheon and Robert Arryn, with the latter being part of a strategic marriage pact to secure alliances. These proposals underscore her role as a political pawn in her fatherâ€™s quest for power.\n\nDespite her sad and isolated upbringing, Shireen remains a compassionate and inquisitive figure, her resilience evident in her interactions and interests.

A wise and experienced advisor, he played a significant role during the siege of Storm's End, offering counsel to Stannis Baratheon. Despite his wisdom, his advice was frequently disregarded, particularly in matters of justice and strategy, such as when he advised against the execution of Ser Gawen Wylde. His influence waned as Stannis increasingly favored the guidance of Melisandre, whose mystical powers contrasted sharply with Cressen's rational approach. In a final act of desperation, seeking to rid Dragonstone of Melisandre's influence, he attempted to poison her but ultimately took his own life when the plan failed. His character serves as a poignant reminder of the limitations of wisdom in the face of fanaticism and the shifting loyalties of power.\",7\r\n775,WHITE RAVEN,\"The White Raven is a rare and significant bird sent from the Citadel, serving as a messenger to signal the changing of seasons.

Despite his incoherent and erratic demeanor, Patchface remains a constant presence in Shireenâ€™s life, often capering about in a manner that draws attention.\n\nPatchfaceâ€™s actions are not without consequence; he was notably involved in an incident involving a crown, though the specifics of this event remain unclear. His behavior and cryptic utterances have also made him a figure of intrigue, as he was once used in a scheme to spread rumors, though the details of this plot are not fully disclosed. Despite his oddities, Patchface accompanies Queen Selyse Baratheon to Castle Black, suggesting he holds some level of importance or attachment to the royal family.\n\nHis interactions with both Shireen and Cressen highlight his role as a fool, yet his cryptic songs and unpredictable nature set him apart from typical court jesters.
