He is the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a guerrilla faction that opposes the Lannister forces and fights for justice. Beric is renowned for his resilience, having been reported killed multiple times, including by Amory Lorch and the Bloody Mummers, yet he continues to reappear, earning him the eerie moniker \"\"Lord of Corpses.\"\"\n\nOriginally serving under the king's banner, Beric was sent by Ned Stark to dispense the king's justice against Gregor Clegane, marking his shift from a traditional knight to a rebel leader. He leads raids and ambushes against Lord Tywin Lannister's forces, particularly targeting their foraging parties and supply lines. His band is accused of raiding Saltpans, and he is sought by both Gregor Clegane and the Lannisters, who see him as a persistent threat.\n\nBeric is also a figure of intrigue and mystery. He is rumored to be associated with Yoren's group and is sought by the Brotherhood Without Banners themselves, adding to the legends surrounding his survival. Despite his outlaw status, he maintains a sense of justice, as seen when he judges Sandor Clegane, who later joins his band. His leadership and actions make him a key figure in the resistance against the Lannisters, and he is both feared and respected by his enemies.\n\nAdditionally, Beric is a figure of interest to various characters. Jeyne expresses willingness to marry him immediately, while Jaime Lannister requests his capture. Merrett Frey demands to see him before his execution, though Beric is notably absent during that event, as he is \"\"needed elsewhere.\"\" His whereabouts are often uncertain, and his movements are closely watched by both allies and foes.\n\nIn summary, Beric Dondarrion is a complex and enduring figure—a knight turned outlaw leader, a symbol of resistance, and a man whose death is repeatedly defied, making him one of the most intriguing characters in the realm.\",24\r\n295,MUD GATE,\"The Mud Gate is a prominent city gate in King’s Landing, serving as a key entry and exit point within the capital’s fortifications. It is notably associated with several significant events and characters from the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series. Beric Dondarrion, a knight and leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, arrives at the Mud Gate at one point, marking it as a location of strategic or narrative importance. Additionally, Arya Stark, during her time in King’s Landing, frequently checks the Mud Gate, suggesting its role in her observations or movements within the city.\n\nThe gate also holds military significance, as it is where Tyrion Lannister observes a battle and witnesses the devastating effects of wildfire, a volatile and destructive substance used in warfare. This event underscores the Mud Gate’s role in the defense and conflicts of King’s Landing, particularly during times of siege or attack. The gate’s name likely derives from its proximity to muddy or less fortified terrain, distinguishing it from other gates in the city. Overall, the Mud Gate is a multifaceted location, intertwined with both the daily life and pivotal moments of King’s Landing’s history.\",2\r\n914,BURTON CRAKEHALL,Burton Crakehall is a knight who was killed by Beric Dondarrion in an ambush,1\r\n1012,HOUSE DONDARRION,A noble house with a purple lightning bolt on black banner,1\r\n1989,LIGHTNING LORD'S BAND,\"A group led by Beric Dondarrion, accused of raiding Saltpans\",1\r\n1990,LORD TARLY,A noble spreading rumors to turn smallfolk against Beric Dondarrion,1\r\n2034,LADY AMEREI,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n480,BERIC DONDARRION,TOURNEY OF THE HAND,Beric Dondarrion participates in the Tourney of the Hand,28\r\n479,MUD GATE,BERIC DONDARRION,Beric Dondarrion arrives at the Mud Gate,26\r\n1786,BERIC DONDARRION,BURTON CRAKEHALL,Beric Dondarrion killed Burton Crakehall in an ambush,25\r\n2013,BERIC DONDARRION,HOUSE DONDARRION,Beric Dondarrion is a member of House Dondarrion,25\r\n3976,BERIC DONDARRION,LIGHTNING LORD'S BAND,Beric Dondarrion is the leader of the Lightning Lord's band,25\r\n3977,BERIC DONDARRION,LORD TARLY,Lord Tarly spreads rumors to turn smallfolk against Beric Dondarrion,25\r\n4023,BERIC DONDARRION,LADY AMEREI,Lady Amerei begs Jaime to help defeat Beric Dondarrion,25\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
