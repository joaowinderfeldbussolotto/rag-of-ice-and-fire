Raised at Winterfell alongside his half-siblings, including Bran, Arya, and Robb, Jon is deeply connected to his family despite his status as a bastard. He is known for his direwolf, Ghost, and his skilled swordsmanship, which earns him the Valyrian steel sword Longclaw from Lord Commander Jeor Mormont.\n\nJon joins the Night’s Watch as a recruit at Castle Black, where he befriends Samwell Tarly, protecting him from bullying and advocating for his skills. He rises through the ranks, becoming the 998th Lord Commander, leading the defense of the Wall and making critical strategic decisions. His leadership is marked by his efforts to negotiate with wildlings, including Tormund, and his controversial decision to allow them passage through the Wall to save lives.\n\nJon’s journey is fraught with conflict and introspection. He struggles with his identity, loyalty, and the weight of his vows, particularly when he considers deserting to join Robb Stark’s war effort. However, he is ultimately convinced to remain by Mormont. His experiences beyond the Wall are pivotal, including his capture by the Thenns, his interactions with Ygritte, and his visions involving weirwood trees and direwolves. He also faces supernatural threats, such as wights, and engages in wolf dreams that hint at deeper mystical connections.\n\nJon plays a crucial role in the political and military affairs of the North, advising Stannis Baratheon and mediating conflicts. He is involved in key events, such as the defense of Castle Black, the rescue mission at Hardhome, and the discovery of dragonglass. His relationship with Ygritte, a wildling, further complicates his loyalties, and her death deeply affects him.\n\nDespite his accomplishments, Jon faces accusations of betrayal and must navigate the complexities of leadership, including sending Aemon Targaryen away and making difficult choices for the greater good. His story is one of resilience, duty, and the enduring bonds of family and brotherhood, as he seeks to protect the realm from the threats beyond the Wall.\",122\r\n218,JEOR MORMONT,\"Jeor Mormont is a prominent figure in the Night's Watch, serving as its Lord Commander.

His leadership is tested during a notable defeat at the Fist, highlighting the dangers and difficulties faced by the Night's Watch. Despite setbacks, he remains a key figure, recognized for his ability to utilize men like Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne, though his judgment in trusting certain individuals is later questioned.\n\nMormont is also connected to Jon Snow, whom he mentors and trusts, though this trust is ultimately betrayed. He is the one whose raven awakens Jon from a dream, and he delivers a message from Robb Stark to Jon at Winterfell, underscoring his role as a bridge between the Night's Watch and the broader political landscape of Westeros. His relationship with Jon is complex, marked by both guidance and eventual betrayal, which leads to his tragic demise.\n\nJeor Mormont's legacy is that of a formidable but flawed leader, whose life and death significantly impact the Night's Watch and those under his command. His story reflects the harsh realities of leadership, loyalty, and the constant threats faced by the Watch.\",3\r\n1163,FROSTFANGS,\"The Frostfangs are a formidable and inhospitable mountain range located beyond the Wall, known for their harsh and unforgiving wilderness. This rugged region serves as a significant location in the activities of Mance Rayder, the self-proclaimed King-Beyond-the-Wall, who gathers his people and forces there. The Frostfangs are a strategic stronghold for the wildlings, where Mance Rayder consolidates his power and prepares for his ambitions south of the Wall.\n\nJon Snow, a prominent figure from the Night's Watch, encounters wildlings in the Frostfangs, highlighting the region's role as a frontier between the realms of men and the untamed wilderness beyond. The mountains are also notable for being the site where the Horn of Winter, a legendary artifact, was discovered, adding to their mystique and importance in the lore of the North.\n\nMance Rayder is actively involved in the Frostfangs, not only gathering his people but also seeking something of significance, as scouts are frequently sent into the region. The area is anticipated to be a key location for his return, further emphasizing its central role in the conflicts and alliances beyond the Wall. The Frostfangs, with their treacherous terrain and strategic value, remain a crucial and ominous presence in the struggles of the wildlings and the Night's Watch.\",3\r\n2364,WUN WUN,\"WUN WUN is a giant who plays a notable role in the events involving Ser Patrek. Unlike many giants, WUN WUN possesses the ability to speak the Common Tongue, which sets him apart and allows for limited communication with humans. Despite his imposing size and strength, he is initially protected by the sacred tradition of guest rights, which grants him a measure of safety and respect under the laws of hospitality.\n\nHowever, WUN WUN's demeanor takes a violent turn when he attacks Ser Patrek in a sudden and aggressive outburst. This act of violence contrasts sharply with his earlier status as a guest, suggesting a breakdown in the protections afforded to him or a moment of uncontrollable rage. The reasons for his attack are not fully detailed, but it marks a significant shift in his behavior, highlighting the unpredictable and dangerous nature of giants, even those who can communicate with humans.\n\nWUN WUN's duality—both as a guest under protection and as a violent assailant—paints a complex picture of his character. His ability to speak the Common Tongue suggests a level of intelligence and cultural awareness, yet his violent actions underscore the raw, untamed power that giants embody. This combination makes WUN WUN a fascinating and formidable figure in the narrative.\",2\r\n2418,QUEEN SELYSE,\"Queen Selyse is a notable figure who plays a significant role in interactions with key characters such as Jon Snow and Val, particularly concerning matters related to the wildlings. She is depicted as a queen who engages in discussions and decisions involving the wildlings, suggesting her involvement in political or strategic affairs beyond the Wall.

Her presence in these contexts highlights her influence and the respect or necessity of her involvement in pivotal events. While details about her personality or ruling style are not explicitly provided, her interactions with Jon and Val, as well as her role in the events leading up to Jon Snow's assassination, underscore her relevance in the broader narrative.\",2\r\n216,HARDEN’S TOWER,A building in Castle Black where Jon sleeps with Ghost,1\r\n277,RAST,\"RAST is a character associated with the Night's Watch, a military order in the fictional world of *A Song of Ice and Fire* and its television adaptation, *Game of Thrones*.

Over time, his antagonistic behavior escalates, leading to direct confrontations with Jon Snow and his allies. Rast’s hostility eventually results in him being sent to fight against Jon and his friends, further cementing his role as an adversary within the Night's Watch. His actions and demeanor highlight the harsh and often brutal environment of the Night's Watch, where conflict and power struggles are common. Rast’s character serves as a representation of the cruelty and hostility that can exist even among those sworn to the same order.\",1\r\n648,LONGCLAW,\"Longclaw is the Valyrian steel sword gifted to Jon Snow by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. Originally a heirloom of House Mormont, the sword was passed to Jon as a symbol of trust and leadership.

Initially part of the training group under Jon Snow, he was one of the boys from Jon's former training syndicate. Over time, Matthar demonstrated enough skill and dedication to earn a promotion within the Night's Watch. Despite his advancement, he remained connected to his past training group, even attempting to persuade Jon Snow to return to their ranks. His journey reflects both his growth within the Night's Watch and his lingering ties to his fellow recruits.\",1\r\n1421,STONESNAKE,\"**STONESNAKE** is a ranger of the Night's Watch, known for his association with Jon Snow. He serves as a companion to Jon, particularly teaching him the skills of climbing.

He is notably recognized for calling Jon Snow a \"\"skinchanger,\"\" a term used to describe individuals with the ability to enter the minds of animals and control them. This suggests that Ebben is aware of Jon's unique abilities or at least suspects them, hinting at his observant or perceptive nature.\n\nAs a member of the Night's Watch, Ebben is subject to the organization's strict hierarchy and duties. At one point, he is sent back to the Lord Commander, indicating that he may have been involved in a mission or assignment that required his return to the leadership. The reason for his return is not specified, but it could imply disciplinary action, a report, or a reassignment. His role within the Night's Watch, while not extensively detailed, positions him as a figure of some importance or at least one who interacts with higher-ranking members.\n\nEbben's character is thus defined by his association with the Night's Watch, his knowledge of Jon Snow's abilities, and his involvement in the order's operations. His actions and words contribute to the broader narrative of the Night's Watch and its members, particularly in relation to Jon Snow.\",1\r\n1609,MAGNAR,The Magnar is a leader whose men compete with Jarl's to climb the Wall,1\r\n1646,THE MAGNAR,The Magnar is a leader of the Thenns who commands Jon to kill a captive,1\r\n828,SLYNT,\"SLYNT is a character in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, prominently associated with the Gold Cloaks, the city watch of King’s Landing. As a commander of the Gold Cloaks, he is known for his incompetence and brutality, often carrying out sentences with excessive force. His leadership is marked by a lack of skill and a heavy-handed approach, making him a controversial figure within the organization.\n\nSlynt is also mentioned by Bronn in discussions about political replacements and power dynamics, suggesting his involvement in the shifting loyalties and machinations of the capital. His role in these political maneuverings highlights his alignment with those in power, often at the expense of justice or fairness.\n\nAdditionally, Slynt harbors strong disdain for Jon Snow, whom he considers a traitor for not executing Mance Rayder, the leader of the wildlings. This perspective underscores Slynt’s rigid and uncompromising nature, as well as his adherence to harsh interpretations of duty and loyalty. His views on Jon reflect his broader tendencies toward brutality and a lack of nuance in his judgments.\n\nOverall, Slynt is depicted as a flawed and often reviled figure, whose actions and leadership leave a lasting negative impression on those around him. His character serves as an example of the corruption and ineptitude that can permeate positions of authority in the turbulent world of Westeros.\",1\r\n531,DYWEN,\"Dywen is a seasoned and gnarled forester, as well as a ranger of the Night’s Watch, known for his sharp observations and dry wit. A survivor of both Craster’s Keep and the Bridge of Skulls, he eventually returns to Castle Black, where he interacts with fellow members of the Night’s Watch, including Jon Snow. Dywen is particularly vocal about his experiences beyond the Wall, often making bold claims about the strange and unsettling things he has encountered there.\n\nAs a forester, Dywen expresses discomfort about the eerie occurrences in the haunted forest, particularly noting the lack of game and the unsettling presence of something lurking in the night. He is also known for his keen sense of smell, once remarking on the peculiar \"\"smell of cold\"\" in the air. His suspicions extend to Othor, whom he suggests carried an axe, hinting at deeper, darker events beyond the Wall.\n\nDywen is not one to shy away from criticism, openly disparaging Craster’s reputation and sharing his skepticism with others. Despite his gruff demeanor, he maintains a sense of humor, often joking about his past interactions with women. His role as a ranger also involves reporting critical information, such as the movements of the queen’s men, to Jon Snow and other leaders at Castle Black.\n\nA survivor of harrowing battles and a witness to the supernatural horrors beyond the Wall, Dywen’s experiences make him a valuable, if somewhat cynical, member of the Night’s Watch. His insights and warnings serve as a reminder of the dangers that lurk in the far north, reinforcing the vigilance required of those who serve in the order.\",1\r\n2192,KEDGE WHITEYE,\"KEDGE WHITEYE is a notable figure within the narrative, serving as a leader of a ranging party dispatched by Jon.
