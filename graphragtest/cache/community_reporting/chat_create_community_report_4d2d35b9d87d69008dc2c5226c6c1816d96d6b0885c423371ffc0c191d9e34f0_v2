They are infamous for orchestrating the Red Wedding, a treacherous event that resulted in the massacre of House Stark and their allies, solidifying their reputation as cunning and merciless players in the political landscape. The family maintains a strong military presence, with armed members stationed at key locations such as Castle Darry, demonstrating their readiness to defend their interests and exert control.\n\nIn addition to their military prowess, the Freys hold significant influence through their control over key figures. They are currently holding Edmure Tully hostage, leveraging his captivity to further their political ambitions. Furthermore, they have managed to subdue Jason Mallister, another notable figure, thereby expanding their dominance in the region. Despite their formidable status, the Freys have also faced setbacks, as some of their members were captured during a recent battle, highlighting the volatile and unpredictable nature of their conflicts.\n\nOverall, the Freys are a family marked by both their strategic brilliance and their capacity for brutality, making them a formidable force in the realm. Their actions, from the Red Wedding to their control over key figures and territories, underscore their determination to maintain and expand their power, regardless of the cost.\",3\r\n1713,THE RED WEDDING,\"The Red Wedding was a brutal and infamous event during the War of the Five Kings in the fictional world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. It took place at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, orchestrated by Lord Walder Frey in collaboration with House Bolton. The massacre was a calculated act of betrayal, where Robb Stark, his mother Catelyn Tully, and many of their bannermen were brutally murdered under the guise of guest right, violating the sacred laws of hospitality. The event marked a turning point in the war, devastating House Stark and their allies, while solidifying the treacherous reputation of both House Frey and House Bolton. The Red Wedding remains one of the most shocking and pivotal moments in the series, symbolizing the ruthless nature of political power struggles in Westeros.\",7\r\n302,JASON MALLISTER,\"Lord Jason Mallister is a prominent bannerman of House Tully, distinguished by his loyalty and service to the family. He is notably present at key events, including Hoster Tully’s funeral and a significant meeting, demonstrating his commitment to the Tully cause. As a bannerman to Catelyn Stark’s father, Lord Hoster Tully, Jason Mallister leads a party of soldiers, showcasing his military role within the Tully forces.\n\nVisually striking, Lord Jason Mallister is recognized for his eagle-winged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor, which set him apart on the battlefield. His leadership is further evident when he joins Robb Stark’s forces at Hag's Mire, reinforcing his allegiance to the Stark-Tully alliance during the War of the Five Kings.\n\nDespite his noble bearing and military contributions, Jason Mallister is portrayed as a lord who lacks the strength to stand alone, particularly against formidable foes like the Lannisters. This vulnerability is compounded by the Freys, who keep him penned up, limiting his ability to act independently. His dependence on stronger allies underscores the challenges faced by lesser lords in the complex political landscape of Westeros.\n\nIn summary, Lord Jason Mallister is a loyal and visually distinctive bannerman of House Tully, whose military leadership is tempered by his inability to stand alone against powerful enemies. His role in key events and his allegiance to the Starks and Tullys highlight his importance, even as his limitations shape his actions.\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1297,ROBB STARK,THE FREYS,Members of the Freys were captured in the battle led by Robb Stark,85\r\n3485,THE RED WEDDING,THE FREYS,The Freys orchestrated the Red Wedding,10\r\n3428,JASON MALLISTER,THE FREYS,The Freys keep Jason Mallister penned up at his seat,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
