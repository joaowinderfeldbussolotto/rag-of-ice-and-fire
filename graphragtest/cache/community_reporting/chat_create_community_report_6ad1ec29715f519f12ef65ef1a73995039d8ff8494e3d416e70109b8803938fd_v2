However, his intentions are not entirely altruistic, as he refuses to provide her with the warships she seeks, despite his apparent generosity. Xaro’s true motives become clearer when it is revealed that he secretly desires one of Daenerys’s dragons, suggesting that his offers of protection and marriage may be driven by self-interest rather than genuine concern for her well-being.\n\nAs one of Daenerys’s companions during her time in Qarth, Xaro advises her against entering the House of the Undying, a mysterious and dangerous place. His counsel reflects a mix of caution and self-preservation, as he likely fears the risks associated with such an endeavor. Despite his role as an advisor, his actions and motives remain ambiguous, blending assistance with personal ambition. Xaro’s character embodies the complex and often duplicitous nature of the powerful figures in Qarth, where alliances are fragile and self-interest frequently dictates behavior.

During her time in the House of the Undying, Daenerys experiences a series of vivid and prophetic visions, which play a crucial role in her journey and understanding of her destiny. The visions she witnesses are both cryptic and revealing, offering glimpses into her future and the challenges she must face.

This event underscores his fierce and unpredictable nature, as well as the challenges Daenerys faces in controlling him.
