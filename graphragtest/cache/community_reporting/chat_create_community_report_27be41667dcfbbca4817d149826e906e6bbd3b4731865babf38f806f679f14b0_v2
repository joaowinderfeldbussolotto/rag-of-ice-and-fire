They are infamous for their betrayal at the Red Wedding, where they played a pivotal role in the massacre of Robb Stark and his forces, aligning themselves with House Bolton. This betrayal was partly motivated by Robb Stark’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which broke a prior marriage pact with the Freys, deepening their resentment.\n\nThe Freys hold considerable sway over Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, though their relationship is strained. They were responsible for the death of Ser Wendel Manderly during the sack of Winterfell and later brought his bones to the Manderlys, attempting to mend relations through proposed marriages. However, their past atrocities, including Wendel’s death, have left lasting enmity.\n\nAs advisors to Roose Bolton, the Freys believed in the inevitability of Robb Stark’s defeat and actively worked against the Northmen. They were involved in the siege of Riverrun and may have participated in attacks on Stannis Baratheon’s forces. Their presence in the North has been marked by tension, particularly after Edmure Tully’s return, which led some Frey members to depart.\n\nThe Freys are also known for their role in confirming the execution of Davos Seaworth, further solidifying their reputation as a ruthless and politically calculating house.
