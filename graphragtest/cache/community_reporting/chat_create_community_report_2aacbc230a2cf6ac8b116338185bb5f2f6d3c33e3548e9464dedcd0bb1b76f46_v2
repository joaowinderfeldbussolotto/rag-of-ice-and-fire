As the youngest daughter of Aerys II Targaryen, she is the sister of Viserys Targaryen and is renowned for hatching three dragons, solidifying her identity as the \"\"Dragon Queen.\"\" Her journey begins as an exiled princess, later marrying Khal Drogo in a Dothraki ceremony to secure an alliance, which marks the start of her rise to power.\n\nDaenerys commands loyalty from key figures such as Jorah Mormont, who seeks to serve and defend her, and she leads the Unsullied army, strategizing to capture cities like Yunkai with minimal losses. Her leadership extends to Meereen, where she rules as Queen, navigating complex political and social issues, including negotiations with Hizdahr zo Loraq and her complicated feelings for Daario Naharis. She is also a figure of interest to others, such as Quentyn Martell, who seeks her alliance, and Jon Connington, who views her as a potential ally if she leaves Meereen.\n\nHer path is fraught with challenges, including a plot targeting her life, her hesitance about an upcoming wedding, and a siege in Meereen. She is also mentioned in the context of broader narratives, such as Robert Baratheon’s final moments and Ned Stark’s reflections on her fate. Daenerys experiences mystical visions after entering the House of the Undying and plays a crucial role in the Dothraki Sea narrative, where she builds a funeral pyre for Khal Drogo and leads her khalasar into the Red Waste, guided by a red comet.\n\nAt one point, she is a young Targaryen woman pregnant with a potential heir, furthering her dynasty’s legacy. However, her fate becomes uncertain after an event at Daznak’s Pit. Despite these trials, she remains a symbol of resilience and ambition, striving to reclaim her throne in the Seven Kingdoms while balancing her roles as a conqueror, ruler, and mother of dragons.\",66\r\n79,HOUSE TARGARYEN,\"House Targaryen is a noble and historically significant royal house in Westeros, renowned for its legacy as dragonlords and its former rule over the Seven Kingdoms. The house is prominently associated with key figures such as Aegon Targaryen, Rhaegar Targaryen, and Daenerys Targaryen, all of whom played pivotal roles in the political and military history of Westeros. Aegon Targaryen, often referred to as Aegon the Conqueror, was instrumental in uniting the realm under Targaryen rule, while Rhaegar Targaryen was deeply involved in the political intrigues that led to the dynasty's downfall.\n\nThe house's influence extended beyond its immediate members, as other noble families, such as Quentyn's father, sought their backing to bolster their own political ambitions. House Targaryen's reign came to an end when Robert Baratheon successfully overthrew the dynasty, marking the conclusion of their direct rule over Westeros. Despite their deposition, the Targaryens remained a symbol of power and mystique, particularly due to their unique connection to dragons, which set them apart from other noble houses.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen, one of the most notable members of the house, continued to uphold the Targaryen legacy, striving to reclaim the throne and restore her family's dominance. The house's history is thus characterized by both its glorious conquests and its eventual downfall, leaving an indelible mark on the political landscape of Westeros.

Additionally, Jhiqui attends to Daenerys during her illness, further highlighting her dedication as a caretaker.\n\nDespite her loyalty to Daenerys, Jhiqui also exhibits caution and fear, particularly when translating Viserys Targaryen's words, as she is wary of the potential consequences from Khal Drogo. This reflects the complex dynamics of her position, where she must navigate the expectations of both her mistress and the powerful figures around her.
