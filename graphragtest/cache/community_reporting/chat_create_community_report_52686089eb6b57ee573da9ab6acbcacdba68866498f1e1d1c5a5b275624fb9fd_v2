She becomes a captive of Ramsay Bolton, enduring mistreatment at his hands and those of his men. Her suffering is notable, as she is emotionally reactive to the harsh events around her, including the tourney where she accompanies Sansa Stark, displaying strong emotional responses.\n\nA pivotal moment in her story occurs during an escape attempt, where she screams, inadvertently revealing the group's position.

His brutal actions and ruthless nature define his character, making him a feared figure in the story.\n\nRamsay is particularly infamous for his role in the torment of Theon Greyjoy, whom he physically and psychologically tortures, breaking him both mentally and emotionally. Despite his cruelty, Ramsay manipulates Theon, offering him false promises, such as a bath, and coercing him into aiding his schemes, including the retrieval of his virgin bride. His sadistic behavior extends beyond Theon, as he takes pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on others, solidifying his reputation as a merciless master.\n\nA significant conflict arises when Jon Snow seeks to confront Ramsay at Winterfell, highlighting his role as a primary antagonist. His actions and ambitions pose a direct threat to the stability of the North, and his confrontation with Jon Snow underscores the broader struggle for power and justice in the region.
