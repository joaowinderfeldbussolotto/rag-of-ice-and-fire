Initially, he is part of Yoren's group of recruits traveling north, where he is teased by Lommy and Tarber, even being targeted with mud. Despite his fears, he admits to being scared and later guards the camp, insisting Arya stay close due to the threat of wolves. He is also a friend of Gendry, showing concern when he hears Arya’s scream.\n\nDuring their journey, Hot Pie is reluctant to enter Harrenhal, fearing its haunted reputation. Once inside, he is assigned to the kitchens, where he works alongside Arya. He witnesses her struggles with privacy but does not react strongly. Though he initially mocks Arya and even attempts to steal her sword, leading to a violent confrontation, he later becomes a more steadfast companion. However, his loyalty wavers at times—he panics during a rescue attempt and reluctantly helps Arya, even yielding to soldiers when pressured.\n\nDespite his hesitations, Hot Pie proves useful in moments of danger, scrambling to find a rock to defend against the gold cloaks in solidarity with Arya. He fights alongside her during battles but often succumbs to panic. After leaving Harrenhal, he travels with Arya and Gendry until they are discovered by Tom of Sevenstreams and his men. Eventually, Hot Pie decides to stay behind as a baker at an inn rather than continue the perilous journey, choosing a safer path.\n\nThroughout their time together, Hot Pie uses old poacher’s tricks and remains hesitant about confrontations, reflecting his cautious nature. Despite his flaws, he remains a memorable figure in Arya’s journey, embodying both fear and fleeting bravery.\",11\r\n865,CUTJACK,\"Cutjack is a member of Yoren's group, a recruit who plays a notable role in several key events. He accompanies Murch to investigate a ruined village and later assists in burying a woman, demonstrating his involvement in the group's activities. Cutjack is also known for his readiness to defend his companions, as seen when he pulls out his hammer in response to the threat posed by the gold cloaks. His actions reflect a sense of solidarity and loyalty, particularly when he stands with Arya by brandishing his hammer in her defense.\n\nHowever, Cutjack's loyalty is not absolute, as he is also described as a survivor who ultimately abandons Arya and her group, suggesting a prioritization of self-preservation over allegiance. Despite this, he is assigned responsibilities within the group, such as keeping watch from the towerhouse, indicating that he is trusted to some extent. His character is marked by a mix of bravery, practicality, and self-interest, making him a complex figure within Yoren's group.\",4\r\n1101,WEASEL,\"WEASEL is a young girl who traveled alongside Arya and was given her nickname by the group. Known for her emotional vulnerability, she was often seen crying during their journey. When confronted with danger, particularly when soldiers approached, WEASEL displayed a strong survival instinct by fleeing the scene. Her actions suggest a mix of fragility and quick thinking in high-pressure situations. Despite her youth, she navigated the challenges of travel and conflict, though her tendency to run may indicate a lack of trust or fear of confrontation. Her story reflects the hardships faced by those caught in turbulent times, where survival often depends on swift decisions.\",2\r\n1106,THE VILLAGE,A location where Arya and her companions seek food and encounter danger,2\r\n287,GENDRY,\"Gendry is a young blacksmith and former apprentice with a notable resemblance to King Robert Baratheon, leading to widespread speculation that he may be the late king’s bastard son. His lineage grants him a special status, and he was once sought by Jon Arryn before his death. Gendry is a skilled blacksmith who forged his own distinctive bull helmet, which he often wears, and his expertise in the forge spared him from execution.\n\nInitially an apprentice armorer, Gendry traveled with Yoren’s group of recruits for the Night’s Watch, where he assisted in burying the one-armed woman and wore his signature helmet. He later became a companion of Arya Stark, forming a close bond with her and Hot Pie. Though he initially refused to help Arya, he eventually aided her in escaping Harrenhal after being captured by Gregor Clegane’s men. During their journey, Gendry proved loyal and protective, helping Arya and Hot Pie when they were discovered by Tom of Sevenstreams and his men.\n\nGendry’s journey with Arya included traveling to the Hollow Hill and fighting alongside her, where he demonstrated bravery by killing Biter with a spear. He also assisted in practical tasks, such as searching for boats and helping with cook duty. Despite his reluctance to participate in prayers, his presence was marked by his strong resemblance to King Robert, further fueling suspicions about his parentage.\n\nAfter parting ways with Arya, Gendry joined the Brotherhood Without Banners, where he was knighted by Beric Dondarrion. Known as \"\"the Bull\"\" and wanted by the queen, Gendry’s life is shaped by his skills, his uncertain lineage, and his unwavering loyalty to those he travels with. His story intertwines with Arya’s, making him a key figure in her journey.\",18\r\n479,GREGOR CLEGANE,\"Gregor Clegane, commonly known as \"\"The Mountain\"\" or \"\"The Mountain That Rides,\"\" is a feared and brutal knight from House Clegane, renowned for his violence and atrocities. Serving as a loyal bannerman to House Lannister under Lord Tywin, he is a key figure in their military campaigns, often commanding the vanguard in battle. His reputation as a ruthless warrior is well-earned, marked by his involvement in numerous conflicts, including the Sack of King’s Landing, where he murdered a child, and the killing of Elia Martell, which fueled the Martells' desire for vengeance. Oberyn Martell sought to kill him for justice, and he became a target of Beric Dondarrion’s mission, rumored to have been killed by Beric twice, though he survived.\n\nGregor is associated with Harrenhal, having taken control of the castle and contributing to its dark history. He is also known for leading a group of 300 men to set fire to the riverlands, further cementing his role as a destructive force. His actions include capturing Gendry and Arya Stark, and his men were feared by Arya when they were near an inn. He is accused of raiding and destruction, earning the moniker \"\"The Enormity that Rides.\"\"\n\nDespite his formidable presence, Gregor suffered severe injuries, including wounds from the battle at the Red Fork and later experimentation by Qyburn, which left him in a dying state. He was also involved in conflicts with Bolton’s forces at the Trident and was tasked with setting fire to strategic locations. As Cersei Lannister’s champion, he participated in Tyrion’s trial by combat, reinforcing his role as a feared and loyal enforcer for the Lannisters.\n\nGregor’s legacy is one of brutality, torture, and fear, making him one of the most dreaded warriors in Westeros. His eventual fate, including his death and reanimation as Ser Robert Strong, underscores his enduring impact on the realm’s history.\",31\r\n1221,POLLIVER,\"Polliver is a character in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, notably encountered by Sandor Clegane (the Hound) and Arya Stark. He is a man associated with Ser Gregor Clegane (the Mountain) and serves as part of Tywin Lannister’s forces. During his time with the Lannister forces, Polliver is seen wearing Gendry’s helmet, which he likely took as spoils of war. He is also known for taking Arya Stark’s sword, Needle, and wearing it at his hip, an act that deeply angers Arya. This theft of Needle places Polliver on Arya’s list of people she wants dead, marking him as a target for her vengeance. Later, Polliver is depicted as carrying Needle before Arya ultimately recovers it, reinforcing his role as a significant antagonist in her journey. His actions and association with the brutal Mountain further cement his reputation as a ruthless and despised figure in Arya’s eyes.\",2\r\n476,SHERRER,Holdfast raided by Gregor Clegane's forces,1\r\n477,WENDISH TOWN,Village destroyed by Gregor Clegane's forces,1\r\n478,MUMMER'S FORD,Location where villagers were killed by raiders,1\r\n1553,LOTHAR MALLERY,A character who was part of the original group that rode out against Gregor Clegane and died,1\r\n1554,GLADDEN WYLDE,A character who was part of the original group that rode out against Gregor Clegane and died,1\r\n1701,BATTLE OF THE RUBY FORD,A battle where Gregor Clegane attacked Bolton's forces,1\r\n124,KING ROBERT,\"King Robert, also known as King Robert Baratheon, is a central figure in the political and historical landscape of Westeros. As the former ruler of the realm, his legacy and actions continue to influence events long after his death. He is remembered as a loud, often drunk, and boisterous king, yet also as a formidable warrior renowned for his prowess in tourneys and battles. His death, caused by wine served by Lancel Lannister, marked a turning point in Westeros, triggering significant political upheaval.\n\nKing Robert is the father of Tommen Baratheon and bears a striking resemblance to Gendry, a blacksmith’s apprentice, hinting at a possible paternal connection. His physical decline in later years is noted, particularly his weight gain, which made it difficult for him to wear his armor, though he still expressed a desire to fight in melees despite objections from Ned Stark and Ser Barristan Selmy. His death is often compared to that of Lord Tywin Lannister, underscoring the impact of his passing on the realm.\n\nIn life, King Robert was a decisive ruler who stripped Ronald Connington of his lordship and intervened to halt Gregor Clegane’s violent actions. His reign was marked by both strength and vulnerability, as seen in his deep emotional response to Bran Stark’s condition. He was also a figure invoked by Catelyn Stark in her demand for justice against Tyrion Lannister, and there were suggestions that Cersei Lannister might persuade him to preside over Tyrion’s trial.\n\nThe Brotherhood Without Banners continued to fight in his name, viewing him as a symbol of justice and a ruler who would not have tolerated the injustices plaguing Westeros. His memory is often referenced by characters, including an old man who laments that Robert would not have allowed the current state of affairs. His conversations with Ned Stark, particularly regarding Jon Arryn’s death, reveal his role in the intricate political dynamics of the time.\n\nKing Robert’s complex legacy—marked by his strengths, flaws, and the consequences of his death—continues to shape the fate of Westeros, making him a pivotal figure in its history.\",10\r\n1649,THE KNIGHTING,The knighting is a ceremony where Gendry is knighted by Beric Dondarrion,1\r\n859,LOMMY,\"Lommy is a companion of Arya Stark and a member of Yoren's group, a band of recruits traveling north to join the Night's Watch. He is known for his playful and sometimes confrontational behavior, as evidenced by an incident where he goes wading and throws mud at Hot Pie, another member of the group. Despite his youthful antics, Lommy also displays moments of pragmatism, such as suggesting that the group search an inn for food.\n\nHowever, Lommy is also characterized by his tendency to avoid conflict, frequently advocating for yielding or leaving Gendry behind to prevent confrontation. This cautious nature is contrasted by his involvement in a battle, where he fights alongside his companions. Unfortunately, Lommy is wounded during these events and is later found by Arya and her group as a survivor.\n\nTragically, Lommy's story ends when he is killed by a spearman, an act later attributed to Raff the Sweetling, a notorious figure among the group's enemies. His death marks a somber moment for Arya and the others, as he was one of their own, despite his occasional mocking behavior toward Arya. Lommy's complex personality—ranging from playful and pragmatic to conflict-averse—makes him a memorable figure in the group's journey.\",6\r\n1551,SHARNA,A character who owns or runs the inn where Hot Pie decides to stay,1\r\n1220,RAFF THE SWEETLING,\"Raff the Sweetling is a brutal and ruthless soldier known for his violent actions. He is infamous for killing Lommy Greenhands and his mother as an act of punishment for defiance. This heinous act has earned him a place on Arya Stark’s list of people she seeks vengeance against. Despite his violent reputation, Raff is also tasked with military duties, including escorting notable figures such as Desmond Grell and Robin Ryger. His role as a soldier does not diminish his notoriety, as he remains closely associated with the death of Lommy Greenhands, further cementing his brutal legacy. Raff’s actions and the fear he instills make him a significant figure in the conflicts and personal vendettas of those affected by his cruelty.\",3\r\n1214,CHISWYCK,\"Chiswyck is a brutal and sadistic man associated with Ser Gregor Clegane’s group, known for his cruel behavior and participation in heinous acts. He is described as a man who physically abuses captives, finding amusement in his violence, and is particularly infamous for his role in the rape of a brewer’s daughter. Chiswyck serves as an assistant to the Tickler, another torturer, and actively participates in harming prisoners, including Arya Stark. His threats extend to others, such as Hot Pie, further demonstrating his menacing nature.\n\nDespite his actions, Arya Stark initially considers him irrelevant to her personal vendetta, though he later becomes a significant figure in her quest for vengeance. She contemplates naming him to Jaqen H’ghar, a Faceless Man capable of killing those she chooses. Ultimately, Arya whispers Chiswyck’s name to Jaqen, resulting in his death. His inclusion on Arya’s list of people she wants dead underscores his role as a symbol of the cruelty she endured and seeks to avenge. Chiswyck’s demise serves as a pivotal moment in Arya’s journey, marking one of her first steps toward retribution against those who wronged her and her family.\",4\r\n297,STREET OF STEEL,A street in King’s Landing where the armorer Tobho Mott's house is located,1\r\n298,TOBHO MOTT,\"Tobho Mott is a master armorer and smith renowned for his exceptional craftsmanship, residing in a house on the Street of Steel. He is particularly noted for his expertise in working with Valyrian steel, a rare and highly prized material in the world of Westeros. Mott’s skills extend beyond ordinary blacksmithing, as he has demonstrated the ability to rework and forge Valyrian steel, a task few can accomplish.\n\nMott’s involvement with Gendry, a young blacksmith and bastard son of King Robert Baratheon, is a significant part of his story. He took Gendry as an apprentice, though the circumstances surrounding this apprenticeship were somewhat suspicious. Some speculate that Mott may have been aware of Gendry’s true lineage or had ulterior motives for training him. Eventually, Mott sent Gendry to join the Night’s Watch, a decision that altered the young man’s fate.\n\nDespite the ambiguity surrounding his actions, Tobho Mott remains a respected figure in his trade, known for both his skill and his connections to important events and individuals in Westeros. His work with Valyrian steel and his role in Gendry’s life highlight his influence as a master craftsman.\",5\r\n299,THE KNIGHT OF FLOWERS,A person who buys armor from Tobho Mott,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1694,HOT PIE,ARYA,\"Hot Pie and Arya are two characters who share a notable interaction during their journey. Arya, a young and determined individual, is accompanied by Hot Pie when they are discovered by Tom of Sevenstreams and his men. During their time together, Hot Pie demonstrates concern for Arya’s safety, particularly in the face of potential threats such as wolves. He insists that she stay close to the camp, taking on a protective role.\n\nTheir relationship is marked by moments of camaraderie and mutual support. At one point, Hot Pie asks Arya about her sword, showing interest in her skills and preparedness.
