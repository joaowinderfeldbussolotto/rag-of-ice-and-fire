A skilled military leader, Robb achieves significant victories, including outmaneuvering Tywin Lannister’s forces and securing a triumph at Riverrun.

His actions, including beheading Rickard Karstark for killing prisoners, demonstrate his strict sense of justice but also strain his alliances.\n\nRobb’s relationships are complex; he is a friend to Theon Greyjoy but later becomes a threat to him. He is suspicious of Tyrion Lannister and hosts members of the Night’s Watch. His mother, Catelyn, acts as his envoy, negotiating peace between the Baratheon brothers.

The betrayal resulted in the deaths of many prominent figures, including Sansa Stark’s brother, Robb, and her mother, Catelyn. Additionally, men from House Bracken perished alongside Robb Stark, further illustrating the widespread devastation inflicted upon the northern Houses.\n\nMerrett Frey, a member of House Frey, later claimed to have had no direct involvement in the plot, though his family played a central role in its execution.

It has been under siege multiple times, with Jaime Lannister attempting to secure control to suppress rebellion. Despite its resistance, the castle eventually yields under pressure, though it remains a symbol of defiance. Robb Stark, Catelyn’s son, uses Riverrun as a base of operations, holding court and negotiating with envoys, while also marshaling forces to defend against Lannister invasions. The castle is where Robb leaves his wife and where his forces defeat Jaime Lannister’s army, marking a significant victory.\n\nRiverrun is also a destination for several characters.

His duties suggest he is a reliable and diligent worker, contributing to the daily operations of the camp by ensuring meals are ready. While his exact background or additional responsibilities are not detailed, his presence highlights the structured and functional nature of Catelyn Stark's camp, where even servants play a crucial role in maintaining order and sustenance.\",1\r\n592,SER WENDEL MANDERLY,\"Ser Wendel Manderly is a knight of House Manderly, a prominent noble house from the North. He is known for his loyalty and service to his family, as well as his role in accompanying Lady Catelyn Stark with a force of 1,500 men, demonstrating his leadership and military capabilities. Additionally, Ser Wendel is noted for his practical and resourceful nature, as evidenced by his suggestion to supplement oats with roast quail, likely as a means to improve provisions or morale. His actions reflect both his martial prowess and his consideration for the well-being of those under his command. As a member of House Manderly, he upholds the values and traditions of his house while contributing to the broader political and military efforts of the North.\",1\r\n1136,COLEN OF GREENPOOLS,Colen of Greenpools is a knight who intercepts Catelyn Stark's party,1\r\n1137,BITTERBRIDGE,\"Bitterbridge is a significant location in the political and military landscape of Westeros, particularly during the War of the Five Kings. Situated where the Roseroad crosses the Mander, it serves as a strategic point for travel and conflict. The town is notably the site of Renly Baratheon’s camp, where a portion of his forces remained stationed even after his death. This makes Bitterbridge a key location for Renly’s lingering influence and military presence.\n\nPolitically, Bitterbridge holds importance as the place where Catelyn Stark met with Renly Baratheon in an attempt to negotiate an alliance against the Lannisters. The discussions here underscore the town’s role in the broader power struggles of the realm. Additionally, Parmen Crane, a knight loyal to Renly, was sent to Bitterbridge, further emphasizing its connection to Renly’s faction.\n\nThe town is also marked by notable events, including a mêlée where Brienne of Tarth took revenge on false suitors who had mocked her. This incident highlights Bitterbridge as a place of both martial contests and personal vendettas. The combination of its strategic location, political negotiations, and military significance cements Bitterbridge as a pivotal site in the conflicts and intrigues of the era. Its involvement in key moments of the war and its role as a gathering point for Renly’s forces make it a location of enduring importance.\",1\r\n1300,HAL MOLLEN,Hal Mollen is a person dicing with others in Catelyn's camp,1\r\n1134,LUCAS BLACKWOOD,\"Lucas Blackwood is a nobleman and warrior from the North, known for his association with House Stark. He accompanied Catelyn Stark on her mission, serving as a loyal and trusted member of her party. During their journey, Lucas was observed sharpening his dagger in Catelyn's camp, demonstrating his preparedness and martial skills. Despite his noble status and combat readiness, Lucas Blackwood met a tragic end when he was killed by Hosteen Frey during the infamous massacre at the Red Wedding. His death underscores the brutal and unforgiving nature of the conflict between the Starks and their enemies, marking him as one of the many casualties in the struggle for power in the North.\",1\r\n475,RED FORK,\"The Red Fork is a significant river in the realm, playing a crucial role in various military and strategic operations. It is closely associated with House Tully, as it flows near Riverrun, their ancestral seat, and serves as a key defensive line where border holdfasts are maintained. During conflicts, the river has been a site of notable engagements, including a battle where Edmure Tully's forces successfully repelled the troops of Tywin Lannister, demonstrating its importance in regional defense.\n\nAdditionally, the Red Fork has been a target for supply train raids, further highlighting its strategic value in wartime logistics. The river also features in the movements of key figures, such as Jaime Lannister, whose boat was recorded traveling downstream along its waters. Its proximity to Riverrun and its influence on military strategies underscore its broader significance in the political and martial landscape of the region. The Red Fork thus stands as both a natural boundary and a critical asset in the power dynamics of the area.\",3\r\n567,GREATJON UMBER,\"Greatjon Umber is a prominent northern lord and the leader of House Umber, with uncles Mors and Hother Umber. Known for his fierce warrior spirit and immense strength, he is a key bannerman of House Stark. Initially, the Greatjon challenged Robb Stark’s authority but later became one of his most staunch and loyal supporters, playing a crucial role in proclaiming Robb as the King in the North. His unwavering loyalty to Robb Stark and House Stark is well-documented, as he actively supported Robb’s cause during the War of the Five Kings.\n\nAs a skilled commander, the Greatjon demonstrated his tactical prowess during battles, notably by ordering the firing of siege towers in a critical engagement. His reputation as a formidable warrior was such that Robb Stark once threatened to send him in place of Catelyn Stark, underscoring his fearsome nature. Despite his initial resistance to Robb’s leadership, the Greatjon’s eventual allegiance solidified his position as a vital ally to the Starks, reinforcing his role as a powerful and influential figure in the North. His leadership and combat skills made him an indispensable asset to Robb Stark’s campaign.\",3\r\n606,HOUSE FREY,\"House Frey is a noble family from the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, known for their strategic and often treacherous role in the conflicts of Westeros. Led by the cunning and opportunistic Lord Walder Frey, the house controls the Twins, a crucial crossing point over the Green Fork of the Trident, granting them significant political leverage.\n\nHouse Frey is deeply involved in the War of the Five Kings, initially aligning with Robb Stark after his levies follow him into battle. They participate in key sieges and conflicts, demonstrating their military engagement. However, their loyalty is notoriously unreliable, as they are quick to shift allegiances based on perceived advantage. This is evident in their resistance to Davos Seaworth’s plea for an alliance with Stannis Baratheon, as they prefer to wait and see the outcome of the war before committing.\n\nThe Freys are also known for their aggressive and violent tendencies, as seen in their conflicts with other noble houses, including House Manderly. Their involvement in marital negotiations with Robb Stark further highlights their political maneuvering, though these discussions ultimately lead to betrayal. The infamous Red Wedding, where they turn against the Starks in a brutal act of treachery, solidifies their reputation as ruthless and self-serving.\n\nDespite their military contributions, House Frey’s actions are often driven by self-interest rather than honor or loyalty. Their control over the Twins and their willingness to exploit their strategic position make them a formidable yet distrusted force in the realm. Their legacy is one of cunning, violence, and shifting allegiances, ensuring their place as one of the most notorious houses in Westeros.\",6\r\n2105,STONEHEART,\"A resurrected version of Catelyn Stark, leading the Brotherhood Without Banners\",4\r\n315,FREYS,\"House Frey is a noble family from the Riverlands, known for their significant influence and controversial actions during the War of the Five Kings. They are infamous for their betrayal at the Red Wedding, where they played a pivotal role in the massacre of Robb Stark and his forces, aligning themselves with House Bolton. This betrayal was partly motivated by Robb Stark’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which broke a prior marriage pact with the Freys, deepening their resentment.\n\nThe Freys hold considerable sway over Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, though their relationship is strained. They were responsible for the death of Ser Wendel Manderly during the sack of Winterfell and later brought his bones to the Manderlys, attempting to mend relations through proposed marriages. However, their past atrocities, including Wendel’s death, have left lasting enmity.\n\nAs advisors to Roose Bolton, the Freys believed in the inevitability of Robb Stark’s defeat and actively worked against the Northmen. They were involved in the siege of Riverrun and may have participated in attacks on Stannis Baratheon’s forces. Their presence in the North has been marked by tension, particularly after Edmure Tully’s return, which led some Frey members to depart.\n\nThe Freys are also known for their role in confirming the execution of Davos Seaworth, further solidifying their reputation as a ruthless and politically calculating house. Their bannermen and influence extend to various regions, including their involvement in the inn where key political discussions took place. Despite their power, their actions have earned them widespread distrust, particularly among the Northmen and other noble houses affected by their betrayals.\",12\r\n560,KARSTARKS,\"The Karstarks are a noble house from the North, sworn as bannermen to House Stark and known for their fierce nature. Led by Rickard Karstark, they share Stark blood and have historically been loyal allies of House Stark. The Karstarks arrived at Winterfell to join Robb Stark's army during the War of the Five Kings, demonstrating their allegiance to the Starks.\n\nHowever, their loyalty became complicated when they initially allied with Stannis Baratheon, who sought to claim the North. Despite this alliance, the Karstarks ultimately double-crossed Stannis by refusing to lead him into a trap at the Dreadfort, suggesting a shift in their allegiances or a strategic decision to avoid further conflict. This contradictory behavior highlights the complex political landscape of the North and the Karstarks' efforts to navigate it while maintaining their ties to House Stark.\n\nOverall, the Karstarks remain a significant and formidable house in the North, deeply connected to the Starks by blood and fealty, though their actions reflect the turbulent and shifting loyalties of the era.\",5\r\n916,STAFFORD LANNISTER,\"Ser Stafford Lannister is a prominent military leader of House Lannister, known for his role during the War of the Five Kings. As a seasoned commander, he was tasked with gathering and preparing forces at Casterly Rock, the ancestral seat of House Lannister, to bolster the Lannister war effort. His efforts included assembling a new host to reinforce Lannister strength in the Westerlands.\n\nHowever, Stafford Lannister's military campaigns ultimately met with defeat. He led a Lannister army that was crushed by Robb Stark, the young and formidable King in the North, at the Battle of Oxcross. This decisive battle resulted in the destruction of his levies, marking a significant setback for the Lannisters. Despite his preparations and strategic positioning, Stafford's forces were outmaneuvered by Robb Stark's superior tactics, leading to his downfall.\n\nStafford Lannister's role as a commander underscores the challenges faced by House Lannister during the conflict, as well as the rising threat posed by Robb Stark's military prowess. His defeat at Oxcross serves as a notable example of the shifting tides of war and the vulnerabilities of even well-prepared Lannister forces.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3456,LORD WALDER,TYRION,Tyrion describes Lord Walder as an ill-natured old lecher who planned the Red Wedding,233\r\n18,ROBB STARK,BRAN STARK,\"Robb Stark and Bran Stark are brothers, with Robb being the older of the two. As members of House Stark, they share a close familial bond, though their age difference positions Robb in a more protective and leadership-oriented role. The relationship between the brothers is marked by mutual respect and loyalty, typical of the Stark family values. While both are integral to the Stark lineage, Robb’s elder status often places him in a position of greater responsibility, particularly in matters concerning their family and the North.
