Robar is present in the throne room, indicating his close association with the royal household and his role in significant political and ceremonial events.\n\nHe accompanies Catelyn Stark to a village, suggesting his involvement in the affairs of House Stark and his willingness to support their endeavors. This act highlights his chivalrous nature and his commitment to those he serves. However, his life meets a tragic end when he is killed by Loras Tyrell, a fellow knight, under circumstances that underscore the volatile and dangerous environment of the court.\n\nRobar is also known for his participation in a daring and somewhat reckless act—juggling daggers—after being goaded into it. This detail adds depth to his character, portraying him as both a skilled warrior and someone who can be provoked into displays of bravado. His death at the hands of Loras Tyrell further emphasizes the tensions and rivalries within the knightly orders and the broader political landscape.\n\nIn summary, Ser Robar Royce is a complex figure: a loyal knight of the Rainbow Guard, a companion to Catelyn Stark, and a victim of the deadly intrigues of the court. His story reflects the dangers and honor-bound conflicts that define the world he inhabits.\",5\r\n1158,BRYCE CARON,\"Bryce Caron is a nobleman and commander in Renly Baratheon's army, known for his leadership and strategic role within the forces.

His background as a former lord and his continued involvement in military affairs underscore his enduring relevance in the political and martial landscape. Whether through direct command or indirect influence, Bryce Caron remains a figure of consequence, shaping events through both his authority and his provocative nature.\",3\r\n1477,PHILIP FOOTE,Elevated to lordship after receiving lands from Bryce Caron,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3564,JAIME,OATHKEEPER,Jaime gives Brienne the Valyrian sword Oathkeeper,95\r\n258,RENLY BARATHEON,KINGSGUARD,Renly Baratheon is a member of the royal family and a knight,89\r\n2570,HOUSE PENROSE,RENLY BARATHEON,House Penrose supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,58\r\n2194,RENLY BARATHEON,ROSE ROAD,Renly Baratheon is moving his army up the Roseroad,57\r\n2566,HOUSE ROWAN,RENLY BARATHEON,House Rowan supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2568,HOUSE CARON,RENLY BARATHEON,House Caron supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2572,HOUSE FOSSOWAY,RENLY BARATHEON,House Fossoway supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2573,HOUSE CUY,RENLY BARATHEON,House Cuy supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2574,HOUSE MULLENDORE,RENLY BARATHEON,House Mullendore supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2575,HOUSE ESTERMONT,RENLY BARATHEON,House Estermont supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2576,HOUSE SELMY,RENLY BARATHEON,House Selmy supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2577,HOUSE HIGHTOWER,RENLY BARATHEON,House Hightower supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2578,HOUSE OAKHEART,RENLY BARATHEON,House Oakheart supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2579,HOUSE CRANE,RENLY BARATHEON,House Crane supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2580,HOUSE CASWELL,RENLY BARATHEON,House Caswell supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2581,HOUSE BLACKBAR,RENLY BARATHEON,House Blackbar supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2582,HOUSE MORRIGEN,RENLY BARATHEON,House Morrigen supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2583,HOUSE BEESBURY,RENLY BARATHEON,House Beesbury supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2584,HOUSE SHERMER,RENLY BARATHEON,House Shermer supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2585,HOUSE DUNN,RENLY BARATHEON,House Dunn supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2586,HOUSE FOOTLY,RENLY BARATHEON,House Footly supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2587,HOUSE FLORENT,RENLY BARATHEON,House Florent supports Renly Baratheon's claim to the throne,57\r\n2591,RENLY BARATHEON,ELDON ESTERMONT,Eldon Estermont is a commander in Renly's army,57\r\n2593,RENLY BARATHEON,GUYARD THE GREEN,Guyard the Green is a knight in Renly's service,57\r\n2634,RENLY BARATHEON,ONION KNIGHT,Renly mentions the Onion Knight in the context of the siege of Storm's End,57\r\n2300,RENLY,MATHIS ROWAN,Mathis Rowan is seated next to Catelyn at Renly's feast,52\r\n2301,RENLY,JON FOSSOWAY,Ser Jon Fossoway is present at Renly's feast,50\r\n2288,HOUSE TARTH,BRIENNE OF TARTH,\"Brienne of Tarth is a member of House Tarth\nBrienne is a member of House Tarth\",13\r\n2735,CORTNAY PENROSE,EDRIC STORM,Cortnay Penrose fears for Edric Storm's safety,12\r\n2290,SER LORAS TYRELL,A TOURNEY MELEE,Ser Loras Tyrell participates in the tourney melee,11\r\n2291,BRIENNE OF TARTH,SELWYN THE EVENSTAR,Brienne is the daughter of Selwyn the Evenstar,10\r\n2598,ROBAR ROYCE,YOHN ROYCE,Robar Royce is the son of Yohn Royce,9\r\n2314,BRYCE CARON,ROBAR ROYCE,Lord Bryce Caron goads Ser Robar Royce into juggling daggers,8\r\n2986,PHILIP FOOTE,BRYCE CARON,Philip Foote is granted the lands of Bryce Caron,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
