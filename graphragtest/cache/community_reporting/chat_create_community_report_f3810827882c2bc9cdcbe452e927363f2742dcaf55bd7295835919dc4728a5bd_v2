She is notably known for her tragic experiences and her connection to Tyrion Lannister. During the riot in King’s Landing, Lollys was brutally raped by fifty men, an ordeal she survived but which left her deeply traumatized. Despite her suffering, she was later found alive, though her mental state remained fragile.\n\nLollys was once considered a potential match for Tyrion Lannister, though her intellectual limitations and the aftermath of her assault likely rendered such a union improbable. Her life took another significant turn when she bore a bastard son, whom Bronn—acting on Tyrion’s behalf—named Tyrion in a gesture of mockery or perhaps twisted honor. This act further tied her fate to that of the Lannisters, albeit in an unconventional manner.\n\nAdditionally, Lollys was a woman of some means, as evidenced by the possibility of having Shae, a former camp follower turned maidservant, in her service. This detail underscores her noble status, despite her personal misfortunes. Her story is one of both tragedy and resilience, marked by the harsh realities of the world she inhabited and the enduring, if complicated, connections to powerful figures like Tyrion Lannister.\",2\r\n1385,LADY TANDA,\"Lady Tanda is a noblewoman known for her high social standing and the dramatic events surrounding her family.
