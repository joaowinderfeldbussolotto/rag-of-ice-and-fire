The event, referred to as the Battle of the Bells, marked a significant moment in Robert's Rebellion. Despite his efforts, Connington was unable to secure Robert Baratheon, who managed to evade capture during the battle. This failure had lasting consequences for Connington, as it contributed to his eventual downfall and exile. Stoney Sept, a town in the Riverlands, served as the backdrop for this critical confrontation, where the local populace played a role in thwarting Connington's plans by ringing the town's bells to warn of his presence.

The termination of this contract suggests a change in strategic priorities or unresolved disputes between the two parties. While the exact reasons for the dissolution of the contract remain unspecified, the action underscores the Golden Company's autonomy in managing their alliances and commitments. Myr, a notable city in Essos, may now need to seek alternative arrangements to fill the void left by the Golden Company's departure.
