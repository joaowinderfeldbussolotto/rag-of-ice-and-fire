He plays a significant role in the military and political affairs of his family, often involved in key decisions during the war. Edmure is known for his leadership, commanding the defense of Riverrun against formidable forces, including those led by Lord Tywin Lannister. Despite his efforts, his host was ultimately defeated under the walls of Riverrun, leading to his capture. Later, he is returned to Riverrun under negotiation, though his status remains precarious, as some, like Genna Lannister, suggest drastic measures such as his execution to resolve conflicts.\n\nEdmure is also notable for his personal connections, including his childhood friendship with Petyr Baelish, to whom he gave the nickname \"\"Littlefinger.\"\" His presence at significant events, such as the wedding at the Twins, where he is hastily asked to marry Roslin Frey, underscores his role in both family and political alliances. His return to Riverrun causes tension, particularly with the Freys, leading dozens to depart in protest.\n\nThroughout the war, Edmure interprets omens, such as the red comet, as signs of victory, reflecting his hopeful and determined nature. However, his relationship with his sister Catelyn is strained at times, particularly when he scolds her for freeing Jaime Lannister, highlighting their differing perspectives on strategy and loyalty. Despite these conflicts, Edmure remains a steadfast leader, advising Robb Stark on matters such as the handling of the Karstark situation. His actions and decisions are pivotal in shaping the outcomes of the war and the fate of his family.\",11\r\n1496,LORD BOLTON,Lord Bolton is informed by Edmure about Jaime's escape in hopes of capturing him at Harrenhal.,1\r\n1622,ROSIN FREY,\"Rosin Frey is a member of House Frey, a prominent noble family from the Twins in the Riverlands. She is noted for her involvement in significant political events during the War of the Five Kings. Rosin was proposed as a potential bride for Edmure Tully, a member of House Tully and the heir to Riverrun, suggesting her family's strategic interest in forging alliances through marriage.\n\nAdditionally, Rosin Frey is mentioned in a message from the Twins, which hints at her possible involvement in the infamous Red Wedding, the event where Robb Stark, King in the North, was betrayed and murdered. While her exact role in the conspiracy remains unclear, her association with the message suggests she may have played a part in the plot orchestrated by House Frey and their allies. This dual context—both as a proposed bride and a figure linked to a pivotal act of treachery—highlights her family's complex and often ruthless political maneuvering during the conflict.\",1\r\n1624,ROSLIN FREY,A person whom Edmure is asked to marry,1\r\n1696,ROSLIN,\"Roslin Frey, also known as Roslin, is the wife of Edmure Tully. She is described as a beautiful woman who became Edmure’s bride during a tumultuous period. Their wedding, part of the infamous Red Wedding, was marked by tragedy, as Roslin was carried away weeping during the bedding ceremony, a moment that underscored the sorrow and betrayal of the event. Despite the harrowing circumstances of their union, Roslin and Edmure’s marriage endured, and she later became pregnant with his child.\n\nFollowing the events of the Red Wedding, Roslin was taken to Casterly Rock, where she is being held, presumably as a political hostage or to ensure the compliance of House Tully. Her pregnancy adds a layer of complexity to her situation, as she remains under the control of House Lannister while carrying the heir of House Tully. Roslin’s role in the narrative is one of both tragedy and resilience, as she navigates the consequences of the political machinations that surrounded her marriage to Edmure. Her beauty and her status as Edmure’s wife and expectant mother make her a significant, if often overlooked, figure in the broader conflicts of the realm.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3023,EDMURE,LORD BOLTON,Edmure sends ravens to Lord Bolton about Jaime's escape in hopes of capturing him at Harrenhal,12\r\n3254,EDMURE,ROSIN FREY,\"Edmure Tully is proposed to marry Roslin Frey, indicating a potential marital relationship\",12\r\n3259,EDMURE,ROSLIN FREY,Edmure is asked to marry Roslin Frey immediately,12\r\n3366,EDMURE,ROSLIN,\"Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey are central figures in a significant political and familial union.

Following the wedding, Edmure and Roslin were married and are to be held at Casterly Rock, the seat of House Lannister. This suggests that their union may have broader political implications, possibly involving the Lannisters or other powerful factions in Westeros.
