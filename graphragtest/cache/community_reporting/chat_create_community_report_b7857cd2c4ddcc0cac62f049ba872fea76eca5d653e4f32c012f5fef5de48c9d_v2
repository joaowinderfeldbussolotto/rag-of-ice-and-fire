He accompanies Murch to investigate a ruined village and later assists in burying a woman, demonstrating his involvement in the group's activities. Cutjack is also known for his readiness to defend his companions, as seen when he pulls out his hammer in response to the threat posed by the gold cloaks. His actions reflect a sense of solidarity and loyalty, particularly when he stands with Arya by brandishing his hammer in her defense.\n\nHowever, Cutjack's loyalty is not absolute, as he is also described as a survivor who ultimately abandons Arya and her group, suggesting a prioritization of self-preservation over allegiance. Despite this, he is assigned responsibilities within the group, such as keeping watch from the towerhouse, indicating that he is trusted to some extent. His character is marked by a mix of bravery, practicality, and self-interest, making him a complex figure within Yoren's group.\",4\r\n287,GENDRY,\"Gendry is a young blacksmith and former apprentice with a notable resemblance to King Robert Baratheon, leading to widespread speculation that he may be the late king’s bastard son. His lineage grants him a special status, and he was once sought by Jon Arryn before his death. Gendry is a skilled blacksmith who forged his own distinctive bull helmet, which he often wears, and his expertise in the forge spared him from execution.\n\nInitially an apprentice armorer, Gendry traveled with Yoren’s group of recruits for the Night’s Watch, where he assisted in burying the one-armed woman and wore his signature helmet. He later became a companion of Arya Stark, forming a close bond with her and Hot Pie. Though he initially refused to help Arya, he eventually aided her in escaping Harrenhal after being captured by Gregor Clegane’s men. During their journey, Gendry proved loyal and protective, helping Arya and Hot Pie when they were discovered by Tom of Sevenstreams and his men.\n\nGendry’s journey with Arya included traveling to the Hollow Hill and fighting alongside her, where he demonstrated bravery by killing Biter with a spear. He also assisted in practical tasks, such as searching for boats and helping with cook duty. Despite his reluctance to participate in prayers, his presence was marked by his strong resemblance to King Robert, further fueling suspicions about his parentage.\n\nAfter parting ways with Arya, Gendry joined the Brotherhood Without Banners, where he was knighted by Beric Dondarrion. Known as \"\"the Bull\"\" and wanted by the queen, Gendry’s life is shaped by his skills, his uncertain lineage, and his unwavering loyalty to those he travels with. His story intertwines with Arya’s, making him a key figure in her journey.\",18\r\n124,KING ROBERT,\"King Robert, also known as King Robert Baratheon, is a central figure in the political and historical landscape of Westeros. As the former ruler of the realm, his legacy and actions continue to influence events long after his death. He is remembered as a loud, often drunk, and boisterous king, yet also as a formidable warrior renowned for his prowess in tourneys and battles. His death, caused by wine served by Lancel Lannister, marked a turning point in Westeros, triggering significant political upheaval.\n\nKing Robert is the father of Tommen Baratheon and bears a striking resemblance to Gendry, a blacksmith’s apprentice, hinting at a possible paternal connection. His physical decline in later years is noted, particularly his weight gain, which made it difficult for him to wear his armor, though he still expressed a desire to fight in melees despite objections from Ned Stark and Ser Barristan Selmy. His death is often compared to that of Lord Tywin Lannister, underscoring the impact of his passing on the realm.\n\nIn life, King Robert was a decisive ruler who stripped Ronald Connington of his lordship and intervened to halt Gregor Clegane’s violent actions. His reign was marked by both strength and vulnerability, as seen in his deep emotional response to Bran Stark’s condition. He was also a figure invoked by Catelyn Stark in her demand for justice against Tyrion Lannister, and there were suggestions that Cersei Lannister might persuade him to preside over Tyrion’s trial.\n\nThe Brotherhood Without Banners continued to fight in his name, viewing him as a symbol of justice and a ruler who would not have tolerated the injustices plaguing Westeros. His memory is often referenced by characters, including an old man who laments that Robert would not have allowed the current state of affairs. His conversations with Ned Stark, particularly regarding Jon Arryn’s death, reveal his role in the intricate political dynamics of the time.\n\nKing Robert’s complex legacy—marked by his strengths, flaws, and the consequences of his death—continues to shape the fate of Westeros, making him a pivotal figure in its history.\",10\r\n1649,THE KNIGHTING,The knighting is a ceremony where Gendry is knighted by Beric Dondarrion,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1689,CUTJACK,ARYA,Cutjack shows solidarity with Arya by pulling out a hammer,149\r\n483,GENDRY,NED,Ned asks to see Gendry and notices his resemblance to Robert,113\r\n3109,KING ROBERT,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,The Brotherhood Without Banners fights in the name of King Robert,22\r\n3296,GENDRY,THE KNIGHTING,Gendry is knighted during the knighting event,19\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
