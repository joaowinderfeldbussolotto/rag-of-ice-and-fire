She is notably mentioned as a potential bride for Tyrion Lannister, a prospect that is used as a threat or a means of coercion by Tywin Lannister, Tyrion’s father. Her name is brought up in discussions regarding Tyrion’s marriage, suggesting that the union would be undesirable or punitive in nature.\n\nAdditionally, Lollys is known to be the fiancée of Bronn, a skilled sellsword and later a knight in service to House Lannister. This relationship adds another layer to her significance in the political and social dynamics of the realm. Her presence is also noted at a tourney, indicating her participation in high-profile events and her family’s standing in noble circles.\n\nWhile details about her personality or appearance are sparse, her role in the narrative highlights the strategic and often harsh nature of marital alliances in the world of Westeros. Whether as a potential bride for Tyrion or as Bronn’s betrothed, Lollys Stokeworth serves as a figure tied to the broader political maneuverings of powerful houses.\",2\r\n339,BRONN,\"Bronn is a complex and multifaceted character in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, primarily known as a sellsword and loyal companion to Tyrion Lannister. Initially a mercenary, Bronn is hired to guard Tyrion during his journey to the Eyrie, showcasing his combat skills and pragmatic outlook. Over time, he becomes a trusted ally and captain of Tyrion’s guard, known for his blunt manner, ferocity in battle, and unwavering loyalty—though often motivated by profit.\n\nBronn’s relationship with Tyrion is central to his role, as he serves as a messenger, bodyguard, and enforcer. He delivers urgent messages, arms Tyrion with a double-bladed axe, and fights alongside him in critical battles. His loyalty is tested when he refuses to stand as Tyrion’s champion in certain situations, yet he ultimately proves his dedication by winning Tyrion’s trial-by-combat against Ser Vardis Egen, securing Tyrion’s freedom. Later, he is knighted by the Lannisters, adopting the title *Ser Bronn of the Blackwater*, and becomes involved in political and military actions, including triggering the wildfire trap against Stannis’ fleet during the Battle of the Blackwater.\n\nDespite his allegiance to Tyrion, Bronn is also a figure of suspicion, particularly by Cersei Lannister, who questions his motives and suspects him of hiding Tyrion or gathering forces against her. He is implicated in Cersei’s payments to the Kettleblacks, which secretly align Osmund Kettleblack with Tyrion’s interests. Bronn’s actions often blur the lines between loyalty and self-interest, as seen when he finds Shae for Tyrion and carries out orders, such as the execution of Symon Silvertongue and threats against Ser Boros.\n\nBronn’s character is defined by his combat prowess, survival instincts, and involvement in both courtly and military matters. He is a key player in Tyrion’s schemes, offering security, support, and strategic advice. His journey from a simple sellsword to a knighted warrior reflects his adaptability and ambition, making him one of the most dynamic figures in Tyrion’s circle.\",25\r\n428,SELLSWORD,\"A sellsword is a mercenary, a term used to describe individuals who offer their combat skills in exchange for payment, often without long-term allegiance to any particular cause or employer. This term is notably associated with several characters and groups in various contexts.\n\nSer Jorah Mormont, a knight from Westeros, became a sellsword after fleeing to Lys, where he took up the life of a mercenary. His transition to this role followed his exile and the loss of his former status, leading him to seek employment through martial prowess. Similarly, Bronn, another prominent figure, is referred to as a sellsword. He begins as a mercenary but later becomes a key ally and champion to Tyrion Lannister, demonstrating the fluid nature of such relationships.\n\nSellswords are not limited to individual fighters; they can also form part of larger mercenary companies. These groups may operate under contracts but are known for their pragmatic approach, sometimes abandoning their paymasters if circumstances change, such as the destruction of slavers or other shifts in power dynamics. Their loyalty is often tied to payment rather than ideology, making them adaptable but unreliable in the long term.\n\nThe concept of sellswords highlights the transient and often opportunistic nature of mercenary work, where personal gain frequently outweighs loyalty. Whether as lone fighters like Bronn or as part of organized companies, sellswords play significant roles in conflicts, offering their services to the highest bidder or the most advantageous cause.\",3\r\n1381,KETTLEBLACKS,\"The Kettleblacks are a family or group of brothers prominently associated with Oswell Kettleblack, who is revealed to be their father. This family plays a significant role in the political and military affairs of Westeros, particularly in the service of House Lannister. The Kettleblacks are known for their involvement in raising sellswords, working closely with Cersei Lannister to bolster her forces and influence. Initially, they were a group of knights who served under Tyrion Lannister, but they are no longer under his command, having shifted their allegiance. Their actions and loyalties reflect the complex and often treacherous dynamics of power in the realm, as they navigate their roles within the intricate web of alliances and betrayals that define the era. The Kettleblacks are thus a notable example of how familial ties and opportunism intersect in the pursuit of power and survival in Westeros.\",3\r\n340,CHIGGEN,\"Chiggen is a sellsword whose actions and fate are mentioned in various contexts. He is notably known for butchering Tyrion Lannister’s horse, an act that added to Tyrion’s grievances against the Starks. This incident highlights Chiggen’s role as a mercenary with little regard for the property or status of others. Additionally, Chiggen is referenced by Bronn, who mentions that Chiggen had \"\"better things to do than pile rocks,\"\" suggesting a dismissive or pragmatic attitude toward menial tasks.\n\nChiggen’s life came to a violent end when he was killed by Bronn after being wounded in an attack. His death is discussed in the context of survival, emphasizing the brutal and unforgiving nature of the world in which he operated. Despite his aggressive and self-serving actions, Chiggen ultimately met his demise at the hands of another sellsword, underscoring the perilous existence of those in his profession. His story serves as a reminder of the fleeting and often violent lives led by mercenaries in a conflict-ridden society.\",1\r\n457,SER VARDIS,Ser Vardis is a knight who fought in a trial by combat against Bronn and was defeated,1\r\n395,VARDIS EGEN,\"Ser Vardis Egen was a knight in service to Lady Lysa Arryn at the Eyrie. Known for his loyalty and martial prowess, he served as a key figure in Lysa’s court. His tenure as a knight came to a dramatic end when he was killed by Bronn, a skilled sellsword, in a trial by combat. The duel, which took place at the Eyrie, was a pivotal moment that showcased Bronn’s cunning and combat abilities, ultimately leading to Vardis Egen’s defeat and death. Despite his demise, Ser Vardis Egen is remembered as a dutiful knight who met his fate in the service of his lady.\",1\r\n2042,SER BALMAN,\"Husband of Falyse Stokeworth, killed by Bronn\",1\r\n430,SER VARDIS EGEN,\"Ser Vardis Egen is a knight who serves as Lysa Arryn’s champion in a trial-by-combat. Chosen to represent her in the duel, he faces Bronn, the skilled and cunning sellsword who fights on behalf of Tyrion Lannister. Despite his knighthood and formal training, Ser Vardis is ultimately defeated and killed by Bronn during the trial. His role in the duel is significant, as it underscores the contrast between traditional knightly combat and Bronn’s unorthodox, ruthless fighting style. Ser Vardis Egen’s death marks a pivotal moment in the conflict, highlighting the shifting dynamics of power and justice in the realm.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n776,TYRION LANNISTER,THE DUEL,The duel determines Tyrion’s fate,101\r\n3144,TYWIN,LOLLYS STOKEWORTH,\"Lollys Stokeworth is a potential bride for Tyrion, used as a threat by Tywin\",54\r\n732,BRONN,SELLSWORD,Bronn is identified as a sellsword who becomes Tyrion's champion,28\r\n2760,KETTLEBLACKS,BRONN,\"Bronn is matching Cersei's payments to the Kettleblacks, making Osmund secretly loyal to Tyrion\",28\r\n578,BRONN,CHIGGEN,\"Bronn and Chiggen are two characters whose relationship is marked by a significant past event. Bronn, known for his pragmatic survival instincts, killed Chiggen, suggesting a moment of conflict or necessity in their history. Despite this, Bronn later reflects on Chiggen, acknowledging that he had \"\"better things to do than pile rocks,\"\" hinting at a sense of respect or nostalgia for Chiggen’s character or choices. This contrast between their violent past and Bronn’s reflective remark paints a complex dynamic between the two, where survival and personal regard intersect. The details imply that Chiggen may have been a figure of some significance, whether as a rival, acquaintance, or even a former ally, whose memory lingers in Bronn’s mind.
