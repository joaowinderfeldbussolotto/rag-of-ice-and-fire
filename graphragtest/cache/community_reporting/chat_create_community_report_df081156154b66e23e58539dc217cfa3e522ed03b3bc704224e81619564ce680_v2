They are a fiercely independent people, organized into khalasars—mobile war bands—led by powerful leaders known as khals. Among their notable leaders is Khal Drogo, who is seen as a formidable threat to neighboring realms. The Dothraki follow strict leadership traditions, with khals commanding absolute loyalty from their followers, including elite warriors known as bloodriders.\n\nTheir culture is deeply rooted in warfare and tradition, with rituals such as the stallion heart ceremony, where a young warrior must consume the raw heart of a stallion to prove their strength. The Dothraki are also known for their dietary preferences, particularly their consumption of horse meat. They engage in slavery and warfare as part of their way of life, often expanding their influence through conquest.\n\nThe Dothraki have significant interactions with key figures in the broader political landscape. Viserys Targaryen once sought an alliance with them, while Daenerys Targaryen became closely associated with the Dothraki after marrying Khal Drogo. They gifted her with treasures and followed her leadership, though their alliance with her has since waned, leaving them absent from Meereen. Despite this, a khalasar is reported to be approaching Selhorys, indicating their continued movement and influence.\n\nTheir society is guided by omens and traditions, such as following the red comet, which they interpret as a sign of destiny. The Dothraki remain a formidable and enigmatic force, shaping the fate of the lands they traverse through their strength, rituals, and unyielding warrior ethos.\",12\r\n43,PENTOS,\"Pentos is a prominent Free City in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, playing a significant role in the political and personal narratives of several key characters. It is the city where Daenerys Targaryen and her brother Viserys resided under the hospitality of Illyrio Mopatis, a wealthy and influential magister. Pentos holds deep significance in Daenerys' life, as it is where she was prepared for her marriage to Khal Drogo, with the wedding taking place in the city. However, Daenerys harbors strong feelings about Pentos, refusing to return as a beggar, which reflects her pride and determination.\n\nThe city is also a hub of political intrigue and strategic importance. Illyrio Mopatis, a native of Pentos, operates from there, orchestrating alliances and deals that shape the broader conflicts in the series. Pentos is mentioned as a potential reward for the Tattered Prince in negotiations involving Quentyn Martell, highlighting its value as a bargaining chip in the struggle for power. Additionally, Varys and Illyrio are known to have operated in Pentos, further emphasizing its role in the shadowy dealings of the realm.\n\nPentos serves as a crucial location for other characters as well. Tyrion Lannister is smuggled out to the city after fleeing across the Narrow Sea, where he assumes the alias Hugor Hill. The city is also where Strong Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard escort Daenerys, reinforcing its connection to her journey. Furthermore, Pentos is mentioned in the context of the warlocks, including Pyat Pree, who sailed from the city, adding to its mystique and importance in the broader narrative.\n\nOverall, Pentos is a city of great political, personal, and strategic significance, intertwined with the fates of Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and other key figures in the series. Its role as a Free City, a center of intrigue, and a place of refuge and negotiation makes it a vital location in the unfolding events of the story.\",7\r\n131,IRRI,\"**Summary of Irri:**\n\nIrri is a Dothraki handmaiden who serves Daenerys Targaryen in various capacities.

Irri is known for her willingness to please Daenerys, including sexually, and also serves as a translator, bridging communication gaps. Gifted to Daenerys to teach her riding, Irri plays a role in her education and adaptation to Dothraki life.\n\nBeyond personal service, Irri takes on practical duties, such as carrying one of Daenerys' dragons in a cage and being sent to the market to procure food other than horse meat.
