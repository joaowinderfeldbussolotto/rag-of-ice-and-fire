Known for its strategic and nearly impregnable location, it can house up to 500 men and is the residence of Lysa Arryn, who governs the region alongside her son, Robert Arryn. The castle is renowned for its dramatic setting, overlooking a waterfall, and its harsh conditions during winter, which often force its inhabitants to retreat to the more hospitable Gates of the Moon.\n\nThe Eyrie plays a significant role in the political and personal narratives of several key figures. It is where Sansa Stark, under the alias Alayne, resides for a time, alongside Petyr Baelish, who manipulates events from within its walls. The fortress also becomes a place of captivity, holding both Tyrion Lannister in the infamous sky cells and the singer Marillion, whose songs once echoed through its halls. Additionally, Sandor Clegane plans to ransom Arya Stark to Lady Lysa at the Eyrie, though this scheme never comes to fruition.\n\nThe castle is a hub of intrigue and conflict, notably serving as the base for the Lords Declarant, who challenge Petyr Baelish’s influence over the Vale. It is also where Catelyn Stark visits her sister Lysa, who later sends ravens from the Eyrie to communicate with the wider realm. The fortress’s isolation and defensive strength make it a symbol of House Arryn’s power, though its remoteness also contributes to its political and social detachment from the rest of Westeros.\",6\r\n33,LYSA ARRYN,\"Lysa Arryn is a prominent noblewoman and the Lady of the Eyrie, ruling over the Vale. She is the widow of Jon Arryn, the former Hand of the King, and is known to have heard his last words before his death. Lysa is the sister of Catelyn Stark, making her the aunt of Robb, Sansa, and other Stark children. Despite her familial ties, she refuses to support Robb Stark’s cause, distancing herself from the political conflicts of the realm.\n\nLysa is the mother of Robert Arryn, a sickly boy whom she fiercely protects, often keeping him secluded in the Eyrie due to her paranoia. She is a figure of significant authority in the Vale, involved in both marital and political discussions, and was once considered as a potential bride for Jaime Lannister by Tywin Lannister. Additionally, she is rumored to be marshalling her forces alongside Stannis Baratheon, though her true allegiances remain ambiguous.\n\nLysa plays a crucial role in the trial and judgment of Tyrion Lannister, whom she accuses of murdering her husband, Jon Arryn. She holds Tyrion captive in the Eyrie, though she later aids in his escape, a decision that aligns with her complex and often contradictory nature. She is also mentioned in relation to a terrible accusation, possibly tied to her involvement in Jon Arryn’s death or other political intrigues.\n\nA figure of influence and secrecy, Lysa is known to have shared confidential information with the Starks, though her relationship with Cersei Lannister is hostile. She is described as a potential ally by Maester Cressen, though her unpredictable behavior makes her a volatile figure in the political landscape. Lysa is also noted for providing Tyrion and Bronn with provisions during their captivity, showcasing her dual nature of hostility and occasional hospitality.\n\nUltimately, Lysa Arryn meets a mysterious and untimely death, leaving her son Robert as the Lord of the Vale under the guardianship of Petyr Baelish, whom she had insisted on marrying. Her legacy is one of power, paranoia, and political maneuvering, marking her as a significant yet tragic figure in the history of the Vale.\",17\r\n387,NESTOR ROYCE,\"Lord Nestor Royce is a prominent nobleman in the Vale, known for his significant role in the region's political affairs. As a high-ranking noble, he previously served as High Steward under Jon Arryn, demonstrating his loyalty and administrative capabilities. Following the death of Lysa Arryn, Lord Nestor took an active role in investigating her murder, showcasing his dedication to justice and the stability of the Vale. His efforts and standing within the nobility were later rewarded when he was granted the Gates of the Moon, a strategic and prestigious stronghold, further solidifying his influence and authority in the region. Lord Nestor Royce is thus recognized as a key figure in the Vale, respected for his service and leadership.\",3\r\n391,GATES OF THE MOON,\"The Gates of the Moon is a significant castle located in the Vale, serving multiple strategic and residential purposes. Situated near the Eyrie, it acts as a more accessible base for the household during winter, providing a practical retreat from the harsh conditions of the higher mountain fortress. The castle is positioned at the base of the mountain leading to the Eyrie, making it a crucial point of entry and control for the region.\n\nOriginally, the Gates of the Moon was granted to Nestor Royce by Petyr Baelish, serving as a secondary castle under his authority. This transfer of control highlights its importance in the political and military landscape of the Vale. The castle has also been a focal point in conflicts, notably when it was blockaded by the Lords Declarant, who sought to limit access to the Eyrie. This blockade underscores its role as a key defensive and logistical asset in the region.\n\nIn summary, the Gates of the Moon is a vital stronghold in the Vale, functioning as a winter retreat, a strategic entry point to the Eyrie, and a castle of political significance under the governance of Nestor Royce. Its proximity to the Eyrie and its role in regional conflicts further emphasize its importance in the broader context of the Vale's defenses and administration.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n768,THE EYRIE,CATELYN,\"Catelyn is present at the Eyrie, where she witnesses events and makes decisions\",99\r\n46,LYSA ARRYN,NED STARK,Lysa Arryn is Ned Stark's sister-in-law and Catelyn's sister,69\r\n3784,NESTOR ROYCE,GATES OF THE MOON,Nestor Royce was granted hereditary lordship over the Gates of the Moon,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
