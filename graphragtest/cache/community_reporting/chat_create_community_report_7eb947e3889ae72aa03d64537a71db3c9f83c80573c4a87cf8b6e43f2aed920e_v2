A mentor and foster father to both Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, he played a crucial role in shaping their lives and the political landscape of the Seven Kingdoms. Jon Arryn was instrumental in ending Robert’s Rebellion, fighting at the Trident, and later helping to negotiate an end to a conspiracy involving House Martell. He was also known for his role in recommending Cersei Lannister as Robert’s wife, though this decision later contributed to his downfall.\n\nJon Arryn’s death was shrouded in mystery and intrigue, becoming a central event in the political conflicts that followed. Initially, his death was attributed to natural causes, but it was later revealed that he was poisoned by Cersei Lannister after discovering her incestuous relationship with Jaime and the true lineage of her children. His investigations into Robert’s bastards, particularly Gendry, and his suspicions about Cersei’s secrets are believed to have led to his murder. Littlefinger, who was deeply involved in the conspiracy, orchestrated the poisoning with Lysa Arryn’s unwitting assistance, further complicating the political fallout.\n\nJon Arryn’s death sparked unrest in the Vale and beyond, as his lineage and the question of succession became critical. His son, Robin Arryn, was considered for the position of Warden of the East, though Lysa’s overprotective nature and political maneuvering complicated matters. Ned Stark, Jon Arryn’s foster son, took up the investigation into his death, uncovering the truth about Cersei’s treachery and the broader conspiracy that threatened the realm.

Despite his wisdom and experience, Pycelle is often viewed with suspicion, particularly by figures like Eddard Stark, who does not trust him, and Tyrion Lannister, who accuses him of betrayal and punishes him for his actions.\n\nPycelle plays a key role in major events, such as informing Ned Stark about Robert Baratheon’s mortal wound and the progression of his condition. He also discusses Jon Arryn’s death with Ned, though he later confesses to involvement in it, further complicating his reputation. His political maneuvering is evident in his interactions with Cersei, whom he often opposes, particularly in decisions like sending Loras Tyrell on a mission. Cersei, in turn, accuses him of taking orders from Margaery Tyrell, highlighting the tensions within the court.\n\nAs a frequent visitor to Margaery Tyrell, Pycelle reveals her use of moon tea, adding to his role as a keeper of secrets. He is also a witness who testifies against Tyrion, though Tyrion taunts him with knowledge of a hidden secret, suggesting deeper layers of intrigue. Pycelle’s loyalty is questioned when he is accused of withholding news about Jon Arryn’s sisters and is later imprisoned during the political conflict between Tyrion and Cersei.\n\nDespite his advanced age, Pycelle remains active in governance, even temporarily governing the realm alongside Ser Harys Swyft.
