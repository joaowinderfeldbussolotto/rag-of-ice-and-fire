A nobleman of great honor and integrity, he played a pivotal role in the political landscape of Westeros. He was the father of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and Jon Snow, the latter being his acknowledged bastard. Eddard was also the husband of Catelyn Stark (nÃ©e Tully), with whom he fulfilled his late brother Brandonâ€™s betrothal.\n\nA key figure in Robertâ€™s Rebellion, Eddard Stark lifted the Siege of Stormâ€™s End and traveled through the Three Sisters, contributing significantly to Robert Baratheonâ€™s victory. He was known for his leadership and military prowess, credited with winning the Battle of the Bells. After the war, he found Jaime Lannister on the Iron Throne, witnessing the aftermath of the Mad Kingâ€™s death. Eddard later served as Hand of the King under Robert Baratheon, though his tenure was marked by political turmoil.\n\nEddard Stark was a man of principle, often at odds with the corruption of Kingâ€™s Landing. He discovered the truth about Cersei Lannisterâ€™s incestuous relationship with Jaime and the illegitimacy of her children, including Joffrey Baratheon. This revelation led to his arrest and eventual execution for treason, ordered by Joffrey. His death was a turning point in the War of the Five Kings, as his remains were mounted on a spike above the Red Keep, and his tomb was later placed in the vaults of Winterfell.\n\nEddard was also a figure of authority who took Theon Greyjoy as his ward and was known to punish those who broke the law, such as Ser Jorah Mormont, whom he forced to flee to Lys. His influence extended beyond his death, shaping the actions of those who knew him, including Theon and his own children. Despite his execution, his legacy endured as a symbol of honor and justice in Westeros.\",51\r\n306,ROBERT'S REBELLION,\"**Robert's Rebellion** was a major historical conflict that marked the downfall of House Targaryen and the end of the Dragonkings' reign. The rebellion was primarily led by several prominent houses, including House Stark, House Arryn, and House Baratheon, against the rule of Aerys II Targaryen, known as the Mad King. Key figures such as Eddard Stark, Robert Baratheon, Jon Arryn, and Howland Reed played pivotal roles in the uprising.\n\nThe conflict saw significant battles, including the decisive Battle of the Trident, where Rhaegar Targaryen, the heir to the Iron Throne, was slain. The rebellion also had far-reaching consequences for other houses, such as House Connington, which fell from power as a result. Tywin Lannister, though initially accused of cowardice for his delayed involvement, ultimately played a crucial role in the sack of Kingâ€™s Landing, securing victory for the rebels.\n\nNotable participants included Lyn Corbray, who fought alongside Jon Arryn, and Stannis Baratheon, whose actions during the war had lasting repercussions. The rebellion also involved the Lannisters and other houses, such as House Goodbrook, further illustrating the widespread opposition to Targaryen rule.\n\nEddard Stark, a central figure in the rebellion, traveled through the Three Sisters during the conflict and fought alongside Howland Reed, who would later become a key ally. The war culminated in the overthrow of the Targaryen dynasty, reshaping the political landscape of Westeros and establishing Robert Baratheon as the new king. The rebellion remains a defining moment in history, marking the transition from Targaryen rule to the reign of House Baratheon.\",8\r\n28,EXECUTION OF THE DESERTER,The execution of a deserter from the Night's Watch by Eddard Stark,2\r\n706,EXECUTION OF EDDARD STARK,Public beheading of Eddard Stark ordered by Joffrey,2\r\n1605,BATTLE OF THE BELLS,\"The Battle of the Bells is a significant historical conflict during Robert's Rebellion, marked by key events and notable figures. It is mentioned in the context of King Aerys II Targaryen's growing paranoia and desperation, as he sought to eliminate the rising threat posed by Robert Baratheon. The battle is particularly remembered for the failure of Jon Connington, a loyalist commander and Hand of the King, who was tasked with capturing or killing Robert Baratheon. Despite his efforts, Connington was unable to achieve his objective, leading to a decisive defeat.\n\nDuring the battle, Eddard Stark, a prominent leader among the rebels, played a crucial role in defeating Lord Connington's forces. This victory further solidified the momentum of the rebellion against the Targaryen regime. The Battle of the Bells is thus a pivotal moment in the war, highlighting both the strategic failures of the royalists and the growing strength of the rebel alliance. Jon Connington's inability to secure a victory or eliminate Robert Baratheon ultimately contributed to the downfall of House Targaryen and the eventual ascension of Robert Baratheon to the Iron Throne.\",2\r\n80,THE GREYJOY REBELLION,The Greyjoy Rebellion was a conflict in which House Greyjoy rebelled against the Iron Throne,1\r\n1606,LORD CONNINGTON,\"Lord Connington was the Hand of Aerys II Targaryen, defeated in the Battle of the Bells\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n12,EDDARD STARK,WINTERFELL,Eddard Stark is the Lord of Winterfell,109\r\n2253,ROBERT'S REBELLION,BRAN STARK,\"Bran Stark's father fought in Robert's Rebellion, a significant event in their family history\",67\r\n25,BRAN STARK,EXECUTION OF THE DESERTER,Bran Stark witnessed the execution of the deserter,61\r\n1340,JOFFREY,EXECUTION OF EDDARD STARK,Joffrey orders the execution of Eddard Stark,53\r\n3216,BATTLE OF THE BELLS,EDDARD STARK,Eddard Stark won the Battle of the Bells,53\r\n85,EDDARD STARK,THE GREYJOY REBELLION,Eddard Stark fought in the Greyjoy Rebellion alongside Robert Baratheon,52\r\n3217,LORD CONNINGTON,EDDARD STARK,Eddard Stark defeated Lord Connington in the Battle of the Bells,52\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
