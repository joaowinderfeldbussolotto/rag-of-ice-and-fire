He is the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane, with whom he shares a brutal reputation, though Sandor harbors a deep hatred for knights and the hypocrisy of chivalry. His face is severely scarred from a childhood incident in which Gregor burned him, a trauma that shapes his cynical and volatile personality. Despite his fearsome demeanor, he occasionally displays unexpected kindness, particularly toward Sansa Stark, whom he escorts and comforts after she is mistreated.\n\nThe Hound is a skilled fighter, defeating Ser Jaime Lannister in a joust and intervening to stop Gregor from killing Ser Loras Tyrell. His appointment to the Kingsguard is controversial, criticized by Tywin Lannister, yet he fulfills his duties, including protecting Sansa during riots and showing her rare moments of compassion. However, he is also responsible for the death of Mycah, the butcher’s boy, an act that earns him Arya Stark’s enmity and a place on her list of those she wishes dead.\n\nHis interactions with the Stark siblings are notable. He captures Arya Stark when she attempts to escape outlaws, initially planning to ransom her to Robb Stark but later accompanying her on her journey. He shares his disdain for killing and fear with Sansa, revealing a more introspective side beneath his hardened exterior. Despite his loyalty to Joffrey, he refuses to lead a sortie during the Battle of the Blackwater due to his fear of wildfire, showcasing his pragmatic and self-preserving nature.\n\nThe Hound’s relationship with his brother is fraught with violence and resentment, yet he remains a formidable presence in the political and martial conflicts of Westeros. His character is marked by contradictions—brutal yet capable of gentleness, loyal yet disillusioned, and feared yet deeply scarred, both physically and emotionally.\",20\r\n1456,KING'S GATE,\"**Summary of King's Gate**\n\nKing's Gate is a fortified entrance located in King's Landing, the capital city of the Seven Kingdoms.
