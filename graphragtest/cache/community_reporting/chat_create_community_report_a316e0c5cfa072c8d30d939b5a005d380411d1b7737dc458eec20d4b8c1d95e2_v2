His confrontational approach underscores his role as an enforcer of House Frey’s interests, often through force rather than diplomacy.\n\nOverall, Hosteen Frey is a complex figure—loyal to his family but prone to aggression, willing to take drastic measures to defend or advance House Frey’s position, even at the cost of escalating hostilities with other noble houses.\",3\r\n1074,HOUSE BOLTON,,2\r\n640,JARED FREY,\"Jared Frey is an envoy of House Frey and one of Lord Walder Frey’s sons. He is known to have accompanied Catelyn Stark during her interactions with House Frey, serving as a representative of his family. As a member of the extensive Frey lineage, Jared plays a role in the political and diplomatic affairs of his house, reflecting the influence and reach of House Frey in the Riverlands. His presence alongside Catelyn suggests he may have been involved in negotiations or discussions pertinent to the interests of his father and their house. While specific details about his personality or further actions are limited, his position as an envoy underscores his importance within the family structure.\",1\r\n642,DANWELL FREY,Danwell Frey is one of Lord Walder Frey’s sons who accompanies Catelyn,1\r\n643,RONEL RIVERS,Ronel Rivers is Walder Frey’s bastard son who accompanies Catelyn,1\r\n416,GREY WIND,\"Grey Wind is the direwolf belonging to Robb Stark, serving as both a loyal companion and a symbol of his power and authority. Known for his fierce and protective nature, Grey Wind reacts aggressively to perceived threats, as demonstrated by his hostility toward Rolph Spicer. The direwolf is often seen accompanying Robb, and at times Bran Stark, on their journeys, reinforcing his role as a constant and formidable presence. Grey Wind’s imposing demeanor and strong bond with Robb Stark make him an emblem of intimidation, reflecting the strength and leadership of his master. As one of the Stark family’s direwolves, Grey Wind embodies the wild and untamed spirit of the North, further solidifying his significance in Robb’s life and legacy.\",6\r\n1541,ROLPH SPICER,\"Rolph Spicer is a knight of notable standing in the Westerlands, closely associated with House Lannister and House Westerling. He was granted the castle of Castamere and elevated to lordship by the Lannisters, a significant honor that underscores his loyalty and service to the powerful family. His ties to the Lannisters are further evidenced by his role as an envoy, having been sent by Robb Stark to deliver Martyn Lannister, likely as part of a diplomatic or strategic arrangement during the War of the Five Kings.\n\nAdditionally, Rolph Spicer is the uncle of Jeyne Westerling, the wife of Robb Stark, which places him in a position of influence within House Westerling. However, his character is viewed with suspicion by Grey Wind, Robb Stark’s direwolf, whose instincts often signal distrust or danger. This detail suggests that despite his familial connections and noble status, Rolph Spicer may harbor questionable motives or allegiances, particularly in the complex political landscape of Westeros.\n\nOverall, Rolph Spicer is a figure of both privilege and intrigue, balancing his loyalty to the Lannisters with his familial duties to House Westerling, all while navigating the tensions of the era. His actions and relationships reflect the broader conflicts and alliances that define the period.\",2\r\n737,FORLEY PRESTER,Commander of the south camp who retreated toward the Golden Tooth,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n171,ROBB,JON,\"Robb Stark and Jon Snow share a significant and poignant moment as they say their farewells before Jon departs. This emotional exchange underscores the deep bond between the two, who, despite not being brothers by blood, share a strong familial connection. Robb, as the eldest Stark son and the acting head of House Stark, holds a position of authority and responsibility, while Jon, though a bastard in the eyes of the world, is treated as family by the Starks.\n\nIn addition to their farewell, Robb reveals his intentions to legitimize Jon, a decision that would grant Jon the Stark name and full rights as a trueborn son. This act of legitimization is a profound gesture, reflecting Robb’s trust and affection for Jon. Furthermore, Robb plans to name Jon as his heir, a move that would secure Jon’s position as the future leader of House Stark. This decision highlights Robb’s recognition of Jon’s character, leadership, and loyalty, despite the societal stigma attached to Jon’s birth.\n\nThe relationship between Robb and Jon is marked by mutual respect and brotherly love, with Robb’s actions demonstrating his willingness to defy convention to honor Jon. Their farewell and Robb’s plans for Jon’s future underscore the complexities of their bond, as well as the challenges they face in a world governed by rigid traditions and expectations. Together, these moments paint a picture of two individuals bound by duty, honor, and an unbreakable familial tie.\",223\r\n1076,HOUSE MANDERLY,ROBB,\"Robb is supported by House Manderly's forces, including Ser Wylis and Ser Wendel\",105\r\n1307,ROBB,WHISPERING WOOD,Robb wins a battle in the Whispering Wood,104\r\n3362,ROBB,RAYNALD,\"Raynald bears Robb's banner, indicating loyalty\",104\r\n1214,ROBB,OLYVAR FREY,Olyvar Frey will become Robb’s squire as part of the agreement,103\r\n1430,ROBB,MAEGE,\"Robb Stark and Maege Mormont are notable figures whose actions suggest a strong alliance and familial bond. Maege Mormont, a seasoned warrior and leader of House Mormont, rode south alongside Robb Stark, the young and determined King in the North. This journey underscores their shared purpose, likely tied to the military and political struggles of the North during a turbulent period. The act of riding south together not only highlights their strategic alliance but also implies deep loyalty and familial ties between the two. Maege’s presence at Robb’s side reinforces the unity among the northern houses, particularly in the face of external threats. Their collaboration reflects a mutual commitment to the defense and sovereignty of the North, solidifying their roles as key figures in the region’s leadership.\",103\r\n716,ROBB,STARK GUARDSMEN,Robb is angry with the guardsmen for their absence during the attack,102\r\n1371,ROBB,UNCLE JAIME,Uncle Jaime was defeated by Robb in battle,102\r\n1764,ROBB,BATTLE OF THE CAMPS,Robb Stark is referencing the Battle of the Camps in his terms,102\r\n1773,ROBB,LORD RICKARD,\"Lord Rickard is a bannerman of Robb, seeking vengeance for his sons\",102\r\n1785,ROBB,THE GREATJON,\"The Greatjon is a powerful ally of Robb, supporting his military campaigns\",102\r\n2615,ROBB,SER STAFFORD,Robb defeated Ser Stafford's host at Oxcross,102\r\n2616,ROBB,LORD RICKARD KARSTARK,Lord Rickard Karstark killed Ser Stafford in the battle at Oxcross,102\r\n2728,ROBB,OXCROSS,Robb reached Oxcross by following a trail,102\r\n2892,ROBB,WESTERLINGS,Robb captured the Crag from the Westerlings,102\r\n3253,ROBB,MARTYN LANNISTER,\"Robb Stark plans to exchange Robett Glover for Martyn Lannister, indicating a negotiation relationship\",102\r\n3337,ROBB,RAYNALD WESTERLING,Raynald Westerling travels with Robb,102\r\n3347,ROBB,SEAGARD,Catelyn will be taken to Seagard under Lord Jason's protection,102\r\n3364,ROBB,JOYEUSE,\"Joyeuse is the wife of Lord Walder Frey, interacting with Robb\",102\r\n3365,ROBB,WATER TOWER,Robb is directed to the Water Tower at the Twins,102\r\n3386,ROBB,SMALLJON,Smalljon tries to save Robb during the Red Wedding,102\r\n1204,LORD WALDER FREY,CATELYN,Lord Walder Frey meets with Catelyn to negotiate the crossing of his territory,101\r\n1456,GALBART GLOVER,ROBB STARK,Galbart Glover is a northern lord supporting Robb Stark,86\r\n2250,KING IN THE NORTH,BRAN STARK,\"Bran Stark represents Robb Stark, the King in the North, at the feast\",62\r\n151,BRAN STARK,FATHER,Bran's father allows him to climb despite his mother's concerns,61\r\n3121,ROBETT GLOVER,GREGOR CLEGANE,Robett Glover is being chased by Gregor Clegane,38\r\n834,RIVERRUN,GOLDEN TOOTH,Forces were gathered near the Golden Tooth in anticipation of defending Riverrun,35\r\n4666,HOSTEEN FREY,WYMAN MANDERLY,\"Hosteen Frey draws his sword and attacks Wyman Manderly, indicating a violent and antagonistic relationship.\",23\r\n2081,RAMSAY SNOW,HOUSE BOLTON,Ramsay Snow is a bastard associated with House Bolton,10\r\n1208,LORD WALDER FREY,JARED FREY,Jared Frey is one of Lord Walder Frey’s sons,9\r\n1210,LORD WALDER FREY,DANWELL FREY,Danwell Frey is one of Lord Walder Frey’s sons,9\r\n1211,LORD WALDER FREY,RONEL RIVERS,Ronel Rivers is Walder Frey’s bastard son,9\r\n3088,GREY WIND,ROLPH SPICER,Grey Wind growls whenever Rolph Spicer is near,8\r\n1399,FORLEY PRESTER,GOLDEN TOOTH,Forley Prester retreated toward the Golden Tooth,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
