Built on fear with mortar mixed with human blood, it is one of the realm's largest and wealthiest domains, featuring five imposing towers, including the Wailing Tower and Kingspyre Tower. Originally the seat of House Whent and previously held by House Lothston, Harrenhal has been a strategic stronghold and a point of contention among various factions.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Harrenhal became a key location for military movements. It was initially held by the Lannisters under Lord Tywin Lannister, who stationed a formidable force of 20,000 men there. Tywin used it as a base to plan his campaigns, including a potential confrontation with Robb Stark. The castle was also where Jaime Lannister recuperated from his injuries, received treatment from Qyburn, and interacted with prisoners, including Brienne of Tarth. The castle's bathhouse and dungeons were sites of significant events, including prisoner escapes and violent incidents.\n\nHarrenhal's control shifted multiple times. It was captured by Roose Bolton, who later awarded it to Vargo Hoat, though Tywin Lannister cursed this decision. Ser Amory Lorch was appointed castellan, and the Bloody Mummers were stationed there before being routed. Gregor Clegane also held the castle at one point, overseeing prisoners taken to serve the Lannisters. Eventually, Harrenhal was granted to Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger), who saw it as a valuable prize, though its cursed reputation persisted.\n\nThe castle is also notable for its historical significance, including the legendary tourney where the Knight of the Laughing Tree appeared. It served as a refuge for some, like Arya Stark, who worked there under Roose Bolton and heard rumors of figures like Beric Dondarrion. Catelyn Stark feared Robb might march on Harrenhal, while Edmure Tully hoped Jaime would be captured there. Despite its strategic importance, Harrenhal's dark legacy and shifting allegiances make it a symbol of both power and peril in the Riverlands.\",32\r\n1008,SHELLA WHENT,\"Lady Shella Whent was a notable figure in the history of Harrenhal, a castle with a long and cursed legacy. As a former ruler of Harrenhal, she held the seat before Lord Tywin Lannister took control. Her tenure as the lady of Harrenhal was marked by her association with the castle’s dark reputation, though details of her rule remain sparse.\n\nShella Whent was known to be a friend of the Night’s Watch, suggesting she maintained alliances or sympathies with the order. However, her time at Harrenhal came to an end when she fled the castle, leaving behind only a small staff. The circumstances of her departure are unclear, but it contributed to the castle’s turbulent history. By the time of her death, she had already relinquished control of Harrenhal, leaving behind a legacy intertwined with its infamous past.\n\nThough her exact fate is not detailed, her connection to Harrenhal and her eventual flight from it underscore the castle’s reputation as a place of misfortune for its rulers. Lady Shella Whent remains a figure of historical significance in the broader narrative of Westeros, particularly in relation to Harrenhal’s cursed lineage.\",2\r\n484,AEGON THE CONQUEROR,\"Aegon the Conqueror is a pivotal historical figure in the lore of Westeros, renowned for his conquests and the unification of the Seven Kingdoms. An ancestor of later rulers bearing his name, Aegon is famously referenced by figures such as Tyrion Lannister for his strategic use of dragon fire in battle, a tactic that played a crucial role in his military campaigns. His most notable conquest includes the capture of Harrenhal, where he employed his dragons to devastating effect, reducing the formidable fortress to ruins and solidifying his dominance.\n\nAegon’s legacy is defined by his ambition and vision, as he successfully united the fractured realms of Westeros under a single rule, establishing the foundation for the Targaryen dynasty. His reign marked the beginning of a new era, characterized by centralized power and the creation of the Iron Throne, a symbol of his authority and the seat of the ruling monarch. The Iron Throne, forged from the swords of his defeated enemies, stands as a testament to his conquest and the consolidation of his power. Aegon the Conqueror remains a towering figure in history, remembered for his military prowess, his dragons, and his role in shaping the political landscape of Westeros.\",3\r\n1364,SER AMORY LORCH,\"Ser Amory Lorch is a knight who served as the castellan of Harrenhal, a formidable and historically significant fortress in the Riverlands. His tenure as castellan placed him in a position of authority, overseeing the defense and administration of the castle. Despite his role, Ser Amory Lorch is notably remembered for the controversy surrounding his alleged involvement in the deaths of Rhaegar Targaryen's children. While he was falsely accused of this heinous act, the accusation contributed to his infamous reputation.

He is also responsible for the death of Ser Amory Lorch, whom he kills using a bear, showcasing his brutal methods. Additionally, Hoat holds Brienne of Tarth captive and interacts with Jaime Lannister, refusing to release them for ransom despite their noble status.\n\nRumors surround Hoat, including claims that he killed Beric Dondarrion, though his most confirmed atrocities involve his treatment of Jaime and his role in the violent affairs of Harrenhal.
