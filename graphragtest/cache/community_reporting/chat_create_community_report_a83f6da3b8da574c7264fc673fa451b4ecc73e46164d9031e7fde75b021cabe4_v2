The Kingsmoot is called to determine the next ruler of the Iron Islands, ensuring leadership is chosen through collective decision-making rather than hereditary succession alone.\n\nAeron Greyjoy, a prominent figure among the Ironborn, plays a key role in summoning the Kingsmoot, emphasizing its importance in their society. The event is marked by the participation of influential captains and warriors, each vying for support or casting their votes for the most worthy candidate. The Kingsmoot is not merely a political gathering but a reflection of the Ironborn's values, where strength, cunning, and leadership are paramount.\n\nOne notable instance of the Kingsmoot occurred after the Ironborn's campaign at Moat Cailin, where Victarion Greyjoy, a formidable ironborn commander, departed to attend the gathering.

The children of the forest are known for their deep connection to nature and magic, playing a significant role in the history of Westeros.\n\nSecondly, Ash is also the name of Balon Greyjoy's daughter, whom he intended to succeed him as ruler of the Iron Islands. However, her succession is opposed by her uncle, Aeron Greyjoy, due to her gender, reflecting the Ironborn's traditional and patriarchal views on leadership. This conflict highlights the cultural and political tensions within House Greyjoy and the broader society of the Iron Islands.\n\nDespite sharing the same name, these two characters are unrelated and exist in separate narrative contexts—one tied to mythical beings and the other to the political struggles of a noble house.\",1\r\n1825,NAGGA'S HILL,\"Nagga's Hill is an ancient and sacred location on Old Wyk, one of the Iron Islands, steeped in legend and history.
