He is a hedge knight who consorts with Cersei, assisting her in raising sellswords and executing her schemes. Cersei appoints him to command the Kingsguard in Jaime Lannister’s absence, though his reputation within the order is questionable. As a member of the Kingsguard, Osmund is deeply involved in Cersei’s political maneuvering, often delivering news to her and acting on her behalf.\n\nOsmund plays a key role in Cersei’s more sinister plans, including the killing of gaolers on her orders. Alongside Boros Blount, he carries out these acts, though they are later reprimanded by Jaime Lannister for their actions. Despite his controversial methods, Osmund remains a loyal servant to Cersei, standing by her side even as the Tower of the Hand burns. His involvement in Cersei’s affairs extends to informing her about the movements of guards and secret passages, further cementing his role as a trusted, if morally ambiguous, agent of her will. His actions reflect both his allegiance to Cersei and the questionable nature of his service within the Kingsguard.\",6\r\n546,BOROS BLOUNT,\"Ser Boros Blount is a knight and former member of the Kingsguard, a prestigious order sworn to protect the royal family. His tenure in the Kingsguard was marked by controversy and failure, as he was ultimately stripped of his position for failing to defend King Tommen Baratheon, an act that drew criticism for perceived cowardice. Despite his shortcomings, Blount remained a loyal servant to Queen Cersei Lannister, carrying out her orders on multiple occasions.\n\nBlount was involved in several notable incidents, including delivering a summons to Tyrion Lannister and escorting Sansa Stark to the small council. However, his most infamous actions involved the mistreatment of Sansa Stark, whom he struck at the command of King Joffrey Baratheon, demonstrating his willingness to follow cruel orders. Additionally, he was tasked by Cersei to check on Tyrion’s cell, further illustrating his role as an enforcer of her will.\n\nHis loyalty to Cersei extended to violent acts, as he, alongside Osmund Kettleblack, killed two gaolers on her orders, though he was later reprimanded by Ser Jaime Lannister for this action. Blount also played a role in delivering news to Cersei, reinforcing his position as a trusted, if morally questionable, agent of the crown.\n\nBeyond his duties, Blount was known for his peculiar claim of never having seen Ser Robert Strong use the privy, adding an odd footnote to his character. Despite his tarnished reputation, he was considered as a potential champion for Margaery Tyrell, though this role never materialized. Ser Boros Blount’s legacy is one of flawed loyalty, marked by both obedience to authority and a willingness to engage in brutality when commanded.\",11\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3529,OSMUND KETTLEBLACK,JAIME,Jaime questions Osmund Kettleblack's reputation,98\r\n1576,BOROS BLOUNT,KINGSGUARD,Ser Boros Blount is a member of the Kingsguard.,44\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
