Originally an exiled knight from Westeros, he fled justice and initially served as an informant for King Robert before ultimately joining Daenerys Targaryen’s service. As an advisor and protector to Daenerys, he plays a crucial role in her journey, offering counsel and sharing his past experiences to guide her. His loyalty to her is unwavering, though his methods are sometimes questionable, such as when he captures Tyrion Lannister in an attempt to regain her favor.\n\nJorah is depicted as a knight who accompanies Daenerys and serves as her advisor, often warning her against trusting others, including Daario Naharis. His devotion to her is so profound that he appears in her hallucinations, symbolizing his deep impact on her life. Despite his exile and past transgressions, he remains a figure of influence, even inspiring Jon Snow to leave behind his sword in a moment of reflection.\n\nAt times, Jorah’s actions are driven by his love for Daenerys, leading him to make advances toward her, though his intentions are not always reciprocated. His past includes being sold into slavery, yet he manages to rise above his circumstances, demonstrating resilience. He is also a figure who agrees with Tyrion Lannister about the losing side of a battle, showcasing his strategic mind.\n\nIn addition to his role as an advisor, Jorah is known for his protective nature, even assisting Tyrion and Penny in obtaining water and later joining the mercenary group, the Second Sons.
