In this process, the outcome of a legal case is decided by a fight, typically between the accused and an accuser or their respective champions. The belief underlying this practice is that divine intervention or the inherent justice of the cause would ensure the victory of the righteous party. Historically, trial by combat was used in various legal systems, particularly in medieval Europe, as a means of settling disputes when other forms of evidence were lacking or inconclusive. The accused's innocence or guilt was often determined by the result of the combat, with the victor being deemed justified by a higher power or the law. This method was eventually phased out as legal systems evolved to rely more on evidence and due process rather than physical confrontation.\",2\r\n65,SANSA STARK,\"Sansa Stark is the eldest daughter of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Stark, making her a noblewoman from the North and a key figure in the political struggles of her family. Initially betrothed to Crown Prince Joffrey Baratheon, she is an eleven-year-old girl who attends a tourney in King’s Landing, where she interacts with Joffrey and her younger sister, Arya Stark. Her desires and fears are evident in her interactions, particularly her infatuation with Joffrey, which leads her to betray her father’s plans out of love for him.\n\nAfter her father’s execution, Sansa becomes a hostage of the Lannisters, held captive in King’s Landing as a political pawn. She is mentioned in the peace terms between her brother Robb Stark and the Lannisters, and her disappearance is later noted in relation to a girl found with Lord Tywin. During her captivity, she is fitted for gowns by Queen Cersei and remains a prominent figure in the royal court, often seeking mercy for her father’s memory.\n\nSansa loses her direwolf, Lady, and is later betrothed to Tyrion Lannister, though this marriage is never consummated. She eventually disappears from King’s Landing, fleeing the Lannisters’ control. Later, she is mentioned as the wife of Tyrion Lannister, though she prays in the godswood, reflecting her enduring faith and resilience. Throughout her ordeals, she remains a central character in the story, embodying both the vulnerabilities and strengths of her noble lineage.\",29\r\n66,JOFFREY BARATHEON,\"Joffrey Baratheon is a controversial and polarizing figure in the Seven Kingdoms, known for his cruelty, impulsiveness, and volatile nature. Officially recognized as the son of King Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister, his legitimacy is widely questioned, with claims—most notably by Stannis Baratheon—that he is actually the product of incest between Cersei and her brother Jaime Lannister. Despite these doubts, Joffrey ascends to the throne following Robert Baratheon's death, becoming the King of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nAs king, Joffrey rules with a harsh and unpredictable hand, earning a reputation for brutality. His actions include the execution of Ned Stark, Sansa Stark’s father, and the mistreatment of Sansa herself, whom he torments while boasting of his power. His authority is frequently contested, both due to his questionable lineage and his tyrannical behavior, which alienates many within the realm. Figures like Tyrion Lannister even threaten to expose secrets that could further undermine his rule, such as the actions of his cousin Lancel Lannister.\n\nInitially serving as Crown Prince before his coronation, Joffrey’s reign is marked by instability and fear. His youth—being only twelve years old at the time of his ascension—does little to temper his cruelty, and his decisions often reflect his immaturity and sadistic tendencies. Despite his contested claim to the throne, he wields power in name, with loyalists like Ser Amory Lorch acting in his authority. His rule remains a dark and tumultuous period in the history of the Seven Kingdoms, defined by his ruthlessness and the shadow of illegitimacy that looms over his reign.\",18\r\n627,LADY MOTHER,,1\r\n291,MARGAERY TYRELL,\"Margaery Tyrell is a prominent noblewoman from House Tyrell, the daughter of Mace Tyrell, and a key figure in the political landscape of Westeros. Initially, she was betrothed to King Robert Baratheon as his potential new queen, though this arrangement did not come to fruition. Instead, she became the wife of Renly Baratheon, Robert’s younger brother, and was known as his young queen, being of a similar age to Robb Stark. Her beauty was notable, as Renly once showed her picture to Ned Stark.\n\nFollowing Renly’s death, Margaery’s political significance persisted. She was first betrothed to Joffrey Baratheon, though this engagement was later dissolved. Subsequently, she became the betrothed and later the wife of King Tommen Baratheon, solidifying her role as Queen Consort. Her marriage to Tommen placed her at the center of court politics, where she emerged as a formidable rival to Cersei Lannister.\n\nMargaery’s life was marked by political intrigue and conflict. She faced accusations of fornication and was imprisoned, mirroring Cersei’s own legal troubles. In response, she demanded a trial by combat to prove her innocence, reflecting her resilience and determination. Her brother, Loras Tyrell, was known to be deeply protective of her, even traveling to Bitterbridge to see her during turbulent times.\n\nAdditionally, Margaery’s reputation and virtue were subjects of scrutiny, particularly concerning Joffrey Baratheon’s concerns about her maidenhead. Despite these challenges, she remained a central figure in the power struggles of the realm, leveraging her intelligence, charm, and political acumen to navigate the treacherous waters of the royal court. Her story is one of ambition, survival, and the relentless pursuit of power in a world where nobility and cunning are essential for survival.\",14\r\n810,TOMEN BARATHEON,\"Tommen Baratheon is the younger brother of Joffrey Baratheon and the young king of the Seven Kingdoms. Following the death of his brother, Tommen ascends to the throne, though his reign is heavily influenced by external forces, particularly Margaery Tyrell, who seeks to guide and manipulate his rule. Despite his youth and inexperience, Tommen is depicted as eager and enthusiastic, particularly about events such as the tourney, where he shows excitement and a desire to participate. His character is marked by a combination of innocence and vulnerability, making him susceptible to the political maneuvering of those around him. As king, Tommen's authority is often overshadowed by the ambitions of others, yet he remains a central figure in the governance of the realm.\",4\r\n2114,SER GARLAN THE GALLANT,Ser Garlan the Gallant is Margaery's brother and a potential champion for her in a trial by combat,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4160,CERSEI,TRIAL BY COMBAT,Trial by combat is the judicial process Cersei seeks to use to prove her innocence,135\r\n87,SANSA STARK,JOFFREY BARATHEON,\"Sansa Stark and Joffrey Baratheon were central figures in a political alliance between Houses Stark and Baratheon. Initially, Sansa held affection for Joffrey, viewing him as a charming prince before the tragic execution of her father, Ned Stark, which shattered her idealized perception of him. Despite this, a marriage between the two was proposed to solidify the union of their powerful houses, symbolizing a strategic alliance in the turbulent political landscape of Westeros.\n\nJoffrey Baratheon, as the heir to the Iron Throne, was betrothed to Sansa Stark, and their engagement was publicly acknowledged during key events, such as the tourney and a feast where Joffrey escorted her. These interactions were part of the broader political maneuvering to secure loyalty and stability between the North and the crown. However, the relationship was fraught with tension, as Joffrey’s cruel and unpredictable nature became increasingly apparent, particularly after his role in Ned Stark’s death.\n\nThe proposed marriage between Sansa and Joffrey represented both a personal and political turning point. For Sansa, it marked a transition from innocence to harsh reality, while for Joffrey, it was a means to assert his authority and control over the Stark family. Despite the initial romantic notions, the alliance ultimately became a source of conflict, reflecting the broader struggles for power in the realm. Their interactions, though initially formal and ceremonial, underscored the underlying instability of their relationship and the fragile nature of their betrothal.\",47\r\n1161,SANSA STARK,LADY MOTHER,Sansa Stark draws strength from her lady mother,30\r\n597,MARGAERY TYRELL,KING ROBERT,Margaery Tyrell is planned to be King Robert's new queen,24\r\n1568,JOFFREY BARATHEON,DONTOS HOLLARD,Joffrey Baratheon spares Dontos Hollard from execution and makes him his fool.,24\r\n3958,TOMEN BARATHEON,MARGAERY TYRELL,\"Tommen Baratheon is under the influence of Margaery Tyrell, who encourages his actions\",18\r\n4163,MARGAERY TYRELL,SER GARLAN THE GALLANT,Ser Garlan the Gallant is Margaery's brother and her desired champion in a trial by combat,15\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
