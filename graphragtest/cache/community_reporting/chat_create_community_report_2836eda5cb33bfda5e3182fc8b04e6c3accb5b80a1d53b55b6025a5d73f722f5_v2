A cunning and politically astute nobleman, he is known for his intricate maneuvering and strategic alliances, often waiting until the outcome of conflicts is clear before committing his forces. As a father to numerous children, including Stevron Frey and Elmar Frey, and grandfather to the Walders, he has used his family as tools in his political schemes, including offering his daughters as potential brides to secure alliances, such as with Ser Brynden.\n\nWalder Frey’s reputation is marred by distrust due to his past disloyalty, most notably his broken alliance with Robb Stark. This betrayal stemmed from Robb’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which nullified a prior agreement to wed one of Frey’s daughters. His late arrival at the Battle of the Trident further cemented his reputation for opportunism. Despite this, he remained a key player in the political landscape, negotiating with both Robb Stark and Catelyn Stark for the passage of Robb’s army across the Green Fork, amassing 4,000 men in the process.\n\nFrey’s most infamous act was orchestrating the Red Wedding, a massacre that resulted in the deaths of Robb Stark and many of his bannermen, solidifying his role in the downfall of House Stark. His involvement in political intrigue extended to the death of a king, further demonstrating his ruthless ambition. Additionally, he was considered a potential recipient of Harrenhal, highlighting his influence and the rewards he sought for his actions.\n\nAs the Lord of the Twins, Walder Frey’s legacy is one of calculated betrayal and political pragmatism, making him one of the most feared and distrusted figures in the realm.

He is described as tall and stout, often engaging in games with the other children at Winterfell.\n\nDuring his time at Winterfell, Little Walder is bitten by Shaggydog, one of the Stark direwolves, and is present at feasts, where he interacts with Rickon Stark. He is also one of the Frey boys who later interacts with Reek (Theon Greyjoy) at the Dreadfort. Additionally, Little Walder is involved in discussions about the line of succession within House Frey following the death of Stevron Frey, indicating his awareness of political matters within his family.\n\nLittle Walder’s life comes to a violent end when he is killed, an event that sparks a significant conflict between House Frey and House Manderly. His death serves as a catalyst for the broader tensions and eventual fight in Winterfell, highlighting the deep-seated animosities between the houses.

Black Walder is also the brother of Edwyn Frey, though their relationship is marked by tension, as he is perceived as a potential threat to Edwyn’s position and influence.\n\nDuring the infamous Red Wedding, Black Walder played an active role in the massacre, where he hampered one of the Vances, contributing to the brutal betrayal of House Stark and their allies. His actions during this event underscore his loyalty to House Frey and their alliance with House Bolton and the Lannisters. Additionally, he was part of the welcoming party that greeted the Starks and their bannermen under the guise of hospitality, only to later turn on them in a calculated act of treachery.\n\nFollowing Robb Stark’s perceived betrayal of the Freys by breaking his marriage pact, Black Walder led a contingent of men back to the Twins, further solidifying his role as a key enforcer of his family’s interests. His leadership and participation in these critical moments demonstrate his commitment to House Frey’s ambitions and his willingness to take decisive action in their name.\n\nOverall, Black Walder Frey is a formidable and cunning figure within his house, known for his ruthlessness and strategic involvement in pivotal events that shaped the political landscape of Westeros.

As the eldest son of Walder Frey, he played a key role in the political and military affairs of the house, serving as a bannerman and representing his family in important negotiations. Notably, he led the initial discussions with Robb Stark, demonstrating his leadership and diplomatic responsibilities within the family.\n\nStevron Frey was also the half-brother of Merrett Frey, further solidifying his position within the complex familial structure of House Frey. His lineage extended to include a grandson, Petyr Pimple, who was later captured, adding to the family's turbulent history.\n\nDespite his significant role, Stevron Frey's life came to an end, as he is described as a deceased individual in the text. His death prompted discussions about the succession of House Frey, as he had been the designated heir. His passing marked a turning point for the family, leading to uncertainty and debate over who would inherit his position and responsibilities.

The location is also where Robb Stark and his forces cross, reinforcing its military significance. Additionally, The Twins is a destination for Catelyn and Robb as they travel, and it becomes the site of a fateful wedding where Robb Stark and many of his bannermen are betrayed and killed in a massacre orchestrated by the Freys, an event known as the Red Wedding.\n\nThe Twins is deeply associated with House Frey’s power and influence, serving as the residence of Lord Walder Frey and his family. It is where Emmon Frey’s marriage to Genna Lannister is referenced, and where Lord Walder’s daughters are to be met. The location is also a place of captivity, holding hostages such as Marq Piper and other prisoners, including those taken by the Freys after Robb Stark’s betrayal.\n\nThe Hound, Sandor Clegane, plans to ransom Arya Stark to Robb at The Twins but ultimately prevents her from entering, recognizing the danger posed by the Freys. The Twins is also near where the war has spread, and its control by House Frey blocks retreat for opposing forces, making it a critical stronghold.\n\nThe Walders, prominent members of House Frey, hail from The Twins, further emphasizing its importance in the story. The location is frequently mentioned as a gathering place for Frey men, as noted by Ramsay Bolton, and serves as a base for Lord Walder Frey’s forces. After Robb Stark’s death, figures like Ryman Frey and Black Walder return to The Twins, solidifying its role as the heart of House Frey’s power.\n\nIn summary, The Twins is a pivotal location—both militarily and politically—where key events unfold, alliances are forged and broken, and where the Freys exert their dominance over the region. Its dual-castle structure and control over the Green Fork make it indispensable in the broader conflict.\",11\r\n1339,EDWYN FREY,\"Edwyn Frey is a prominent member of House Frey, known for his aggressive behavior and significant role within the family.

During the wedding feast of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, Ryman was seated next to Catelyn Stark, indicating his high status within the family.\n\nFollowing Robb Stark's perceived betrayal of House Frey by breaking his marriage pact, Ryman Frey played an active role in the family's response. He led a contingent of Frey men back to the Twins, reinforcing the family's stronghold and preparing for further conflict. Additionally, he was tasked with leading a group to greet Robb Stark, though the nature of this encounter remains ambiguous.\n\nRyman Frey eventually succeeded as the Lord of the Crossing, ruling from the Twins, though his tenure was short-lived. He met a grim fate at the hands of Lady Stoneheart, the resurrected Catelyn Stark, who hanged him in retribution for the Red Wedding and the betrayal of House Stark. His death marked a significant moment in the ongoing feud between the Freys and the Starks, further destabilizing the already fractured political landscape of the Riverlands.\n\nThroughout his life, Ryman Frey was a loyal servant of House Frey, embodying the family's ruthless and pragmatic approach to power.

Additionally, Ramsay Bolton's men were also seeking out the Freys, indicating that House Frey's actions or whereabouts were of considerable importance to Bolton's forces. The reasons behind these searches remain unclear, but they underscore the Freys' significance in the broader political landscape.\n\nHouse Frey's involvement in these events highlights their central role in the intricate web of noble intrigue, where loyalty and betrayal often go hand in hand. Their ability to navigate such treacherous waters has cemented their status as a family to be both respected and feared.

In a notable incident, Shaggydog attacked Little Walder Frey after the latter struck Rickon Stark, demonstrating the direwolf's fierce loyalty and defensive instincts. The confrontation resulted in Little Walder being bitten, an act that underscored Shaggydog's role as a guardian of the Stark family. Following the attack, Shaggydog was confined, likely as a consequence of the violent encounter.
