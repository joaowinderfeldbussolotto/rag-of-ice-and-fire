The region is home to notable locations like Sunspear, the seat of House Martell, and Shandystone, as well as the Tower of Joy, where Willam Dustin died.\n\nHistorically, Dorne has been at odds with neighboring regions, particularly the Reach, and has maintained a reputation for political autonomy. The kingdom is also renowned for its rich wine vintage and unique traditions. Dorne played a significant role in the political landscape of Westeros, including during the reign of Aerys II Targaryen, who sought to secure its loyalty by holding Elia Martell hostage.\n\nIn the broader narrative, Dorne is a key player in various political and military strategies. Tyrion Lannister suggests Dorne as a potential landing point for Aegon Targaryen, seeking its support for a rebellion. The region is also considered a possible ally for a Targaryen invasion due to its historical ties with the Targaryens through a secret pact. Prince Doran Martell, the ruler of Dorne, is a figure of influence, with Tyrion attempting to persuade him to avoid aligning with other factions.\n\nDorne is central to several plotlines, including the protection and political maneuvering around Myrcella Baratheon, who is sent there for safety. The region is also tied to the fate of Quentyn Martell, whose body is to be returned for burial, and whose companions are advised to return. Additionally, Dorne is involved in the aftermath of Robert Baratheon’s death, with news of the event reaching the kingdom.\n\nDespite its complex political landscape, Dorne remains a powerful and independent force in Westeros, with its loyalty and alliances being crucial to the broader conflicts in the realm.
