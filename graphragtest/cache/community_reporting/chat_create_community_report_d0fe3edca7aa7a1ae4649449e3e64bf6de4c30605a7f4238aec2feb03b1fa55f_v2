One of the most prominent is Brandon Stark, the eldest son of Rickard Stark and elder brother of Eddard Stark. Known for his wild and passionate nature, he was betrothed to Catelyn Tully but was also enamored with Lady Barbrey Dustin. His life was marked by a duel with Petyr Baelish, whom he spared after defeating him. Tragically, he was executed by the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen, a pivotal event that contributed to Robert’s Rebellion. His bones were later returned to Winterfell, and a statue in his honor stands in the crypts beneath the castle.\n\nAnother Brandon Stark is referenced as a historical figure who pursued Bael the Bard, a legendary figure in the North’s folklore. Additionally, the name is tied to a Stark ancestor who ventured south and never returned, as well as a missing person mentioned by Craster. Theon Greyjoy also dreams of a deceased Stark named Brandon, adding to the mystique surrounding the name.\n\nThe name Brandon Stark also belongs to Bran Stark’s brother, though this may refer to a different individual or a familial naming tradition. The recurring use of the name across generations underscores its importance in the legacy of House Stark, symbolizing both honor and tragedy. Whether as a historical lord, a fallen hero, or a figure of legend, Brandon Stark remains a significant and multifaceted figure in the annals of the North.\",11\r\n1393,RICKARD,\"Lord Rickard Stark is a prominent figure in the history of Westeros, known for his role as the head of House Stark and the father of Brandon Stark. He is also the grandfather of Jon Snow, connecting him to key characters in the broader narrative. Rickard is remembered for his tragic fate, as he was burned alive by King Aerys II Targaryen, an event that marked a turning point in the lead-up to Robert's Rebellion. Additionally, he is recognized by Qhorin Halfhand, suggesting his influence and reputation extended beyond his immediate family. Rickard Stark's legacy is one of honor and tragedy, shaping the political and personal dynamics of his descendants and the realm at large. His death at the hands of the Mad King underscored the brutality of Aerys' rule and fueled the rebellion that ultimately overthrew the Targaryen dynasty.\",3\r\n19,CATELYN TULLY,\"Catelyn Tully, originally betrothed to Brandon Stark, later became the wife of Eddard Stark and the mother of their children, including Robb and Bran Stark. As a prominent figure in House Stark, she played a significant role in the political and familial dynamics of the North. Catelyn was deeply involved in the events of the War of the Five Kings, driven by her loyalty to her family and her desire to protect her children. Tragically, she met her end at the Red Wedding, a brutal massacre orchestrated by House Frey and House Bolton, where she was murdered alongside her son Robb Stark and his forces. Her death marked a devastating turning point in the conflict and left a lasting impact on the Stark family and the broader struggle for power in Westeros.\",4\r\n574,RICKARD STARK,\"Rickard Stark was a prominent historical figure and the former Lord of Winterfell, serving as the head of House Stark before his death. He was the father of Brandon Stark and Eddard Stark, and he played a significant role in the political landscape of the North. Known for his strategic maneuvering, Rickard arranged the betrothals of his sons to further his political ambitions, solidifying alliances and strengthening his family's position.\n\nAs the liege lord of Roose Bolton, Rickard held considerable influence in the North, and his authority was respected by his bannermen. His leadership was marked by both strength and cunning, though his reign was cut short by his tragic demise. Rickard Stark was executed by Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King, who subjected him to brutal torture before burning him alive—a fate that left a lasting impact on those who knew him, including his son Eddard and even Theon Greyjoy, who later dreamed of him.\n\nRickard’s death was a pivotal moment in the history of Westeros, as it contributed to the growing tensions between House Stark and the Targaryen dynasty. His legacy endured through his sons, particularly Eddard Stark, who inherited his father’s sense of duty and leadership. Though Rickard’s life was marked by political intrigue and ultimately a violent end, his influence on the North and his family’s future remained profound. His memory is preserved in historical accounts and the recollections of those who knew him, ensuring that his role in the history of Westeros is not forgotten.\",4\r\n2313,BARBREY DUSTIN,\"Barbrey Dustin, also known as Lady Barbrey, is a prominent northern noblewoman with a deep connection to House Stark and a complex history intertwined with the political landscape of the North. As the Lady of Barrowton, she holds significant influence and plays a key role in the region’s affairs. Barbrey is known for her efforts to calm tensions between the lords of Winterfell, demonstrating her diplomatic skills and commitment to maintaining stability in the North.\n\nHer relationship with House Stark is marked by both loyalty and personal history, reflecting her nuanced position within the northern hierarchy. Barbrey’s interactions extend beyond the Starks, as she engages with other major figures, including Theon Greyjoy and Roose Bolton. However, her distrust of the Boltons is well-documented, suggesting a cautious and perhaps adversarial stance toward them, despite any necessary political dealings.\n\nBarbrey Dustin’s character is defined by her strong ties to the North’s traditions and her strategic role in its governance. Her actions and alliances highlight her as a significant figure in the broader narrative of the region, balancing her loyalty to the Starks with the pragmatic realities of northern politics.\",4\r\n2359,THE MAD KING,The Mad King is responsible for the deaths of Rickard and Brandon Stark,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n781,BRANDON STARK,CATELYN,Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark before his death,104\r\n2897,RICKARD,AERYS,Aerys burned Rickard Stark alive,27\r\n36,CATELYN TULLY,HOUSE TULLY,Catelyn Tully is a member of House Tully,18\r\n1035,RICKARD STARK,BRANDON STARK,Brandon Stark is the son of Rickard Stark,15\r\n4547,BARBREY DUSTIN,BRANDON STARK,\"Barbrey Dustin had a romantic relationship with Brandon Stark, who was enamored with her before his betrothal to Catelyn Tully\",15\r\n4550,BRANDON STARK,THE MAD KING,The Mad King murdered Brandon Stark,13\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
