This event marked a pivotal moment in the fall of House Targaryen.\n\nHowever, Aegon is also referenced in other capacities. In Daenerys Targaryen’s visions, he appears as a historical figure symbolizing the \"\"Prince that was Promised,\"\" one of the three heads of the dragon, and a conqueror who used dragons to subdue the Seven Kingdoms, including the destruction of Harrenhal. This suggests a legendary status tied to prophecy and Targaryen legacy.\n\nAdditionally, there are conflicting accounts regarding his fate. While history records his death as a child, some narratives suggest that Aegon may have survived and was later groomed to reclaim the throne, seeking alliances to restore his birthright. This version of Aegon is depicted as a young prince, advised by Tyrion Lannister, and presented as a potential heir to the Targaryen legacy.\n\nFurthermore, Aegon is mentioned as the brother of Maester Aemon, who ruled after their father, indicating another historical or familial connection within the Targaryen line.
