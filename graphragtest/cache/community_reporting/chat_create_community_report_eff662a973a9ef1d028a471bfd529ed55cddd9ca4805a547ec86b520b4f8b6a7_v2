Originally forged from the reworked metal of Ice, the ancestral greatsword of House Stark, Oathkeeper was given to Brienne by Jaime Lannister as a token of trust and respect. The sword holds significant symbolic value, representing Brienne’s oath to protect the innocent and uphold justice.\n\nOathkeeper plays a crucial role in Brienne’s journey, serving as her primary weapon in several key encounters. Notably, she wields it to defeat the outlaws Pyg and Timeon, demonstrating her skill and commitment to her mission. However, the sword also becomes a point of contention when it is presented to Lady Stoneheart (the resurrected Catelyn Stark) as evidence against Brienne, further complicating her path.\n\nThroughout its appearances, Oathkeeper remains intrinsically linked to Brienne’s character, embodying her honor, loyalty, and unwavering dedication to her vows. Its Valyrian steel composition and storied origins make it one of the most notable weapons in the series, reinforcing Brienne’s status as a formidable warrior and a figure of moral integrity.\",3\r\n1143,HOUSE TARTH,\"House Tarth is a noble house from the fictional universe of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. Known for its chivalrous traditions, the house is represented by a knight who participates in tourney melees, showcasing their martial prowess and adherence to knightly virtues. Politically, House Tarth is a staunch ally of Renly Baratheon, one of the claimants to the Iron Throne during the War of the Five Kings. Alongside other noble houses, House Tarth actively supports Renly’s cause, demonstrating their loyalty and strategic alignment in the conflict. Their involvement in both martial and political affairs underscores their significance within the realm, blending honor with ambition in the turbulent landscape of Westeros.\",4\r\n1132,BRIENNE OF TARTH,\"Brienne of Tarth is a formidable knight and a prominent figure in the realm, known for her unwavering loyalty, exceptional martial skills, and dedication to her vows. As the daughter of Selwyn the Evenstar, she inherits a legacy of honor and combat prowess, having been the champion of a tourney melee. Brienne serves as a member of Renly Baratheon’s Rainbow Guard, a prestigious group of knights sworn to protect him. In this role, she prepares Renly for battle and carries his banner, demonstrating her deep commitment to his cause. However, her association with Renly takes a dark turn when she is falsely accused of his murder, a charge that tarnishes her reputation despite her innocence.\n\nHer path later intersects with that of Jaime Lannister, whom she encounters and eventually demands assistance from in her quest to find and protect Sansa Stark. This mission underscores her sense of duty and her determination to uphold justice, even in the face of adversity. Brienne’s journey is marked by her resilience and her refusal to conform to traditional expectations of women, as she carves out a place for herself in a world dominated by male warriors. Her story is one of honor, perseverance, and an unyielding commitment to her principles, making her one of the most respected and admired knights in the realm.\",9\r\n1148,A TOURNEY MELEE,A tournament event taking place beneath the battlements of a small castle,2\r\n1147,SELWYN THE EVENSTAR,Lord of House Tarth and father of Brienne,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3564,JAIME,OATHKEEPER,Jaime gives Brienne the Valyrian sword Oathkeeper,95\r\n2288,HOUSE TARTH,BRIENNE OF TARTH,\"Brienne of Tarth is a member of House Tarth\nBrienne is a member of House Tarth\",13\r\n2290,SER LORAS TYRELL,A TOURNEY MELEE,Ser Loras Tyrell participates in the tourney melee,11\r\n2291,BRIENNE OF TARTH,SELWYN THE EVENSTAR,Brienne is the daughter of Selwyn the Evenstar,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
