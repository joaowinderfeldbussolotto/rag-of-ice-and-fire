It is most notably recognized as the vessel aboard which Theon Greyjoy journeys to Pyke. The ship serves as a crucial means of transportation in the region, connecting significant points of interest and playing a part in the movements of notable figures such as Theon Greyjoy. While specific details about its size, crew, or construction are not provided, its mention in navigation records and association with Theon Greyjoy’s travels highlight its importance in maritime activities within the described setting.\",2\r\n16,THEON GREYJOY,\"Theon Greyjoy is a complex and multifaceted character from the Iron Islands, known for his tumultuous relationships and shifting allegiances. As the son of Balon Greyjoy and a prince of the Iron Islands, he was sent as a ward to House Stark, where he was raised alongside Robb, Bran, and the other Stark children. Initially, he was a companion and friend to Robb Stark, participating in battles, offering strategic advice, and even visiting Catelyn Stark after an attack. His bold behavior and interactions with serving wenches marked his early days in Winterfell, where he was recognized as \"\"Stark's ward.\"\"\n\nHowever, Theon's identity and loyalties became conflicted. After returning to the Iron Islands following a decade-long absence, he was met with coldness by his father, Balon, who viewed him as weak and unworthy of succession. Struggling with his sense of self and leadership, Theon sought to prove himself by seizing Winterfell, betraying the Starks in the process. He falsely claimed responsibility for the deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, though they had actually escaped, and declared himself the Lord of the Iron Islands. His actions led to his downfall, as he was eventually captured and tortured by Ramsay Bolton, who reduced him to a broken man known as \"\"Reek.\"\"\n\nDespite his earlier bravado—such as boasting about nearly crossing swords with Jaime Lannister and calling for Jaime's execution—Theon's later life was marked by suffering and degradation. He was forced to serve the Boltons, stripped of his identity, and brought before figures like Barbrey Dustin in a state of utter submission. His story is one of tragedy, as he was once a proud prince and military leader but ultimately became a victim of his own ambitions and the cruelty of others. His legacy remains a cautionary tale of betrayal, identity, and the consequences of power.\",62\r\n25,HOUSE GREYJOY,\"House Greyjoy is a noble family originating from the Iron Islands, a region known for its harsh terrain and seafaring culture. As the ruling house of Pyke, they hold significant power and influence over the Ironborn, the fierce and independent people of the Iron Islands. Led by Balon Greyjoy, the family is deeply entrenched in the political and military affairs of Westeros.\n\nHouse Greyjoy is also speculated to support Viserys Targaryen’s claim to the Iron Throne, though their allegiance remains a subject of intrigue and debate. Their potential backing of Viserys could stem from a desire to challenge the ruling powers of Westeros or to secure greater autonomy for the Iron Islands. Regardless, their involvement in such matters underscores their ambition and willingness to engage in the broader conflicts of the realm.\n\nWith a reputation for naval prowess and a fierce adherence to the old ways of the Ironborn, House Greyjoy stands as a formidable force in Westeros, balancing regional dominance with strategic political maneuvering.\",3\r\n1201,STONY SHORE,\"**Stony Shore** is a coastal region of significant strategic and narrative importance.

Following the battle, Dagmer Cleftjaw is seen leading survivors through the Stony Shore, underscoring its role as a contested and war-torn landscape.\n\nThe Stony Shore is also referenced in Asha Greyjoy's agreements, hinting at its political and tactical relevance among the Ironborn leadership.
