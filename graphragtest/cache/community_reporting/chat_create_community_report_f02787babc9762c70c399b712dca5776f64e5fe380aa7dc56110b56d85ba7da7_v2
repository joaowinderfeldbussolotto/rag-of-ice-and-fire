Worshipped by the Brotherhood Without Banners, R'hllor is revered as a god of light, fire, and good, standing in opposition to the Great Other, a malevolent force in the faith followed by Melisandre and her adherents. Thoros of Myr, a red priest, is a devoted follower of R'hllor and is closely associated with the miraculous resurrections of Beric Dondarrion, further cementing the deity's connection to life and renewal. Melisandre, another influential follower, leads a group of devotees who uphold R'hllor as their supreme god, emphasizing his role as a bringer of light and a protector against darkness. The Lord of Light is thus central to the spiritual practices of both Thoros and Beric Dondarrion, as well as the broader Brotherhood Without Banners, who see him as a guiding force in their struggles. This deity embodies themes of hope, divine power, and the eternal conflict between light and darkness.\",6\r\n742,AMORY LORCH,\"Ser Amory Lorch is a knight and commander serving under Lord Tywin Lannister, known for his brutal and ruthless tactics. He leads a group of 300 men, tasked with setting fire to locations in the Riverlands and conducting raids, including an attack on a holdfast where Arya Stark is staying, leaving corpses in his wake. Lorch is responsible for the death of Yoren, a member of the Night's Watch, and is rumored to have killed Beric Dondarrion at Rushing Falls, though reports of Dondarrion's death are later proven false. He is also implicated in the infamous murder of Elia Martell and her children during the sack of King’s Landing, though his direct involvement remains a subject of speculation.\n\nAs a Lannister raider, Lorch is notorious for his cruelty, engaging in acts of rape, burning, and butchering. Following Tywin Lannister’s departure, he is appointed castellan of Harrenhal, where he imprisons Northmen in the Widow’s Tower. His arrival at Harrenhal is marked by the presence of Jaqen H’ghar and other prisoners, further cementing his role as a key enforcer of Lannister authority. Lorch’s actions reflect the harsh and merciless nature of the Lannister war campaign, making him one of the most feared figures in the conflict.\",13\r\n1557,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,\"The Brotherhood Without Banners is a group of outlaws operating primarily in the Riverlands, known for their resistance against the Lannisters. Led by Beric Dondarrion, a charismatic and resilient figure, the brotherhood is also guided by Thoros of Myr, a red priest who plays a significant role in their activities. Initially formed as a band of outlaws, they are deeply involved in the conflicts plaguing the Riverlands, often clashing with Lannister forces and other adversaries.\n\nAt various points, the Brotherhood Without Banners has been associated with key locations and events, including their stay at The Peach brothel and their activities near High Heart, a place of mystical significance. Their movements and actions are often driven by their search for justice and vengeance, as well as their loyalty to Dondarrion. Despite their outlaw status, they operate with a sense of purpose, often targeting those they perceive as oppressors or enemies of the smallfolk.\n\nThe group’s dynamic shifts over time, particularly as they navigate leadership changes and evolving goals. Their involvement in the broader political and military landscape of the Riverlands underscores their importance as both a military force and a symbol of resistance. The Brotherhood Without Banners remains a notable faction, marked by their defiance of authority and their commitment to their cause.\",12\r\n313,THOROS OF MYR,\"Thoros of Myr is a red priest and warrior-priest known for his devotion to the Lord of Light, R'hllor, and his distinctive flaming sword. Originally sent to the Seven Kingdoms to spread the faith of R'hllor, he became renowned for his martial prowess, particularly after scaling the walls of Pyke with his flaming blade. Over time, Thoros underwent a transformation, shifting from a more worldly existence to a more spiritual one, fully embracing his role as a servant of the Lord of Light.\n\nHe is a key figure in the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of outlaws turned vigilantes who oppose the injustices of the war-torn realm. Thoros played a crucial role in saving Beric Dondarrion, the leader of the Brotherhood, and is known for his ability to resurrect him through the power of R'hllor. Together, they employ hit-and-run tactics to disrupt the forces of the Lannisters and others, particularly targeting Tywin Lannister’s foraging parties. Thoros is also involved in the Brotherhood’s mission to bring Ser Gregor Clegane to justice for his atrocities.\n\nUnlike many warriors, Thoros is noted for his fairness, often paying villagers for what he and his companions took, a practice that set him apart from others. His actions and leadership make him a target for figures like Bonifer Hasty, whom Jaime Lannister commands to kill Thoros if captured. Additionally, there are suspicions that Thoros may have been hiding with Yoren’s group at some point, further linking him to the Brotherhood’s activities.\n\nThoros is also known for his role in informing Brienne of Tarth about the Brotherhood Without Banners, highlighting his continued involvement in the group’s operations. His reputation as a warrior is solidified by his victory in a melee, where his skill with the flaming sword set him apart. Despite his past as a more secular figure, Thoros of Myr is now a devoted follower of R'hllor, using his abilities to fight for justice and the faith he represents.\",8\r\n296,BERIC DONDARRION,\"Beric Dondarrion, also known as the Lightning Lord, is a prominent knight and lord who plays a significant role in the conflicts of Westeros. He is the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a guerrilla faction that opposes the Lannister forces and fights for justice. Beric is renowned for his resilience, having been reported killed multiple times, including by Amory Lorch and the Bloody Mummers, yet he continues to reappear, earning him the eerie moniker \"\"Lord of Corpses.\"\"\n\nOriginally serving under the king's banner, Beric was sent by Ned Stark to dispense the king's justice against Gregor Clegane, marking his shift from a traditional knight to a rebel leader. He leads raids and ambushes against Lord Tywin Lannister's forces, particularly targeting their foraging parties and supply lines. His band is accused of raiding Saltpans, and he is sought by both Gregor Clegane and the Lannisters, who see him as a persistent threat.\n\nBeric is also a figure of intrigue and mystery. He is rumored to be associated with Yoren's group and is sought by the Brotherhood Without Banners themselves, adding to the legends surrounding his survival. Despite his outlaw status, he maintains a sense of justice, as seen when he judges Sandor Clegane, who later joins his band. His leadership and actions make him a key figure in the resistance against the Lannisters, and he is both feared and respected by his enemies.\n\nAdditionally, Beric is a figure of interest to various characters. Jeyne expresses willingness to marry him immediately, while Jaime Lannister requests his capture. Merrett Frey demands to see him before his execution, though Beric is notably absent during that event, as he is \"\"needed elsewhere.\"\" His whereabouts are often uncertain, and his movements are closely watched by both allies and foes.\n\nIn summary, Beric Dondarrion is a complex and enduring figure—a knight turned outlaw leader, a symbol of resistance, and a man whose death is repeatedly defied, making him one of the most intriguing characters in the realm.\",24\r\n295,MUD GATE,\"The Mud Gate is a prominent city gate in King’s Landing, serving as a key entry and exit point within the capital’s fortifications. It is notably associated with several significant events and characters from the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series. Beric Dondarrion, a knight and leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, arrives at the Mud Gate at one point, marking it as a location of strategic or narrative importance. Additionally, Arya Stark, during her time in King’s Landing, frequently checks the Mud Gate, suggesting its role in her observations or movements within the city.\n\nThe gate also holds military significance, as it is where Tyrion Lannister observes a battle and witnesses the devastating effects of wildfire, a volatile and destructive substance used in warfare. This event underscores the Mud Gate’s role in the defense and conflicts of King’s Landing, particularly during times of siege or attack. The gate’s name likely derives from its proximity to muddy or less fortified terrain, distinguishing it from other gates in the city. Overall, the Mud Gate is a multifaceted location, intertwined with both the daily life and pivotal moments of King’s Landing’s history.\",2\r\n914,BURTON CRAKEHALL,Burton Crakehall is a knight who was killed by Beric Dondarrion in an ambush,1\r\n1012,HOUSE DONDARRION,A noble house with a purple lightning bolt on black banner,1\r\n1989,LIGHTNING LORD'S BAND,\"A group led by Beric Dondarrion, accused of raiding Saltpans\",1\r\n1990,LORD TARLY,A noble spreading rumors to turn smallfolk against Beric Dondarrion,1\r\n2034,LADY AMEREI,,1\r\n1102,HOLDFAST,A fortified location attacked by Amory Lorch and his men,1\r\n1406,WIDOW'S TOWER,The Widow's Tower is a location in Harrenhal where the northmen are imprisoned,1\r\n1576,HIGH HEART,\"High Heart is an ancient and significant location in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*.

The site holds particular importance to the children of the forest, an ancient and enigmatic race that once inhabited the land. High Heart is visited by Arya Stark and the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of outlaws and warriors who operate outside the traditional feudal system. The area is shrouded in an aura of mystery, with its ruins hinting at a forgotten past and its sacred status suggesting deep spiritual connections to the old gods and the magic of the children of the forest.

As the former leader of this outlaw group, he is deeply associated with their cause and the worship of the Lord of Light, a deity central to their beliefs. Beric is depicted as a charismatic and resilient figure, guiding the Brotherhood in their mission to protect the smallfolk and oppose injustice. Additionally, he plays a role in explaining Arya Stark's situation to an old dwarf woman, further illustrating his involvement with the outlaws and their activities.

Revered in certain cultures, the Great Other embodies the forces of cold and shadow, standing in direct opposition to R'hllor's warmth and life-giving essence. This deity is often associated with the harsh, unyielding nature of winter and the relentless advance of darkness, symbolizing the struggle between opposing cosmic forces. Followers of R'hllor view the Great Other as a malevolent entity, representing the ultimate adversary in their spiritual and philosophical beliefs. The conflict between these two deities is central to the mythologies that depict the eternal battle between light and darkness, life and death.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2006,ARYA,BATTLE OF THE HOLDFAST,Arya participates in the battle and fights on the walls,148\r\n1848,RH'LLOR,STANNIS,Stannis follows the god R'hllor and is proclaimed as his chosen champion by Melisandre,90\r\n2015,AMORY LORCH,TYWIN LANNISTER,Amory Lorch is a bannerman to Tywin Lannister,61\r\n3167,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,ARYA STARK,Arya Stark is traveling with the Brotherhood Without Banners,59\r\n3249,THOROS OF MYR,BERIC DONDARRION,Thoros of Myr serves the same deity as Beric Dondarrion and supports him,32\r\n480,BERIC DONDARRION,TOURNEY OF THE HAND,Beric Dondarrion participates in the Tourney of the Hand,28\r\n479,MUD GATE,BERIC DONDARRION,Beric Dondarrion arrives at the Mud Gate,26\r\n1786,BERIC DONDARRION,BURTON CRAKEHALL,Beric Dondarrion killed Burton Crakehall in an ambush,25\r\n2013,BERIC DONDARRION,HOUSE DONDARRION,Beric Dondarrion is a member of House Dondarrion,25\r\n3976,BERIC DONDARRION,LIGHTNING LORD'S BAND,Beric Dondarrion is the leader of the Lightning Lord's band,25\r\n3977,BERIC DONDARRION,LORD TARLY,Lord Tarly spreads rumors to turn smallfolk against Beric Dondarrion,25\r\n4023,BERIC DONDARRION,LADY AMEREI,Lady Amerei begs Jaime to help defeat Beric Dondarrion,25\r\n2155,AMORY LORCH,HOLDFAST,\"Amory Lorch attacked the holdfast, leaving corpses behind\",14\r\n2815,AMORY LORCH,WIDOW'S TOWER,Amory Lorch imprisons the northmen in the Widow's Tower at Harrenhal,14\r\n3165,HIGH HEART,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,The Brotherhood Without Banners visits High Heart,13\r\n3166,ACORN HALL,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,The Brotherhood Without Banners visits Acorn Hall,13\r\n3169,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,LYMOND LYCHESTER,The Brotherhood Without Banners visits Lord Lymond Lychester,13\r\n3170,BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS,LADY OF THE LEAVES,The Brotherhood Without Banners consults the Lady of the Leaves,13\r\n3108,DONDARRION,THOROS OF MYR,\"Thoros of Myr saved Dondarrion, and they are both part of the Brotherhood Without Banners\",9\r\n3110,BERIC,RH'LLOR,\"Beric and the Brotherhood Without Banners follow the Lord of Light, R'hllor\",8\r\n2020,QYLE,BATTLE OF THE HOLDFAST,Qyle is killed during the battle,4\r\n3202,RH'ALLOR,GREAT OTHER,R'hllor and the Great Other are opposing gods in a cosmic struggle,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
