As the defensive force of the capital, they play a crucial role in upholding the law and ensuring the city's security. The organization is led by prominent figures, including Janos Slynt, who initially commands them, and later Jacelyn Bywater, who takes over leadership.\n\nThe City Watch is a significant entity in the political landscape of King's Landing. Ned Stark seeks their support through Littlefinger, highlighting their influence in the city's affairs. However, their loyalty is not absolute; they are known to betray Ned by siding with Cersei Lannister during a critical moment, demonstrating their shifting allegiances. Despite this, a portion of the Gold Cloaks remains partially loyal to Tyrion Lannister, who views them as both a resource and a potential problem. Tyrion engages with the City Watch, particularly through discussions with Janos Slynt, and tasks them with assisting in his projects, including the search and repurposing of resources.\n\nThe City Watch's role extends beyond mere law enforcement, as they are also involved in broader military and logistical operations within the city. Their actions and loyalties often reflect the complex and volatile political environment of King's Landing, making them a pivotal force in the capital's governance and stability.\",5\r\n286,JANOS SLYNT,\"Janos Slynt is a controversial and polarizing figure in the political and military landscape of Westeros. Initially serving as the Commander of the City Watch (the gold cloaks) in King’s Landing, he was known for his involvement in bribery, political maneuvering, and brutal enforcement of the law. He played a significant role in the execution of Eddard Stark, Sansa Stark’s father, and was a staunch supporter of King Joffrey Baratheon’s harsh judgments, earning criticism from figures like Tywin Lannister. Despite his questionable methods, he was rewarded with Harrenhal and a seat on the small council for his loyalty to the crown.\n\nSlynt’s tenure as Commander of the City Watch ended when Tyrion Lannister, acting as Hand of the King, exiled him to the Night’s Watch for his corruption and incompetence. There, he became a candidate for Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, though his reputation for cruelty and political scheming followed him. He clashed with Jon Snow, whom he accused of wrongdoing and sought to punish, further cementing his role as an antagonist within the Watch.\n\nHis defiance and continued insubordination led to his eventual execution by Jon Snow, who beheaded him for refusing orders. His death was later referenced by Alliser Thorne, highlighting his lasting infamy. Slynt’s legacy is one of ambition, corruption, and a ruthless pursuit of power, making him a memorable yet reviled figure in the history of both King’s Landing and the Night’s Watch.\",17\r\n176,ILYN PAYNE,\"Ser Ilyn Payne is a formidable and feared figure in the realm, serving as the King's Justice and royal executioner. Known for his grim efficiency, he is a man of few words—literally, as his tongue was ripped out, rendering him mute. Despite his inability to speak, his presence alone commands respect and dread, given his role in carrying out the crown's most severe sentences.\n\nA knight summoned by Jaime Lannister, Ser Ilyn is a loyal member of Jaime's command, renowned for his execution skills. His most infamous act is the beheading of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, with the legendary sword Ice, an event that marks a turning point in the political turmoil of the realm. This execution also makes him responsible for the death of Sansa and Arya Stark's father, further cementing his reputation as a ruthless enforcer of the crown's will.\n\nSer Ilyn is present during key moments of conflict, including the battle in the Queen's Ballroom, where his role as an executioner underscores his proximity to power and violence. His involvement in Ned Stark's death is particularly notable, as Stark had previously refused to let him kill Lady, the direwolf, showcasing the tension between justice and mercy in the brutal world they inhabit.\n\nTyrion Lannister, at one point, considers summoning Ser Ilyn, highlighting the executioner's significance even among the high-ranking members of the court. His actions and presence serve as a constant reminder of the harsh realities of justice in a kingdom where loyalty and power often dictate life and death. Ser Ilyn Payne remains a symbol of the crown's authority, feared and respected in equal measure.\",8\r\n179,MAD KING AERYS,The former king who ordered Ser Ilyn Payne's tongue to be ripped out,1\r\n923,ALLAR DEEM,\"Allar Deem is a character known for his brutal and loyal nature, making him a notable figure in the context of the City Watch.

His association with Janos Slynt, a prominent and often controversial figure, further underscores his role within the organization. Additionally, Allar Deem is connected to Chataya, though the specifics of their involvement remain unclear. This relationship hints at a broader network of interactions or alliances that Deem may have had beyond his duties in the City Watch.
