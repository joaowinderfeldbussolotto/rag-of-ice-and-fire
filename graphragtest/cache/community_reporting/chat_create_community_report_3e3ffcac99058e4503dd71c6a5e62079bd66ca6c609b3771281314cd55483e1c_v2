Led by Tywin Lannister, the family is deeply entrenched in the conflicts and power struggles of the Seven Kingdoms. They are identified by their distinctive banners and are often criticized for their financial dealings, particularly with the Iron Bank, to which the Crown owes a significant debt.\n\nThe Lannisters have been falsely accused of murdering Jon Arryn, as claimed in a letter by Lysa Arryn, and are blamed for the war and the death of Ned Stark, fueling their long-standing feud with House Stark. Their conflicts extend to House Tully, with whom they are engaged in a bitter struggle, including the siege of Riverrun, a key stronghold they seek to control. The family is also involved in the pillaging of the Riverlands and has been responsible for the destruction of villages, further escalating tensions.\n\nAllied with House Bolton and later the Tyrells, the Lannisters have played a pivotal role in major events, including the sack of Kingâ€™s Landing. They hold significant captives, such as Wylis Manderly, and have occupied strategic locations like Harrenhal and Darry. Their actions have caused immense suffering, particularly for figures like Arya Stark, who holds them responsible for her losses.\n\nDespite their controversies, the Lannisters remain a dominant force in Westeros, wielding power through both military might and political maneuvering. Their ambitions and ruthless tactics are often compared to those of other powerful houses, such as the Tyrells, solidifying their reputation as one of the most formidable families in the realm.\",28\r\n1226,TULLYS,\"The Tullys are a notable family referenced in historical and literary contexts.

This oath underscores the family's importance and suggests a complex history of alliances, conflicts, or personal bonds. While details about their origins, prominence, or other interactions are not provided, the references to the Tullys indicate their relevance in the broader context of the story or historical account in which they appear.

His familial ties also extend to Catelyn Stark, as he is her uncle and once attempted to warn her about Lysa Arrynâ€™s unstable nature.\n\nDespite his noble lineage and military prowess, Brynden is a fugitive, sought after for his defiance and actions during conflicts. His reputation as the Blackfish, a name derived from his familyâ€™s sigil and his own stubborn nature, underscores his resilience and independence.\n\nThere is also a mystical aspect to Bryndenâ€™s legacy, as some accounts suggest he is the former identity of the Three-Eyed Crow, a lord who transcended his mortal life to become a mystical figure.
