Initially a captive, he provides limited information to Catelyn Stark but later plays a more active role in diplomatic efforts. As an envoy, he meets with Tyrion Lannister to discuss Robb Stark’s peace terms and is tasked with delivering these terms to Queen Cersei in King’s Landing. Additionally, he is sent back to Robb Stark with the Lannisters’ counter-demands for peace, acting as an intermediary in the tense negotiations between the warring factions.\n\nCleos Frey also escorts Jaime Lannister to King’s Landing, further demonstrating his role as a trusted figure in Lannister affairs. Despite his initial captivity, he becomes an instrumental figure in the attempts to broker peace, though his efforts are ultimately overshadowed by the broader conflict. His dual heritage and knighthood lend credibility to his role as a messenger, though his loyalty remains primarily with the Lannisters. His actions highlight the complex and often futile diplomatic maneuvers during the war, as neither side fully commits to the terms he carries.\",13\r\n905,TION FREY,\"Tion Frey is a member of House Frey and a squire, notable for his involvement in the political and military conflicts of his time. He is the brother of Cleos Frey and was captured by Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings. Tion Frey became a significant figure in the exchange negotiations between House Stark and House Frey, as his captivity was mentioned in the peace terms. However, his life was cut short when he was murdered by Rickard Karstark, a Stark bannerman, in an act of vengeance. This event further escalated tensions between the warring factions. Tion Frey's role, though brief, underscores the brutal and unpredictable nature of the conflict, as well as the personal vendettas that fueled the war. His death also highlights the fragility of diplomatic efforts during this tumultuous period.\",4\r\n904,WILLEM LANNISTER,\"Willem Lannister is a squire of House Lannister who became a significant figure during the War of the Five Kings. Captured by Robb Stark, he was held as a prisoner and later mentioned in the peace terms between Robb Stark and the Lannisters. His captivity made him a key figure in negotiations, with proposals for his exchange as part of broader diplomatic efforts. However, his fate took a dark turn when he was murdered by Rickard Karstark, a vengeful northern lord seeking retribution for the deaths of his sons at the hands of the Lannisters. This act of violence not only ended Willem’s life but also strained relations between Robb Stark and his bannermen, as Karstark’s actions defied Stark’s authority. Willem Lannister’s role, though brief, highlights the brutal and unpredictable nature of the conflict, as well as the personal vendettas that often overshadowed political strategy. His death underscored the fragility of alliances and the high stakes of the war.\",4\r\n901,GENNA,\"Genna Lannister is a prominent member of House Lannister, known for her sharp tongue and strong presence within the family. She is the sister of Lord Tywin Lannister and Kevan Lannister, making her the aunt of Jaime and Cersei Lannister. Genna is married to Lord Emmon Frey, with whom she has at least one son, Ser Cleos Frey.\n\nAs Jaime’s aunt, Genna plays a significant role in family matters, often visiting him to discuss the Lannisters' affairs. She is also Cersei’s aunt and was once involved in discussions about Cersei’s betrothal to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, highlighting her influence in political and familial decisions. Genna’s relationships with her siblings and nieces and nephews underscore her importance in the Lannister dynasty, where she is respected for her wit and involvement in key family matters. Her marriage to Emmon Frey further ties House Lannister to House Frey, reinforcing political alliances. Despite her sometimes abrasive demeanor, Genna is a formidable and respected figure within her family.\",4\r\n561,RICKARD KARSTARK,\"Lord Rickard Karstark is a prominent northern lord and the leader of House Karstark, a bannerman sworn to House Stark. Known for his fierce loyalty to Robb Stark and his adherence to the old gods, he initially served as a key supporter in Robb’s campaign during the War of the Five Kings, participating in the council at Riverrun. However, his story is marked by tragedy and vengeance.\n\nRickard Karstark’s sons were killed by Jaime Lannister, an act that plunged him into deep grief and rage. Consumed by his desire for retribution, he defied Robb Stark’s authority by murdering two Lannister prisoners, Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, in cold blood. This act of vengeance led to a severe conflict with Catelyn Stark, who opposed his actions, and ultimately resulted in his execution by Robb Stark for betraying his commands and killing prisoners. His death made it impossible for Vargo Hoat to return Jaime Lannister to him, further complicating the war’s dynamics.\n\nDespite his loyalty to the Starks, Rickard Karstark’s unchecked temper and thirst for revenge led to his downfall, illustrating the destructive consequences of personal vendettas in the midst of war. His legacy remains one of tragedy, as his actions not only cost him his life but also weakened the northern cause.\",15\r\n562,HARRION,\"Harrion Karstark is one of the sons of Rickard Karstark and a brother of Alys Karstark.

He is the father of Cleos Frey, bearing the distinctive features common to the Frey lineage. Emmon is married to Genna Lannister, a union that ties him closely to the powerful House Lannister. As part of this alliance, he was granted Riverrun by the Lannisters as a reward, though his tenure over the castle has been contentious. He is noted for his complaints about the damage inflicted on Riverrun during its siege and his outrage upon learning that he is a vassal of Petyr Baelish, reflecting his dissatisfaction with the shifting power structures in the region.\n\nEmmon Frey holds a position in the line of succession within House Frey, underscoring his importance within the family. His interactions with other nobles, such as Daven Lannister, have been strained, as his actions and demeanor have tested the patience of his allies. Despite his grievances, Emmon remains a key figure in the Frey family, balancing his loyalty to House Lannister with his own ambitions and frustrations. His legacy is further cemented through his son, Ser Cleos Frey, who continues the family’s martial traditions. Emmon’s story is one of political maneuvering, familial duty, and the challenges of maintaining power in a turbulent landscape.\",6\r\n564,TORRHEN,\"Torrhen is a character mentioned in historical texts, identified as a member or associate of the Stark family.
