Originally a wildling woman from beyond the Wall, she is captured by Robb Stark and the direwolves after an attack on Bran, becoming the sole survivor of her group. Despite her warrior background and scars from fighting men, Osha is spared and taken into service at Winterfell, where she becomes a servant or companion to House Stark.\n\nOsha is known for her strength and resilience, often carrying Bran Stark and engaging in deep conversations with him about his dreams, the old gods, and the supernatural threats of the north, such as the Others and giants. She shares stories about the north and advises Bran on the dangers lurking beyond the Wall, including her observations of the red comet and the significance of the direwolves. Her bond with Bran and Rickon is evident, as she interacts with them frequently, even assisting Bran during feasts and discussing his visions.\n\nDespite her loyalty to the Stark children, Osha’s relationship with Theon Greyjoy is strained. She initially joins his service at Winterfell, much to Bran’s disappointment, but her allegiance remains with the Starks. When Theon betrays House Stark, Osha refuses to harm the direwolves and later begs Robb Stark for mercy, pledging her service to him. Her defiance and survival instincts are further highlighted when she escapes with Bran and Rickon during the chaos at Winterfell.\n\nIn a pivotal moment, Osha takes charge of Rickon and Shaggydog, sending others away and leading them south, possibly to White Harbor, to ensure their safety. Her actions reflect her protective nature and deep connection to the Stark children, despite her wildling origins. Osha’s character is defined by her strength, wisdom, and unwavering commitment to those she cares for, making her a memorable figure in the story.\",21\r\n565,GAGE,\"GAGE is a man associated with Winterfell, known for his multiple roles and notable experiences within the castle. He serves as the cook of Winterfell, contributing to the daily operations of the household. Additionally, GAGE has a relationship with Osha, a wildling woman who once resided in Winterfell, suggesting a personal connection beyond his professional duties.\n\nOne of the most significant events in GAGE's life occurred when he was bitten by Shaggydog, the direwolf belonging to Rickon Stark, during an incident in the crypts of Winterfell. This encounter marks a dramatic moment in his story, highlighting the dangers and unpredictability of life in the castle. Despite the severity of such an incident, GAGE's survival and continued presence in Winterfell underscore his resilience and importance to the household.\n\nOverall, GAGE is a multifaceted figure in Winterfell, balancing his responsibilities as a cook with his personal relationships and the challenges he has faced, including the direwolf attack. His experiences reflect the complex and often perilous environment of Winterfell during this tumultuous period.\",2\r\n576,FREE FOLK,\"The Free Folk, also known as the wildlings, are a group of people residing beyond the Wall, a massive barrier separating them from the Seven Kingdoms. Unlike the inhabitants of the Seven Kingdoms, the Free Folk are not subject to its laws or governance, living instead by their own customs and traditions. Their society is characterized by a fierce independence and a deep connection to the harsh, untamed lands they inhabit.\n\nThe Free Folk are often hunted by wargs, particularly in the haunted forest, a perilous region beyond the Wall. This constant threat adds to the dangers they face in their already challenging environment. Despite these hardships, the Free Folk maintain a resilient and self-sufficient way of life, relying on their knowledge of the land and their skills in survival. Their existence is marked by a stark contrast to the more structured and hierarchical societies south of the Wall, embodying a spirit of freedom and autonomy.\",2\r\n875,GIANTS,\"The GIANTS are mythical beings referenced in Old Nan's stories, with their existence confirmed by Osha, who claims to have seen them.

The GIANTS are depicted as formidable and enigmatic creatures, occupying a space between myth and reality in the narratives where they appear. Their interactions with humans, such as rangers, suggest a history of confrontation, further cementing their reputation as powerful and sometimes hostile entities. Despite their mythical status, the confirmation of their existence by figures like Osha adds a layer of credibility to their legend, making them a fascinating subject of both storytelling and speculation.\",2\r\n425,WILDLING,\"Wildlings are a group to which Osha belongs, who claims she broke no oaths as she is not bound by their rules\",1\r\n249,SHAGGYDOG,\"Shaggydog is one of the direwolves belonging to the Stark family, specifically associated with Rickon Stark.
