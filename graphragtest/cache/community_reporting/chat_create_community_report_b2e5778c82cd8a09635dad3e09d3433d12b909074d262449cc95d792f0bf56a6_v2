He is known for wearing the distinctive helm of Sandor Clegane, which adds to his fearsome appearance. LEM is closely associated with key figures in the Brotherhood, including Beric Dondarrion, whom he knows to still be alive, and Tom of Sevenstreams and Anguy, with whom he was present when they discovered Arya Stark, Gendry, and Hot Pie.\n\nLEM plays a significant role in the Brotherhood’s actions, particularly in their pursuit of justice against those they deem guilty. Notably, he is involved in the execution of Merrett Frey, where he ties the noose around Merrett’s neck, ensuring his demise. This act underscores LEM’s ruthless and uncompromising nature when dealing with the enemies of the Brotherhood. His presence and actions reflect the Brotherhood’s broader mission of vengeance and retribution against those who have wronged the innocent, particularly the Freys, who are infamous for their betrayal at the Red Wedding.\n\nLEM’s character is marked by his loyalty to the Brotherhood and his willingness to carry out its harsh judgments. His involvement in key events, such as the discovery of Arya and her companions and the execution of Merrett Frey, highlights his importance within the group. Despite his outlaw status, LEM operates with a sense of purpose, aligning himself with the Brotherhood’s cause and contributing to their efforts to uphold their own brand of justice in a lawless world.\",3\r\n1552,TOM,\"Tom, also known as Tom Sevenstrings, is a multifaceted character associated with the Brotherhood Without Banners. He is a musician or bard, as evidenced by his connection to a song requested by an old dwarf woman. Tom plays a significant role in the group’s activities, often serving as an informant and guide. He is the one who tells Arya Stark about the Brotherhood’s destination, demonstrating his knowledge and involvement in their plans.\n\nAs a member of the Brotherhood Without Banners, Tom is well-informed about the group’s leadership, including the fact that Beric Dondarrion is still alive. However, he also operates as an outlaw, as seen when he informs Merrett Frey about Beric’s absence, though this may be part of a larger deception. Tom is deeply involved in the Brotherhood’s justice, as he is one of the characters who leads Merrett Frey to his execution. During this confrontation, he reveals the presence of a resurrected woman, likely Lady Stoneheart (Catelyn Stark), further emphasizing his role in the Brotherhood’s darker operations.\n\nTom’s dual nature—as both a musician and a ruthless outlaw—highlights his complexity. He is not only a performer but also a key figure in the Brotherhood’s enforcement of justice, making him a memorable and intriguing character in the narrative.\",2\r\n1809,MERRETT,\"Merrett Frey is a character from the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, notable for his involvement in the Frey family's political machinations. As a member of House Frey, he is implicated in the infamous Red Wedding, a brutal massacre orchestrated by his family against House Stark and their allies. Following the event, Merrett is accused of complicity in the betrayal and is subsequently hanged by Lem and Tom, outlaws seeking vengeance for the atrocities committed by the Freys.\n\nMerrett is also identified as the father of Little Walder Frey, whose death becomes a point of contention within the family. His role in the conflict underscores the Frey family's ruthless pursuit of power and their willingness to betray allies for political gain. Merrett’s fate serves as a grim reminder of the consequences of the Freys' treachery, as their actions provoke retaliation from those they wronged. His character embodies the themes of betrayal, vengeance, and the cyclical nature of violence in the series.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3080,LEM,ARYA,Lem was with Tom of Sevenstreams when they discovered Arya,148\r\n3176,LEM,TOM,\"LEM and TOM are members of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group known for their vigilante actions in the Riverlands.
