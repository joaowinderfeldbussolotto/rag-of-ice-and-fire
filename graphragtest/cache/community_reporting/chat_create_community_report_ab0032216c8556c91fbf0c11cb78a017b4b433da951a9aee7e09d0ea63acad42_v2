Daenerys faces numerous internal conflicts and external threats, including a siege by Yunkish forces, who aim to starve the city into submission through famine and disease. During the siege, trebuchets are used to fling corpses over the walls, adding to the city's turmoil.\n\nMeereen is a hub of political intrigue, with figures like Barristan Selmy and Hizdahr zo Loraq playing crucial roles in navigating the city's crises. The Harpy's Sons, a resistance group, commit murders, including attacks on the Unsullied, Daenerys' elite guard. The city is also a cultural center, hosting events such as the fighting pits, where Daenerys interacts with local traditions. Additionally, she visits sick Astapori refugees who have fled to Meereen, highlighting the city's role as a refuge.\n\nThe city is a destination for various characters, including Quentyn Martell, who seeks to reach it despite the dangers, and Victarion Greyjoy, who travels there with his own ambitions. Meereen is also a place of commerce, where Dothraki captives are sold for gold, and where Daenerys hosts influential figures like Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The presence of her dragons and the Unsullied further underscores the city's strategic and symbolic importance.\n\nUnder Daenerys' rule, Meereen becomes a focal point of power struggles, social tensions, and military conflicts, making it a central location in the broader narrative of Slaver's Bay.

His deep involvement in Meereenese traditions and customs further solidifies his standing as a knowledgeable and respected official within the city's political structure.\n\nLater, Reznak transitions into serving Daenerys Targaryen as her seneschal, assisting her in governance and court matters. Despite his administrative competence, he becomes a figure of suspicion when Daenerys begins to question his loyalty, suspecting him of being a traitor. His dual roles under both Hizdahr and Daenerys place him at the center of Meereen's shifting political landscape, where his actions and allegiances are closely scrutinized.

His political maneuvering also involves sidelining influential figures such as Ser Barristan Selmy, reflecting his strategic approach to consolidating power and influence.\n\nHizdahr is proposed as a suitor to Daenerys Targaryen as part of a political strategy to end the attacks by the Harpy's Sons, a resistance group opposing her rule. Despite Daenerys initially refusing other suitors, such as Quentyn Martell, she ultimately agrees to marry Hizdahr, recognizing the potential benefits of the alliance for Meereen's stability. Their marriage solidifies his position as a central figure in the city's leadership, and he eventually becomes the king of Meereen, tasked with managing the delicate balance of power among various factions.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Hizdahr zo Loraq remains a controversial yet pivotal figure, balancing tradition and political necessity in his efforts to govern Meereen and secure its future.

Despite these promises, the group remains a persistent and destabilizing force, undermining Daenerys’ efforts to govern and maintain order in the city.

Her governance is marked by efforts to abolish slavery and reform its oppressive systems, though this leads to resistance from former slaveholders. Additionally, Daenerys interacts with the Astapori, a group outside Meereen, further expanding her influence in the region.\n\nContrary to earlier intentions, Daenerys does not ultimately sell captives in Meereen for gold, as her principles shift toward liberation rather than exploitation.
