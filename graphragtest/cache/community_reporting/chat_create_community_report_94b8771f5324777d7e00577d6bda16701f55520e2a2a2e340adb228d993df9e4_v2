Captured by Robb Stark, he was held as a prisoner and later mentioned in the peace terms between Robb Stark and the Lannisters. His captivity made him a key figure in negotiations, with proposals for his exchange as part of broader diplomatic efforts. However, his fate took a dark turn when he was murdered by Rickard Karstark, a vengeful northern lord seeking retribution for the deaths of his sons at the hands of the Lannisters. This act of violence not only ended Willem’s life but also strained relations between Robb Stark and his bannermen, as Karstark’s actions defied Stark’s authority. Willem Lannister’s role, though brief, highlights the brutal and unpredictable nature of the conflict, as well as the personal vendettas that often overshadowed political strategy. His death underscored the fragility of alliances and the high stakes of the war.\",4\r\n561,RICKARD KARSTARK,\"Lord Rickard Karstark is a prominent northern lord and the leader of House Karstark, a bannerman sworn to House Stark. Known for his fierce loyalty to Robb Stark and his adherence to the old gods, he initially served as a key supporter in Robb’s campaign during the War of the Five Kings, participating in the council at Riverrun. However, his story is marked by tragedy and vengeance.\n\nRickard Karstark’s sons were killed by Jaime Lannister, an act that plunged him into deep grief and rage. Consumed by his desire for retribution, he defied Robb Stark’s authority by murdering two Lannister prisoners, Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, in cold blood. This act of vengeance led to a severe conflict with Catelyn Stark, who opposed his actions, and ultimately resulted in his execution by Robb Stark for betraying his commands and killing prisoners. His death made it impossible for Vargo Hoat to return Jaime Lannister to him, further complicating the war’s dynamics.\n\nDespite his loyalty to the Starks, Rickard Karstark’s unchecked temper and thirst for revenge led to his downfall, illustrating the destructive consequences of personal vendettas in the midst of war. His legacy remains one of tragedy, as his actions not only cost him his life but also weakened the northern cause.\",15\r\n562,HARRION,\"Harrion Karstark is one of the sons of Rickard Karstark and a brother of Alys Karstark. Like his sister, he was taken captive, though the circumstances surrounding his capture are not fully detailed.

His fate as a captive suggests he may have been involved in the conflicts or political struggles that have plagued the North, particularly during the tumultuous events following the War of the Five Kings. While specific details about his role or actions are limited, his status as both a son of Rickard Karstark and a captive underscores the challenges faced by his family during this period.\",1\r\n691,DARYN HORNWOOD,\"Daryn Hornwood is a warrior who met his end during a significant conflict. He is notably remembered for intervening in a fight between Theon Greyjoy and Jaime Lannister, ultimately perishing in the process. His death is also mentioned in the broader context of the battle, where he is listed among other notable casualties, including the sons of House Karstark. Though his role in the conflict was brief, his actions highlight his bravery and loyalty, as he stepped into a dangerous situation in an attempt to influence its outcome. Daryn Hornwood’s demise serves as a reminder of the many lives lost in the tumultuous struggles of the time, marking him as one of the fallen warriors in a larger, tragic narrative.\",1\r\n1571,MURDER OF WILLEM LANNISTER AND TION FREY,The killing of two squires by Rickard Karstark in revenge for his sons' deaths,1\r\n564,TORRHEN,\"Torrhen is a character mentioned in historical texts, identified as a member or associate of the Stark family.
