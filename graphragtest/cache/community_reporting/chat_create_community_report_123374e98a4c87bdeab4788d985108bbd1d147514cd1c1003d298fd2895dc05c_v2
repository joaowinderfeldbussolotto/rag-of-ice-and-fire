Initially, she is a pregnant woman seeking to escape Craster’s Keep due to fear for her unborn son’s fate, as Craster’s sons are traditionally sacrificed to the White Walkers. After giving birth, she becomes a wet nurse for both her own child and Mance Rayder’s son, whom she is forced to take with her while leaving her own child behind—a decision that leaves her inconsolable.\n\nGilly’s journey intertwines with Samwell Tarly’s, as she asks him to take her away from Craster’s Keep for safety. She travels with Sam, Maester Aemon, and her infant son, seeking refuge beyond the Wall. Along the way, she grieves deeply for the child she was forced to abandon, and her sorrow is a recurring theme in her interactions with Sam. Their path leads them to Braavos, where Gilly remains distraught, and later to the Citadel in Oldtown, as part of Jon Snow’s plan to ensure her safety.\n\nJon Snow, recognizing the dangers she faces, arranges for her to be sent south, possibly to Oldtown, along with her baby and Mance Rayder’s child. At Castle Black, she nurses both infants, and her role as a caretaker is emphasized. Samwell Tarly, concerned for her well-being, considers her safety during his time at Horn Hill and continues to accompany her on her journey.\n\nThroughout her story, Gilly is depicted as a resilient yet vulnerable figure, shaped by loss and the harsh realities of life beyond the Wall. Her relationship with Samwell Tarly is one of mutual dependence, as they navigate the perils of their journey together.
