Over time, Cersei grew suspicious of Senelle, believing her to be a spy working for Margaery Tyrell's cousins, likely due to the political tensions and paranoia surrounding the Lannister and Tyrell factions. Despite her role as a trusted servant, Cersei's distrust led to dire consequences for Senelle. She became a subject of Qyburn's experiments, which were known for their brutal and often fatal nature. Unfortunately, Senelle did not survive these experiments, marking a grim end to her service in the Red Keep. Her story reflects the dangerous and unpredictable environment of court life under Cersei's rule, where suspicion and betrayal often led to tragic outcomes.\",2\r\n1473,QYBURN,\"Qyburn is a complex and multifaceted character in the political and military landscape of Westeros, primarily serving as a loyal advisor and maester to Cersei Lannister. Originally a defrocked and disgraced maester, he was stripped of his chains due to unethical practices, including necromancy and experimentation. Despite his controversial methods, he becomes a key figure in Cerseiâ€™s small council, offering his services and expertise to further her ambitions.\n\nQyburn first appears as a healer tending to Jaime Lannisterâ€™s wounds during his recuperation at Harrenhal, where he also sends a girl, Pia, to attend to Jaime. He later informs Jaime about Vargo Hoatâ€™s demands and the dire situation at Harrenhal, showcasing his role as both a healer and an informant. His loyalty to Cersei grows as he becomes deeply involved in her political schemes, often providing her with crucial information and advising her on matters such as sending men to the Wall, possibly as assassins.\n\nAs a necromancer and experimenter, Qyburn conducts disturbing experiments, most notably on Gregor Clegane, transforming him into an undead enforcer for Cersei. He also introduces Cersei to her new champion, further solidifying his role as a manipulative and resourceful advisor. Qyburnâ€™s influence extends to reporting on the actions of the Sparrows and reading letters from Walda to Roose Bolton, demonstrating his wide-reaching network of informants.\n\nDespite his controversial past, Qyburn is called upon by Brienne to aid Jaime when he nearly passes out, highlighting his medical skills. He also advises Cersei on replacing members of the Kingsguard and mentions having a champion to replace Loras Tyrell, reinforcing his strategic importance. As the Master of Whisperers, Qyburn engages in secretive and unethical practices, ensuring Cersei remains well-informed and powerful.\n\nIn summary, Qyburn is a disgraced yet highly capable maester who serves Cersei Lannister with unwavering loyalty, using his medical knowledge, political acumen, and unorthodox methods to advance her interests. His role as an advisor, healer, and experimenter makes him a pivotal and morally ambiguous figure in the realm.\",9\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3684,CERSEI,SENELLE,\"Cersei Lannister, a prominent figure in the political landscape of Westeros, harbors deep suspicions about Senelle, her personal maid.
