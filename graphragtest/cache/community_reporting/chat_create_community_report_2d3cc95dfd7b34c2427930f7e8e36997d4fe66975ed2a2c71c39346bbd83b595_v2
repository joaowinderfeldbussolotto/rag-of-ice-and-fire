Blind yet profoundly insightful, he is a trusted advisor to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and later to Jon Snow, offering guidance on leadership and the significance of Melisandreâ€™s prophecies. Aemon is revealed to be Aemon Targaryen, son of King Maekar I, a man of royal lineage who chose service over the throne, embodying the wisdom of sacrifice and duty.\n\nHe plays a crucial role in the Nightâ€™s Watch, treating injuries, interpreting ancient texts like the *Jade Compendium*, and advising on matters of great importance, such as Jonâ€™s leadership and the threat of the Others. Aemon intervenes in conflicts, such as preventing Janos Slynt from executing Jon and failing to persuade Slynt to relent in his accusations. His ravens serve as a vital communication network, capable of spreading news, including Jonâ€™s potential desertion.\n\nAs his health deteriorates, Aemon travels to the Citadel, where he is eventually replaced by Samwell Tarly. Despite his frailty, he remains a figure of authority, permitted to see imprisoned figures like Mance Rayder and offering counsel on the role of stewards in the Watch. His past is often discussed by Mormont, highlighting his deep connection to the realmâ€™s history and his wisdom in understanding the pain of difficult choices.

As the eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Sam was sent to the Nightâ€™s Watch due to his fatherâ€™s disapproval of his gentle personality and scholarly interests. Despite his initial struggles with training, Sam proves himself through his intelligence, kindness, and dedication to his duties.\n\nSam is known for his scholarly pursuits, particularly his interest in maps, ravens, and maester training. He handles ravens at Castle Black and interacts frequently with Jon Snow, offering wise counsel on leadership and family dynamics. His cowardice in battle contrasts with his sharp mind, making him a valuable but cautious member of the Nightâ€™s Watch.\n\nSam plays a key role in several significant events, including witnessing the mutiny at Crasterâ€™s Keep and investigating the unusual corpses found near the Wall. He is also involved in the dangerous journey beyond the Wall, where he fights wights and aids in the defense of his brothers. His observations and insights often prove crucial, such as when he notes peculiar details about the reanimated corpses.\n\nA loyal companion, Sam travels with Gilly and her infant son, as well as Maester Aemon, whom he cares for deeply. He considers sending Gilly to safety at Horn Hill and interacts with figures like Stannis Baratheon and Bran Stark. Sam is also tasked with escorting Maester Aemon to the Citadel in Oldtown to train as a maester, a journey that takes him through Braavos.\n\nThroughout his time in the Nightâ€™s Watch, Sam remains a steadfast friend to Jon Snow, attempting to dissuade him from deserting Castle Black and supporting him in leadership decisions. He receives a cracked warhorn from Jon and engages in discussions about Lightbringer and the Black Gate. Despite his reluctance toward violence, Samâ€™s bravery shines in moments of necessity, and his kindness earns him the respect of those around him.\n\nUltimately, Samwell Tarly is a complex figureâ€”intelligent, compassionate, and resilientâ€”whose contributions to the Nightâ€™s Watch and his relationships with key figures like Jon Snow, Gilly, and Maester Aemon define his character.\",35\r\n283,LORD RANDYLL TARLY,\"Lord Randyll Tarly is a prominent nobleman from House Tarly, known for his stern and unyielding character. He is the father of Samwell Tarly, whom he forced to join the Night's Watch due to his deep dissatisfaction with Sam's perceived weaknesses and lack of martial prowess. This decision reflects Randyll's rigid expectations of his heir and his belief in the traditional values of strength and duty.\n\nAs a loyal banner man to House Tyrell, Lord Randyll Tarly marched on King's Landing alongside Lord Mace Tyrell, demonstrating his commitment to his liege lord and the political alliances of the Reach. His actions underscore his role as a formidable military leader and a key figure in the power dynamics of Westeros. Randyll Tarly's reputation is marked by his disciplined and often harsh approach, both in his personal life and his political endeavors.\",2\r\n284,DICKON,\"Dickon Tarly is the second son of Lord Randyll Tarly, a prominent nobleman in the fictional world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*.

Dickon is noted for revealing a wager involving Brienne of Tarth, though the specifics of this bet are not fully detailed. As the second son, Dickon likely faced the pressures and expectations typical of noble-born children in a martial family like the Tarlys, known for their military prowess and strict adherence to duty.

This act highlights the characterâ€™s protective instincts and resourcefulness, even in the face of formidable adversaries.\n\nBeyond this heroic deed, the Cat of the Canals also represents a past identity or role that Arya reflects upon with a mix of nostalgia and introspection. It symbolizes a period of her life where she navigated the shadows of Braavos, honing her abilities and forging her path. The identity is intertwined with Aryaâ€™s broader transformation, marking a phase of survival, adaptation, and self-discovery.\n\nThe dual nature of the Cat of the Canalsâ€”both as a savior and a memoryâ€”underscores its importance in Aryaâ€™s story.
