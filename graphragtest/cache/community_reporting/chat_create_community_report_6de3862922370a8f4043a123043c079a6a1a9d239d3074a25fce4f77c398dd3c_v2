Named after Jon Arryn, he is often referred to as Arya’s half-brother, who gifted her the sword Needle and taught her valuable lessons about fighting. His mother is widely believed to be Wylla, though his true parentage remains ambiguous.\n\nJon joins the Night’s Watch, becoming a recruit at Castle Black, where he faces challenges from other recruits but is mentored by Donal Noye. He befriends Samwell Tarly, defending him and forming a close bond. As a steward to Commander Mormont and later Maester Aemon, Jon rises through the ranks, eventually becoming the 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch after a landslide victory. In this role, he handles political and military matters, including confrontations with Stannis Baratheon and Melisandre, and plays a key role in the defense of the realm.\n\nThroughout his time at the Wall, Jon interacts with notable figures such as Tyrion Lannister, Benjen Stark, and Craster, learning about the latter’s disturbing practices. He also investigates threats beyond the Wall, including the discovery of dragonglass weapons at the Fist of the First Men and the looming danger of Mance Rayder’s army. Jon is known for his association with his direwolf, Ghost, and experiences vivid wolf dreams.\n\nHis leadership is marked by both triumph and betrayal. After deciding to confront Ramsay Bolton, he is later betrayed by his own men. Despite these challenges, Jon remains a central figure in the Night’s Watch, working with allies like Stannis and addressing situations such as Gilly’s plight. His complex relationships with his family, particularly his half-siblings, and his ambiguous lineage add depth to his character, making him a pivotal figure in the broader conflicts of the realm.\",63\r\n1803,MORMONT'S RAVEN,\"Mormont's raven is a bird that lands on Jon's shoulder, symbolizing his connection to the late Lord Commander Mormont\",2\r\n1545,JARL,\"Jarl is a wildling leader and an experienced climber who plays a significant role in the events surrounding the Wall. Initially, he is known for his daring attempt to scale the Wall, a formidable and nearly impassable barrier. However, his fate takes a tragic turn when he dies during this perilous climb. Despite his demise, Jarl is also remembered for his alliance with Jon Snow, as he was part of the group of wildlings who joined Jon in climbing the Wall. This dual narrative highlights both his leadership among the wildlings and his ultimate sacrifice in the attempt to overcome the Wall’s challenges. His story underscores the dangers faced by those who seek to traverse the Wall and the complex relationships between wildlings and those who guard it.\",2\r\n997,WHITETREE,\"WHITETREE is an abandoned wildling village situated within the haunted forest, notable for its large, dominant weirwood tree. The location serves as a refuge for various characters in their journeys. Samwell Tarly and Gilly reach WHITETREE during their travels, seeking shelter in the desolate settlement. Later, Jon Snow and others investigate the village, drawn by its eerie atmosphere and the imposing presence of the ancient weirwood tree. The site’s abandonment and its connection to the wildlings add to its haunting reputation, making it a significant yet foreboding landmark in the haunted forest. The village’s isolation and the mysteries surrounding its past contribute to its role as a temporary haven for those traversing the dangerous wilderness.\",1\r\n998,EDDISON TOLLETT,\"Eddison Tollett, commonly known as Dolorous Edd, is a notable character in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series.

Additionally, he is known for providing information about Craster’s controversial and unsettling practices, highlighting his knowledge of the darker aspects of life in the far north. Despite his somber outlook, Edd is a loyal and reliable figure, contributing to the broader narrative through his observations and actions.

During a tense confrontation, Ser Patrek drew his sword against Wun Wun, an action that defied the sacred tradition of guest rights. Jon Snow had explicitly warned him about the consequences of violating this custom, but Ser Patrek disregarded the warning, leading to his fatal encounter. His defiance and subsequent death underscored the gravity of guest rights in the culture of the time and the peril of challenging a giant.

Additionally, he seeks to discuss a message concerning Jon's half-brother, indicating his involvement in broader familial and political matters.\n\nWhile the descriptions primarily associate the Lord Commander with the Night's Watch, there is a mention of the Lord Commander as the leader of the Kingsguard, involved in sending a knight to Cersei. However, this appears to be a separate context or a potential confusion, as the primary and consistent role of Jeor Mormont is as the leader of the Night's Watch.
