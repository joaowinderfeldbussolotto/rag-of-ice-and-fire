The kingdom is also renowned for its rich wine vintage and unique traditions. Dorne played a significant role in the political landscape of Westeros, including during the reign of Aerys II Targaryen, who sought to secure its loyalty by holding Elia Martell hostage.\n\nIn the broader narrative, Dorne is a key player in various political and military strategies. Tyrion Lannister suggests Dorne as a potential landing point for Aegon Targaryen, seeking its support for a rebellion.
