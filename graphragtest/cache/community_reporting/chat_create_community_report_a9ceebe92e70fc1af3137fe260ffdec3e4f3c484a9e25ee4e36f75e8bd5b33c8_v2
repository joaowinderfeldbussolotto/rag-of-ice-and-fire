As the younger brother of King Robert Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon, Renly bears a striking resemblance to Robert and is the uncle of Edric Storm. He is a nobleman who holds the Stormlands and is a key player in the power struggles following Robert’s death. Renly is depicted as a beloved but inexperienced military leader, often viewed as boyish due to his playful nature in childhood and his later political maneuvering. Despite his lack of experience, he garners significant support and is seen as a potential alternative heir to the Iron Throne, particularly if Joffrey Baratheon is deemed unfit to rule.\n\nRenly boldly claims the throne for himself, gathering armies at Storm’s End and negotiating alliances, including with House Tyrell, as he seeks to supplant Cersei Lannister by bringing Margaery Tyrell to court. His ambitions put him in direct conflict with his brother Stannis, who also claims the crown, leading to a bitter rivalry. Renly is known for his charm and political acumen, though some, like Catelyn Stark, consider allying with him against Lord Tywin Lannister. However, his death becomes a turning point in the conflict. He is killed by a shadow conjured by Melisandre, a death that is both mysterious and contentious, with figures like Randyll Tarly questioning its circumstances. His demise is a sensitive topic, haunting those who knew him, including Brienne of Tarth, who dreams of his death and its eerie transformation in her visions.\n\nRenly’s legacy is marked by his role on the small council, his plotting against Cersei, and his brief but impactful reign as a self-proclaimed king. His death leaves a void in the struggle for the throne, with his supporters, such as Loras Tyrell, grappling with its aftermath. Despite his flaws and the controversies surrounding his rule and death, Renly remains a significant figure whose actions shape the fate of Westeros.\",48\r\n961,STORM LORDS,\"The Storm Lords are the noble lords of the Stormlands, a prominent region in Westeros. They are known for their fierce loyalty and military prowess, often playing a crucial role in the political and martial affairs of the realm. During the War of the Five Kings, a significant faction of the Storm Lords declared their support for Renly Baratheon, raising their standards in his name and bolstering his claim to the Iron Throne. This allegiance highlighted their influence and willingness to engage in the broader conflicts of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nHowever, the Storm Lords are also noted for their dismissive attitude toward authority and counsel, particularly in their interactions with Stannis Baratheon. They are described as having laughed at the advice of Maester Cressen, a trusted advisor to Stannis, demonstrating a lack of respect for his guidance. Stannis himself cited their behavior as an example of the broader disdain his advisors faced, underscoring the Storm Lords' independent and sometimes rebellious nature.\n\nDespite their defiance, the Storm Lords remain a formidable and respected group within Westeros, known for their strength in battle and their unwavering commitment to their chosen causes. Their actions during the War of the Five Kings and their interactions with key figures like Renly and Stannis illustrate their complex role in the political landscape of the realm.\",2\r\n1140,SER COLEN OF GREENPOOLS,A knight who intercepts Catelyn and escorts her to Renly's camp,2\r\n1156,MARK MULLENDORE,\"Mark Mullendore is a knight known for his interactions within the noble circles of Westeros. He gained some notoriety when he was accused of having relations with Margaery Tyrell, though the specifics and validity of these accusations remain unclear. Despite this controversy, he is also recognized for his kindness, particularly toward Brienne of Tarth during her time at Highgarden, where he was one of the few knights who treated her with respect and courtesy.\n\nAdditionally, Mark Mullendore is noted for his eccentricities, such as keeping a pet monkey, which he was seen feeding during a feast. This detail adds a unique and somewhat whimsical aspect to his character, distinguishing him from other knights. His actions and demeanor suggest a complex personality—one that balances both controversy and compassion, as well as a touch of unconventional behavior.\",2\r\n784,NEW KINGSGUARD,A group formed by Renly as part of his claim to the throne,1\r\n1149,LORENT CASWELL,\"Lord Lorent Caswell is a host to Renly, providing a castle for his stay\",1\r\n1154,VARNER,Lord Varner is a lord mentioned in the context of the feast,1\r\n1155,GUYARD MORRIGEN,Ser Guyard Morrigen is a knight who sings a song at the feast,1\r\n1465,SER GUYARD MORRIGEN,\"Ser Guyard Morrigen is a knight who is slain in single combat, possibly by the ghost of Renly\",1\r\n327,KNIGHT OF FLOWERS,\"The Knight of Flowers, also known as Ser Loras Tyrell, is a prominent and skilled knight from House Tyrell. He is deeply involved in political and martial affairs, particularly in the ambitions of his family. A key figure in the plans to elevate his sister, Margaery Tyrell, to the position of queen, the Knight of Flowers demonstrates both strategic acumen and loyalty to his house.\n\nRenowned for his prowess in tournaments, he is celebrated as an exceptional jouster. One of his most notable achievements includes defeating the formidable Jaime Lannister in a previous tourney, solidifying his reputation as a masterful competitor. Additionally, he is known for unhorsing Littlefinger’s brother in another tournament, an event that is often mentioned in connection with a mysterious dagger, hinting at deeper intrigues surrounding his actions.\n\nThe Knight of Flowers embodies the chivalric ideals of knighthood while also navigating the complex political landscape of his time. His martial skills, combined with his family’s influence, make him a significant and respected figure in the realm.\",2\r\n59,HOUSE TYRELL,\"House Tyrell is a powerful and influential noble house from the Reach in Westeros, recognized by its golden rose sigil. The house plays a significant role in the political landscape of the realm, often aligning itself with key factions to advance its interests.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell’s presence is notably prominent in Renly Baratheon’s camp, where their golden rose sigil is displayed, signifying their support for Renly’s claim to the Iron Throne. However, Tyrion Lannister also suggests recruiting House Tyrell to bolster Joffrey Baratheon’s cause, indicating the house’s strategic importance and potential flexibility in alliances.\n\nAdditionally, House Tyrell is known for its ambition and political maneuvering, as evidenced by its interest in marrying Sansa Stark. This proposed union is driven by Sansa’s claim to Winterfell, which would further strengthen the Tyrells’ influence in the North and solidify their position in the realm.\n\nThere is also speculation that House Tyrell may have considered supporting Viserys Targaryen’s claim to the throne, though this remains uncertain. Their willingness to engage with multiple factions underscores their pragmatic approach to power and survival in the volatile political climate of Westeros.\n\nOverall, House Tyrell is a formidable and adaptable noble house, leveraging its wealth, military strength, and strategic marriages to maintain and expand its influence across the Seven Kingdoms.\",5\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n462,RENLY,STANNIS BARATHEON,\"Renly Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon are brothers who both served on the small council.

Renly, in contrast, is charismatic and well-liked, with a talent for diplomacy and a more approachable demeanor. Despite their shared lineage and service on the small council, the brothers become rival claimants to the Iron Throne following the death of their elder brother, King Robert Baratheon. Stannis asserts his claim based on primogeniture, while Renly, backed by the support of powerful allies, declares himself king, citing his ability to rule more effectively.
