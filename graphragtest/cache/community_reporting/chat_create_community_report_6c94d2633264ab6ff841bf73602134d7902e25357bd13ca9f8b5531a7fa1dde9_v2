Raised at Winterfell alongside his half-siblings, including Bran, Arya, and Robb, Jon is deeply connected to his family despite his status as a bastard. He is known for his direwolf, Ghost, and his skilled swordsmanship, which earns him the Valyrian steel sword Longclaw from Lord Commander Jeor Mormont.\n\nJon joins the Night’s Watch as a recruit at Castle Black, where he befriends Samwell Tarly, protecting him from bullying and advocating for his skills. He rises through the ranks, becoming the 998th Lord Commander, leading the defense of the Wall and making critical strategic decisions. His leadership is marked by his efforts to negotiate with wildlings, including Tormund, and his controversial decision to allow them passage through the Wall to save lives.\n\nJon’s journey is fraught with conflict and introspection. He struggles with his identity, loyalty, and the weight of his vows, particularly when he considers deserting to join Robb Stark’s war effort. However, he is ultimately convinced to remain by Mormont. His experiences beyond the Wall are pivotal, including his capture by the Thenns, his interactions with Ygritte, and his visions involving weirwood trees and direwolves. He also faces supernatural threats, such as wights, and engages in wolf dreams that hint at deeper mystical connections.\n\nJon plays a crucial role in the political and military affairs of the North, advising Stannis Baratheon and mediating conflicts. He is involved in key events, such as the defense of Castle Black, the rescue mission at Hardhome, and the discovery of dragonglass.

His story is one of resilience, duty, and the enduring bonds of family and brotherhood, as he seeks to protect the realm from the threats beyond the Wall.\",122\r\n2364,WUN WUN,\"WUN WUN is a giant who plays a notable role in the events involving Ser Patrek.

Despite his imposing size and strength, he is initially protected by the sacred tradition of guest rights, which grants him a measure of safety and respect under the laws of hospitality.\n\nHowever, WUN WUN's demeanor takes a violent turn when he attacks Ser Patrek in a sudden and aggressive outburst. This act of violence contrasts sharply with his earlier status as a guest, suggesting a breakdown in the protections afforded to him or a moment of uncontrollable rage. The reasons for his attack are not fully detailed, but it marks a significant shift in his behavior, highlighting the unpredictable and dangerous nature of giants, even those who can communicate with humans.\n\nWUN WUN's duality—both as a guest under protection and as a violent assailant—paints a complex picture of his character.

Dywen is particularly vocal about his experiences beyond the Wall, often making bold claims about the strange and unsettling things he has encountered there.\n\nAs a forester, Dywen expresses discomfort about the eerie occurrences in the haunted forest, particularly noting the lack of game and the unsettling presence of something lurking in the night. He is also known for his keen sense of smell, once remarking on the peculiar \"\"smell of cold\"\" in the air. His suspicions extend to Othor, whom he suggests carried an axe, hinting at deeper, darker events beyond the Wall.\n\nDywen is not one to shy away from criticism, openly disparaging Craster’s reputation and sharing his skepticism with others. Despite his gruff demeanor, he maintains a sense of humor, often joking about his past interactions with women. His role as a ranger also involves reporting critical information, such as the movements of the queen’s men, to Jon Snow and other leaders at Castle Black.\n\nA survivor of harrowing battles and a witness to the supernatural horrors beyond the Wall, Dywen’s experiences make him a valuable, if somewhat cynical, member of the Night’s Watch.

Thorne’s hostility toward Jon extends to scheming against him, aligning with figures like Janos Slynt in his efforts to undermine Jon’s authority.\n\nDespite his role as a military officer involved in training and conflicts, Thorne’s loyalty to the Night’s Watch is questionable. He is sent beyond the Wall as a ranger by Jon, believing the assignment is a death sentence, further fueling his resentment. Additionally, Thorne is involved in reporting supernatural threats, such as the dead coming alive, and seeks an audience with the king to convey these dangers. He is also dispatched to King’s Landing with Jafer Flowers’ hand, indicating his occasional involvement in broader political and military matters outside the Night’s Watch.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Ser Alliser Thorne remains a contentious figure, embodying the harsh realities of life in the Night’s Watch while clashing with those who challenge his authority or methods.
