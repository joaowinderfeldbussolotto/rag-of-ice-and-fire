The house is prominently associated with key figures such as Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure Tully, who play significant roles in the political and military affairs of Westeros. House Tully's banners are flown at Riverrun, symbolizing their authority and influence in the region.\n\nThe Tullys have strong ties to House Stark through marriage, particularly with Catelyn Stark (née Tully), who is the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, the former head of the house. This alliance has drawn House Tully into major conflicts, including the War of the Five Kings, where they have been involved in political discussions and military engagements. Their forces, however, have faced setbacks, notably suffering defeat at the hands of Jaime Lannister.\n\nHouse Tully commands the loyalty of several bannermen, including House Frey, whose allegiance is sworn to them, though this relationship has been fraught with tension. The Freys, led by Lord Walder Frey, are among the most powerful vassals of House Tully, though their loyalty has been tested by the events of war and shifting political alliances.\n\nRiverrun, the formidable stronghold of House Tully, has been a focal point of defense and conflict, with the family striving to protect their lands and people. The house has also been petitioned by their bannermen regarding raids on their territories, highlighting their role as protectors of the Riverlands. Despite challenges, House Tully remains a resilient and influential noble house, deeply entwined in the power struggles of Westeros.\",14\r\n24,HOUSE STARK,\"House Stark is a noble family from the North of Westeros, renowned for their honor, leadership, and deep connection to the old gods. They rule from their ancestral seat, Winterfell, and their sigil is a direwolf, symbolizing their strength and resilience. The house is led by Eddard \"\"Ned\"\" Stark, who plays a pivotal role in the political and military conflicts of Westeros, particularly in opposing House Lannister during the war.\n\nHouse Stark is the noble family of several prominent members, including Arya, Sansa, Robb, Bran, and Rickon Stark, all of whom are central figures in the region's affairs. Arya Stark, a notable member, underscores the family's highborn status, while Catelyn Stark, originally of House Tully, becomes part of House Stark through marriage, further entangling the family in the war and political intrigues of the realm.\n\nThe house is also referenced in the context of the Red Wedding, a pivotal and tragic event in their history. Additionally, House Stark has historical alliances, such as with House Bracken, which have led to conflicts with the crown. They are known for providing guards and support in critical missions, reinforcing their role as a key power in the North.\n\nHouse Stark's legacy is marked by their unwavering commitment to justice, their leadership in the North, and their involvement in the broader struggles of Westeros. Their story is one of resilience, tragedy, and enduring influence in the realm.\",17\r\n77,HOUSE LANNISTER,\"House Lannister is one of the most powerful and wealthy noble houses in Westeros, ruling over the Westerlands and wielding significant influence in King’s Landing. Known for their crimson colors, the house is led by Lord Tywin Lannister and includes prominent members such as Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion, Joffrey, Tyrek, and Lancel Lannister. The family is deeply entrenched in political intrigue, warfare, and the governance of the Seven Kingdoms, particularly after the death of Robert Baratheon.\n\nHouse Lannister is widely feared and resented, especially by the people of King’s Landing, due to their ruthless tactics and perceived tyranny. They are accused of various atrocities, including raiding and destruction in the Riverlands, as well as the suspected involvement in the death of Ser Hugh. The house is also a central figure in the conflicts of the realm, gathering armies at Casterly Rock and commanding vast forces in the ongoing wars.\n\nThe Lannisters are notorious for their cunning, ambition, and wealth, which have secured their dominance in Westeros. Their alliances, such as the one brokered with Highgarden through Littlefinger, further solidify their power. However, they face significant opposition, particularly from Stannis Baratheon, who accuses them of incest and illegitimacy, labeling them his true enemies. The house is also not favorably disposed toward the Night’s Watch and harbors deep grudges against other noble families, including the Westerlings and the Starks.\n\nDespite their strength, internal tensions exist, particularly regarding Tyrion Lannister, who fears prejudice from his own family. The Lannisters’ legacy is steeped in history and myth, with tales of their ancestor, Lann the Clever, adding to their storied reputation. Their actions and influence shape the political and personal conflicts of the realm, making them a formidable and often reviled force in Westeros.\",21\r\n620,WAR,\"War is a significant and ongoing conflict that serves as a central topic of discussion among the lords at Winterfell.
