The eldest son of Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister, though publicly claimed as the heir of Robert Baratheon, Joffrey is infamous for his cruelty, arrogance, and volatile temper. His legitimacy as king is frequently questioned, particularly by Stannis Baratheon, who declares him a bastard born of incest.\n\nJoffrey ascends to the throne after Robert Baratheon's death, becoming the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. His reign is marked by tyranny, poor leadership, and a penchant for harsh punishments, including the execution of Eddard Stark, which sparks political turmoil. He is deeply feared by Sansa Stark, his betrothed and later wife, whom he torments and abuses, demanding gifts and threatening her family. Despite moments of courteous behavior, such as sitting with Sansa at feasts, his cruelty overshadows any semblance of kindness.\n\nJoffrey’s actions lead to widespread suffering and conflict. He is involved in the death of Sansa’s father, Eddard Stark, and is responsible for ordering his execution despite protests. His marriage to Sansa is a political maneuver, though he also shows interest in other cruel acts, such as mocking others and insisting on harsh punishments for his enemies. His wedding feast, celebrated in King’s Landing, ends in his poisoning, orchestrated by the Queen of Thorns and Tyrion Lannister, marking the end of his reign.\n\nJoffrey’s relationship with his family is complex. He is corrupted by his mother, Cersei, and often pushes away his uncle, Jaime Lannister, boasting about his strength. His younger brother, Tommen, is mentioned as being influenced by his memory. Joffrey’s Kingsguard and the City Watch serve him, though his rule is also managed by figures like Tyrion Lannister, who attempts to control his destructive tendencies.\n\nHis death is a pivotal moment, referenced by characters like Davos and Arya Stark, who includes him on her list of those she wishes dead. Joffrey’s legacy is one of cruelty and instability, leaving a lasting impact on the realm and those who suffered under his rule. Despite his youth and handsome appearance, his actions cement his reputation as one of the most despised rulers in the history of the Seven Kingdoms.\",51\r\n1550,QUEEN OF THORNS,\"The Queen of Thorns is a nickname for Lady Olenna Tyrell, a sharp-tongued and influential noblewoman from House Tyrell. Known for her wit, cunning, and political acumen, she wields significant power within the realm, often shaping decisions and strategies from behind the scenes. Lady Olenna is implicated in the poisoning of King Joffrey Baratheon, demonstrating her willingness to take bold and decisive actions to protect her family’s interests and eliminate threats.\n\nAs a powerful and cunning figure, she orchestrates plans with precision, including a scheme to marry Sansa Stark to her grandson, Willas Tyrell, likely to strengthen her family’s alliances and influence. Her sharp intellect and manipulative prowess are evident in her ability to sway even her son, Mace Tyrell, the head of House Tyrell, suggesting that many of his decisions are influenced by her counsel. Despite her advanced age, Lady Olenna remains a formidable force in the political landscape of Westeros, respected and feared for her keen mind and unyielding determination. Her legacy as the Queen of Thorns is marked by both her verbal barbs and her strategic brilliance, making her one of the most memorable figures in the realm.\",5\r\n1099,TYREK LANNISTER,\"Tyrek Lannister is a young nobleman and a member of the prominent Lannister family.

At her command, he is ordered to locate and capture Varys, the Master of Whisperers, reflecting his role as an enforcer of the crown’s will. His actions underscore his allegiance to the Lannisters and his willingness to execute their directives, regardless of their moral implications.\n\nSer Meryyn’s presence in the Kingsguard highlights the corruption and brutality of the regime he serves, as he plays an active role in upholding its oppressive rule.
