The region is also of strategic interest to Euron Greyjoy, who believes the Iron Fleet could reach its shores.\n\nSlaver's Bay is notorious for its historical reliance on slavery, though recent conflicts and the abolition of the slave trade have destabilized the area, making travel perilous. The region is a hotspot for war and upheaval, with shifting power dynamics and ongoing struggles for control. Among the notable figures operating in the area is Khal Pono, a warlord known for driving slaves, further illustrating the region's turbulent and brutal nature.\n\nThe convergence of these elements—military campaigns, political intrigue, and the remnants of the slave trade—makes Slaver's Bay a critical and dangerous location in the broader narrative.
