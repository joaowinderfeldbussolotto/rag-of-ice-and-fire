The city was conquered by Daenerys Targaryen and her followers after she negotiated the purchase of the Unsullied, only to later free them and overthrow the ruling slavers. This act of liberation marked a significant turning point in Daenerys' campaign against slavery in the region.\n\nFollowing its fall, Astapor became a site of ongoing conflict and instability. The city was ruled by Cleon, a former slave who rose to power after Daenerys' departure, and sought alliances with Meereen against Yunkai, another rival city in Slaver's Bay. However, Astapor's struggles continued, culminating in its eventual downfall, with the city burning and its refugees fleeing to Meereen for safety.\n\nAstapor's history is deeply intertwined with Daenerys' actions, as it was here that she first demonstrated her resolve to dismantle the slave trade, despite initially viewing the Unsullied as a useful military asset. The city also became a strategic point of contention among the cities of Slaver's Bay, with Yunkai and Meereen playing key roles in its fate. Additionally, Astapor is noted as a location where the Windblown, a mercenary company, are currently stationed, further complicating the region's volatile political landscape.\n\nIn summary, Astapor is a city defined by its past as a slave-trading hub, its liberation by Daenerys, and its subsequent struggles under new leadership, ultimately leading to its destruction and the displacement of its people.\",9\r\n2277,BLOODY FLUX,\"**Summary of the Bloody Flux**\n\nThe Bloody Flux is a severe and contagious disease that has significantly impacted various groups and individuals in the regions of Meereen and Astapor. It is notably associated with the survivors of Astapor, particularly the Astapori, who are known to carry and spread the illness. The disease has affected both the Meereenese and Yunkish forces, as well as characters within the Yunkish camp, indicating its widespread and devastating reach.\n\nAmong those afflicted by the Bloody Flux are Nurse and Yezzan, highlighting that the disease does not discriminate between military personnel and civilians. Additionally, there is speculation that Penny, another character in the narrative, may have contracted the illness, further emphasizing its pervasive nature.\n\nThe Bloody Flux appears to thrive in the harsh conditions of the region, spreading rapidly among the vulnerable populations, including soldiers and survivors. Its presence has likely contributed to the weakening of both the Meereenese and Yunkish forces, exacerbating the already tense and conflict-ridden environment. The disease’s impact on key figures and groups underscores its role as a significant factor in the unfolding events in and around Meereen and Astapor.\",3\r\n2234,LORD GHAEL,Envoy from Astapor pleading for Daenerys' help,2\r\n2296,THE FALL OF ASTAPOR,The collapse of Astapor due to siege and disease,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3212,ASTAPOR,UNSULLIED,The Unsullied help Daenerys conquer Astapor,17\r\n4443,ASTAPOR,BLOODY FLUX,Astapor's survivors are affected by the bloody flux,12\r\n4317,LORD GHAEL,ASTAPOR,Lord Ghael is an envoy from Astapor,11\r\n4444,ASTAPOR,THE FALL OF ASTAPOR,\"Astapor has fallen and is burning, leading to refugees fleeing\",10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
