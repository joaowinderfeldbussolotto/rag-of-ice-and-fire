In a tragic turn, Tyrion finds her in Tywin’s bed, leading to her death at his hands, though some accounts suggest she was killed on Cersei’s orders. Additionally, Shae accuses Tyrion and Sansa of murder, claiming abuse, which further complicates her role in the narrative.\n\nShae’s origins are humble; she is initially a whore hired by Bronn for Tyrion, but she evolves into a more significant figure in his life.

In this new role, he serves as a companion to Brienne, continuing to demonstrate his loyalty and dedication.\n\nThroughout his service, Podrick is characterized by his quiet demeanor and unwavering commitment to those he serves, whether it be Tyrion or Brienne.
