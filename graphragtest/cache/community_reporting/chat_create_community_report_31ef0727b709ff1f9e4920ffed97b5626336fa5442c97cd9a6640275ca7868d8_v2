Serving as a loyal bannerman to House Lannister under Lord Tywin, he is a key figure in their military campaigns, often commanding the vanguard in battle. His reputation as a ruthless warrior is well-earned, marked by his involvement in numerous conflicts, including the Sack of King’s Landing, where he murdered a child, and the killing of Elia Martell, which fueled the Martells' desire for vengeance. Oberyn Martell sought to kill him for justice, and he became a target of Beric Dondarrion’s mission, rumored to have been killed by Beric twice, though he survived.\n\nGregor is associated with Harrenhal, having taken control of the castle and contributing to its dark history. He is also known for leading a group of 300 men to set fire to the riverlands, further cementing his role as a destructive force. His actions include capturing Gendry and Arya Stark, and his men were feared by Arya when they were near an inn. He is accused of raiding and destruction, earning the moniker \"\"The Enormity that Rides.\"\"\n\nDespite his formidable presence, Gregor suffered severe injuries, including wounds from the battle at the Red Fork and later experimentation by Qyburn, which left him in a dying state. He was also involved in conflicts with Bolton’s forces at the Trident and was tasked with setting fire to strategic locations. As Cersei Lannister’s champion, he participated in Tyrion’s trial by combat, reinforcing his role as a feared and loyal enforcer for the Lannisters.\n\nGregor’s legacy is one of brutality, torture, and fear, making him one of the most dreaded warriors in Westeros. His eventual fate, including his death and reanimation as Ser Robert Strong, underscores his enduring impact on the realm’s history.\",31\r\n1221,POLLIVER,\"Polliver is a character in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series, notably encountered by Sandor Clegane (the Hound) and Arya Stark.

During his time with the Lannister forces, Polliver is seen wearing Gendry’s helmet, which he likely took as spoils of war. He is also known for taking Arya Stark’s sword, Needle, and wearing it at his hip, an act that deeply angers Arya. This theft of Needle places Polliver on Arya’s list of people she wants dead, marking him as a target for her vengeance. Later, Polliver is depicted as carrying Needle before Arya ultimately recovers it, reinforcing his role as a significant antagonist in her journey.
