As the eldest son of Walder Frey, he played a key role in the political and military affairs of the house, serving as a bannerman and representing his family in important negotiations. Notably, he led the initial discussions with Robb Stark, demonstrating his leadership and diplomatic responsibilities within the family.\n\nStevron Frey was also the half-brother of Merrett Frey, further solidifying his position within the complex familial structure of House Frey. His lineage extended to include a grandson, Petyr Pimple, who was later captured, adding to the family's turbulent history.\n\nDespite his significant role, Stevron Frey's life came to an end, as he is described as a deceased individual in the text. His death prompted discussions about the succession of House Frey, as he had been the designated heir. His passing marked a turning point for the family, leading to uncertainty and debate over who would inherit his position and responsibilities. Stevron Frey's legacy, therefore, is one of leadership, familial ties, and the inevitable challenges of succession within a powerful noble house.\",4\r\n303,WALDER FREY,\"Lord Walder Frey is the head of House Frey and the Lord of the Crossing, ruling from the Twins. A cunning and politically astute nobleman, he is known for his intricate maneuvering and strategic alliances, often waiting until the outcome of conflicts is clear before committing his forces. As a father to numerous children, including Stevron Frey and Elmar Frey, and grandfather to the Walders, he has used his family as tools in his political schemes, including offering his daughters as potential brides to secure alliances, such as with Ser Brynden.\n\nWalder Frey’s reputation is marred by distrust due to his past disloyalty, most notably his broken alliance with Robb Stark. This betrayal stemmed from Robb’s marriage to Jeyne Westerling, which nullified a prior agreement to wed one of Frey’s daughters. His late arrival at the Battle of the Trident further cemented his reputation for opportunism. Despite this, he remained a key player in the political landscape, negotiating with both Robb Stark and Catelyn Stark for the passage of Robb’s army across the Green Fork, amassing 4,000 men in the process.\n\nFrey’s most infamous act was orchestrating the Red Wedding, a massacre that resulted in the deaths of Robb Stark and many of his bannermen, solidifying his role in the downfall of House Stark. His involvement in political intrigue extended to the death of a king, further demonstrating his ruthless ambition. Additionally, he was considered a potential recipient of Harrenhal, highlighting his influence and the rewards he sought for his actions.\n\nAs the Lord of the Twins, Walder Frey’s legacy is one of calculated betrayal and political pragmatism, making him one of the most feared and distrusted figures in the realm. His actions, particularly the Red Wedding, have left an indelible mark on the history of the Seven Kingdoms.\",20\r\n605,THE TWINS,\"The Twins is a strategic and significant location in the story, serving as the seat of House Frey and a key crossing point over the Green Fork. The fortress consists of two castles connected by a wide bridge, firmly controlled by House Frey. It plays a central role in the political and military conflicts of the narrative, particularly involving House Stark and their allies.\n\nCatelyn Stark negotiates with Lord Walder Frey at The Twins to secure safe passage for Robb Stark’s army across the Green Fork, highlighting its importance as a strategic crossing. The location is also where Robb Stark and his forces cross, reinforcing its military significance. Additionally, The Twins is a destination for Catelyn and Robb as they travel, and it becomes the site of a fateful wedding where Robb Stark and many of his bannermen are betrayed and killed in a massacre orchestrated by the Freys, an event known as the Red Wedding.\n\nThe Twins is deeply associated with House Frey’s power and influence, serving as the residence of Lord Walder Frey and his family. It is where Emmon Frey’s marriage to Genna Lannister is referenced, and where Lord Walder’s daughters are to be met. The location is also a place of captivity, holding hostages such as Marq Piper and other prisoners, including those taken by the Freys after Robb Stark’s betrayal.\n\nThe Hound, Sandor Clegane, plans to ransom Arya Stark to Robb at The Twins but ultimately prevents her from entering, recognizing the danger posed by the Freys. The Twins is also near where the war has spread, and its control by House Frey blocks retreat for opposing forces, making it a critical stronghold.\n\nThe Walders, prominent members of House Frey, hail from The Twins, further emphasizing its importance in the story. The location is frequently mentioned as a gathering place for Frey men, as noted by Ramsay Bolton, and serves as a base for Lord Walder Frey’s forces. After Robb Stark’s death, figures like Ryman Frey and Black Walder return to The Twins, solidifying its role as the heart of House Frey’s power.\n\nIn summary, The Twins is a pivotal location—both militarily and politically—where key events unfold, alliances are forged and broken, and where the Freys exert their dominance over the region. Its dual-castle structure and control over the Green Fork make it indispensable in the broader conflict.\",11\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1466,STEVRON FREY,WALDER FREY,Stevron Frey is the heir of Walder Frey,24\r\n492,WALDER FREY,BATTLE OF THE TRIDENT,\"Walder Frey arrived late to the Battle of the Trident, an action that raised significant doubts about his loyalty and was widely perceived as a display of disloyalty.
