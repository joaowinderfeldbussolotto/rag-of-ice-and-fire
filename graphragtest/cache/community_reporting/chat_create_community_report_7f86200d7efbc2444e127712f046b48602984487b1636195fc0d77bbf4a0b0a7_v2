Known for his ornate maester’s chain and his subservience to the Lannisters, Pycelle is deeply involved in the political intrigue of the court, though his loyalty is frequently questioned.\n\nPycelle is present during key moments in the kingdom’s history, including Robert Baratheon’s final moments, where he attends to the dying king. He also conveys the news of Robert’s death, further cementing his role as a central figure in the court. Additionally, he discusses Jon Arryn’s death with Ned Stark and tends to Ned’s injuries, demonstrating his medical expertise.\n\nDespite his wisdom and experience, Pycelle is not without controversy. Cersei Lannister blames him for her predicaments, and he is later taken into custody by Tyrion Lannister, during which he confesses to certain crimes. His political savvy and love for his office sometimes lead him to act in ways that serve his own interests or those of the Lannisters.\n\nPycelle is also known for his scholarly contributions, such as explaining the term \"\"Light of the Lord\"\" and advising Barristan Selmy on aging and sleep. His knowledge extends to obscure topics, including mentions of the Faceless Men, showcasing his broad understanding of both history and lore.\n\nOverall, Grand Maester Pycelle is a complex figure—wise, politically astute, and deeply entrenched in the power dynamics of the royal court, yet often viewed with suspicion due to his allegiances and actions.\",11\r\n372,FACELESS MEN,\"The Faceless Men are a secretive and enigmatic society of assassins based in Braavos, renowned for their lethal skills and mysterious operations.
