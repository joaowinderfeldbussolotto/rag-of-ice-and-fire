Initially, they were a mercenary company that Tyrion Lannister joined after fleeing Westeros. Under the leadership of Brown Ben Plumm, the Second Sons were later deployed to guard Meereen under the command of Daenerys Targaryen. However, their loyalty proved fickle, as they were known to accept gifts, such as wine, from Daenerys, only to be found too drunk to fight when needed. At one point, the company defected to Yunkai, abandoning their post in Meereen.\n\nDespite their shifting allegiances, the Second Sons remained a key player in the region’s conflicts. Tyrion Lannister, along with Jorah Mormont, joined the company, with Tyrion strategizing to influence them to switch sides once more. Additionally, there were indications that another mercenary group, the Windblown, might defect to the Second Sons, further complicating the political and military landscape of Meereen.\n\nThroughout their history, the Second Sons exemplified the unpredictable nature of sellsword companies, driven by profit and opportunism rather than steadfast loyalty.

His devotion to her is further evidenced when he returns to her side, reinforcing his commitment despite his earlier disagreements. In a bold move, he asks Daenerys to marry him, underscoring his deep affection and desire to bind himself to her cause permanently.\n\nThroughout his journey, Daario Naharis embodies the complexities of a warrior torn between loyalty and personal ambition, making him a compelling and multifaceted character in Daenerys Targaryen's story.
