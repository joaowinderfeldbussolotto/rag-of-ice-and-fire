This act of violence stems from Cersei’s deep-seated hatred for Tyrion and her desire to punish those associated with him. Despite Cersei’s earlier promise to protect those under her care, Tyrion later questions whether she would honor such a vow, given her cruel treatment of Alayaya. The incident highlights the dangerous and unpredictable nature of the Lannister family dynamics, particularly Cersei’s vindictiveness.\n\nAlayaya’s character is primarily mentioned in the context of her connections to Tyrion and Cersei, serving as a tragic figure caught in the crossfire of their conflict.
