It is renowned for its grandeur and importance within the Faith of the Seven, the dominant religion in the realm. The sept has been the setting for numerous pivotal events, including royal weddings, such as the marriage of King Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell. However, it has also been a place of imprisonment, as Margaery Tyrell was once held captive within its walls.\n\nThe Great Sept of Baelor holds historical and political significance, marked by moments of both celebration and turmoil. The bells of the sept tolled to mourn the death of King Robert Baratheon, underscoring its role in the kingdom's rituals and traditions. Additionally, the sept became a focal point of tension when Stannis Baratheon threatened to burn it, reflecting the religious and political conflicts of the time.\n\nThe sept is also notable for its association with Cersei Lannister, who began her infamous walk of atonement from its steps, a humiliating public penance that further cemented the building's place in the realm's turbulent history. Furthermore, the discovery of a cache of wildfire jars beneath the sept highlights its strategic importance and the dangers lurking within its sacred walls.\n\nOverall, the Great Sept of Baelor stands as a symbol of faith, power, and the intertwined nature of religion and politics in King's Landing, witnessing both the solemn and the dramatic events that shape the realm.\",5\r\n271,HIGH SEPTON,\"The High Septon is a prominent religious leader in the Faith of the Seven, the dominant religion in Westeros, wielding significant political and spiritual influence in King’s Landing. As the head of the Faith, he oversees major religious and judicial proceedings, including the trials of Cersei Lannister and Margaery Tyrell, as well as the imprisonment of Cersei. He is also noted for presiding over the trial of Eddard Stark, where he advocated for mercy, and for offering to absolve Aemon from his vows.\n\nThe High Septon’s role is marked by both reverence and controversy. While he is a high-ranking figure present at key events, such as those in Baelor’s Sept, he is also criticized for corruption and decadence, particularly by figures like Stannis Baratheon, who challenges his teachings on justice and goodness. His authority is further complicated by political maneuvering, as one iteration of the High Septon is appointed by Tyrion Lannister, reflecting the intertwining of religion and power in Westeros.\n\nThe High Septon’s death is a pivotal moment, as it leads to Lancel Lannister’s fasting in penance. His demise occurs during a riot, marking a turning point in the religious and political landscape of King’s Landing. Following his death, a new High Septon emerges, formerly a member of the Sparrows, a radical faction within the Faith, signaling a shift in the Faith’s direction.\n\nThe High Septon’s legacy is one of both spiritual leadership and political intrigue, embodying the complex relationship between religion and governance in Westeros. His role is so influential that it is even speculated as a potential future position for Bran Stark, underscoring the enduring significance of the office.\",12\r\n701,TOMEN,\"Tommen Baratheon, commonly referred to as King Tommen, is the young king of the Seven Kingdoms and the son of Cersei Lannister. He ascended to the throne following the death of his elder brother, King Joffrey Baratheon. As a young and impressionable ruler, Tommen is often depicted as a boy whose safety and well-being are of great concern to his mother, Cersei, who threatens harm to others if they act against her interests, including using Tommen as leverage.\n\nTommen is a prince who was once under the protection of Boros Blount, though this guardianship proved inadequate. Before his reign, he was a young boy considered as a potential token of good faith in negotiations with Dorne, highlighting his political significance even before becoming king. His rule is marked by his youthful inexperience, as seen when he signs warrants and writs, including one for Brienne of Tarth, under the influence of those around him, particularly his mother and later his wife, Margaery Tyrell. Margaery is noted for her influence over him, including her plans for Maiden's Day, which Tommen mentions.\n\nTommen is also the young king to whom Jon Snow plans to send a letter, indicating his role as a central figure in the political landscape of Westeros. Before his injury, Bran Stark once defeated him in training, showcasing Tommen's limited martial abilities. Despite his youth, Tommen's reign is fraught with the challenges of ruling a fractured kingdom, and his health is occasionally a concern, as he is described as having a cold at one point. His position as king is both a symbol of Lannister power and a vulnerable point in the dynasty's hold over the realm.\",5\r\n1116,MOON BOY,\"Moon Boy is a jester known for his mockery of the High Septon, often employing sharp wit and satire in his performances. Despite his role as an entertainer, he is widely regarded as a fool, with some believing he may be working for Varys, the Master of Whisperers. His actions and allegiances remain ambiguous, as his humorous demeanor contrasts with the suspicions surrounding his potential involvement in political intrigue. Whether genuinely aligned with Varys or simply a figure of ridicule, Moon Boy’s presence adds a layer of complexity to the court’s dynamics, blending comedy with underlying tensions.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4767,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR,CERSEI,Cersei begins her walk of atonement at the Great Sept of Baelor,138\r\n1338,HIGH SEPTON,JOFFREY,The High Septon presides over Eddard Stark's trial and asks Joffrey for his verdict,63\r\n3694,TOMEN,LORAS TYRELL,Loras Tyrell supervises the guards protecting Tommen,25\r\n2196,HIGH SEPTON,MOON BOY,Moon Boy mocks the High Septon,13\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
