It is governed by Lady Hornwood, who plays a key role in the political and marital negotiations of the region. The area is notable for its dense forest, which bears the same name and serves as a strategic location in the conflicts between powerful houses.\n\nThe forest of Hornwood has become a contested battleground, particularly between House Manderly and House Bolton, as they vie for control and influence in the North. This struggle is further complicated by the actions of Ramsay Snow, a notorious figure linked to House Bolton, whose ruthless tactics have left a mark on the region. His involvement in Hornwood has added to the instability and tension, particularly in relation to Lady Hornwood and her holdings.\n\nHornwood’s significance extends beyond its natural resources, as it is a focal point for power struggles and alliances.

The forced union ultimately led to her untimely death, as she was murdered by Ramsay Snow, with some accounts also implicating Reek in her killing. Her murder is a significant event, referenced in the broader narrative as an example of Ramsay’s brutality and the perilous position of noblewomen in a world dominated by power struggles.\n\nLady Hornwood’s fate underscores the vulnerabilities faced by women in noble houses, particularly when caught in the machinations of more ruthless figures.

This act, among others, solidifies his reputation as a merciless and power-hungry individual. Despite his violent tendencies, he has also been known to offer gold in exchange for wolfskins and information on the walking dead, suggesting a strategic and opportunistic mindset.\n\nHis dual nature—both a rescuer and a tyrant—makes him a formidable and unpredictable presence in the region.
