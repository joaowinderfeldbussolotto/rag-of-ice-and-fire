If Tyrion had her guarded by his \nclansmen\n, it would only be a matter of time before everyone\nknew of his concubine.\nHe enters the room not intending to disturb Shae, but the sight of her nude body makes him hard. He spreads her\nlegs and starts to lick her until his beard is soaked and then enters her, and explodes almost at once. She opens her\neyes and tells him she just had the sweetest dream.\nTyrion thinks of the wars and intrigues and that he was made for this.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VI\n↑\nBran IV\n ←\nTyrion VII\n→ \nArya VII\n↓\nTyrion VIII\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 30: Arya VII\nPlace(s): \nHarrenhal\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya VI\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nArya VII\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nArya VIII\nArya\n is working for the understeward of the \nWailing Tower\n doing various chores. When the Ser \nAmory Lorch\narrives, \nJaqen H'ghar\n, \nRorge\n and \nBiter\n are with him. Arya thinks that Jaqen has not seen her, but he interrupts her\nsleep that night to tell her he will kill three men for her for saving him and his two companions. She avoids Jaqen for\na while, but after hearing a story by \nChiswyck\n, she whispers Chiswyck’s name in Jaqen's ear. Several days later he\nfalls to his death.\nSynopsis\nArya\n wonders what King \nHarren Hoare\n meant to name the five towers of \nHarrenhal\n, but they are now known as the\nTower of Dread\n, the \nWidow's Tower\n, the \nWailing Tower\n, the \nTower of Ghosts\n, and \nKingspyre Tower\n since the\nburning of Harrenhal\n. She now sleeps in a niche in the vaults beneath the Wailing Tower. The work is hard, but no\nharder than the miles she was walking every day, and she can wash and the food is filling; she does not need to find\nbugs to eat. \nHot Pie\n is assigned to the kitchens, and \nGendry\n to the forge, while Arya works for the understeward\nWeese\n doing errands; running messages, drawing water, fetching food, and sometimes serving tables in the barracks\nhall. Arya hates \nWeese\n and adds him to her list of names. She occasionally gets to see Hot Pie when she is sent to\nfetch the food for Weese and his charges; Arya does not want to learn the names of Weese’s other charges since it\nhurts when people she knows die.\nLady \nShella Whent\n only occupied parts of two towers, letting the rest of the castle go to ruin. She left a small staff\nwhen she fled, inadequate for the host that now occupies the castle. As a result, the \nLannisters\n have to forage for\nservants to make more of Harrenhal habitable. Harrenhal covers three times the area of \nWinterfell\n, but its buildings\nare much grander: the stables handle 1000 horses, the \nGodswood\n covers 20 acres, the kitchen is as large as\nWinterfell’s Great Hall, and the Hall of the Hundred Hearths could handle Tywin’s entire host.\nSome claim the ghosts of \nHarren the Black\n and his sons occupy the Wailing Tower, but Arya knows that they died\nin the Kingspyre Tower; the wailing is from the wind, and the ghosts never trouble her. However she fears living\nmen, including Ser \nGregor Clegane\n and \nTywin Lannister\n, who keep their apartments in the Kingspyre Tower. She\nconsiders marching up to Tywin and telling him who she is, but figures she would never get close enough to him,\nand if she did, he would not believe her, and she would get a beating form Weese, whom she fears more than the\nMountain; he hits at the slightest provocation. On the road to Harrenhal, she felt like a sheep, but now she feels like\na mouse.\nThe lords and ladies never notice the grey mice under their feet, and Arya hears many secrets by just listening as she\ndoes her duties. The 'slut' Pretty \nPia\n is working her way through every knight, the wife of the gaoler is pregnant\neither by Ser \nAlyn Stackspear\n or a singer \nWhitesmile\n, Lord \nLeo Lefford\n keeps a candle lit by his bed because of the\nghosts, Ser \nDunaver\n’s squire \nJodge\n cannot hold his water at night, the cooks spit on the despised Ser \nHarys Swyft\n’s\nfood, and Maester \nTothmure\n’s serving girl told her brother that Tywin has ordered the maester to burn a message\nclaiming that Joffrey is a bastard, and to never speak of it again. She also hears from Weese that \nStannis Baratheon\nand \nRenly Baratheon\n are both kings and have joined the fighting. Many of the Lannister men question how long\nJoffrey can hold the throne, protected only by \nGold Cloaks\n and ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf and a woman.
