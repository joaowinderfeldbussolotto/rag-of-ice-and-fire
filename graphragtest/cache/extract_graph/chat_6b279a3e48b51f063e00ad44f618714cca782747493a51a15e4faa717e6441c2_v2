No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor.\nAnd small good it did either of them.”\nCressen then proposes a marriage pact between Shireen and young \nRobert Arryn\n. Stannis dismisses the possibility of\nbringing the weak and sickly Robert to Dragonstone, as planned before Lord Arryn’s death, because \nLysa Arryn\n is\nparanoid and hides him in the \nEyrie\n. Cressen urges him to send Shireen and her fool to the Eyrie instead—\nDragonstone is a grim home for a child. Stannis now agrees that it is worth a try.\nThen Stannis’ wife, Queen \nSelyse\n, arrives to argue that Stannis should not have to beg or bargain for help; they all\nowe their allegiance to him as the true king. Queen Selyse has been entirely converted to the worship of the foreign\ngod \nR'hllor\n by the red priestess \nMelisandre\n of \nAsshai\n. Stannis tells her he needs swords, and asks whether she has an\narmy. She replies that \nHouse Florent\n can provide an army, but Stannis retorts that they can only provide 2,000 men,\nand are too close to \nHighgarden\n. The queen proclaims that the \ncomet\n is an omen from the Lord of Light that He will\naid Stannis in his conquest. Stannis, who does not share his wife’s newfound faith, questions how many men the\nRed God will deliver him. Selyse insists that R’hllor will provide all the power of \nHighgarden\n and \nStorm's End\n.\nStannis reminds her that those men now support Renly. Selyse agrees, but suggests that if Renly should die, his\narmy would join Stannis. She then notes that Melisandre has looked into the flames and seen Renly dead. Cressen is\nhorrified by the notion and pleads that fratricide is evil. Stannis declares that he has heard Cressen’s advice and will\nnow hear hers, and sends the aged maester away.\nBy the time Cressen joins Pylos at the bottom of the steps, he can hardly stand erect, and needs to be helped back to\nhis rooms. There, Cressen contemplates his options. He raised Robert, Stannis, and Renly after their father died, and\ncannot watch one kill the other. He knows that everything Queen Selyse said has been preached to her by\nMelisandre, the red priestess. It is she who must be silenced before she can convert King Stannis to her evil schemes\nand spread her mad religion beyond Dragonstone.\nTherefore, Cressen goes to a small workroom under the rookery stair and retrieves a small vial of purple crystals, a\npoison known in Westeros only as \nthe Strangler\n. Dissolved in wine, one of the small crystals is enough to cause the\nvictim's throat muscles to constrict more tightly than any fist, making it impossible for the victim to breathe. Cressen\nplans to put one in Lady Melisandre’s drink at the feast Stannis is holding for his bannermen tonight. He knows it is\na dreadful thing he is planning, but surely the gods will forgive him. As he lays down for a nap, Cressen wonders if\nthe comet is his, foreboding murder.\nHours later, Cressen wakes to discover he has overslept and is late for the feast. He calls for Pylos, who should have\nawoken him, but Pylos does not come, so he has to shout for the servants. As he crosses the long gallery, the comet\noutside the windows looks malevolent to him, but he thinks he should not fear. When he enters the great hall, he\nfinds Stannis and his bannermen have begun without him. As Cressen crosses the room, Patchface the fool lurches\ninto him while singing the same song from the morning and they both fall to the floor. Face-to-face with Cressen,\nthe fool says “Under the sea you fall up, I know, I know.”\nCressen is too feeble to rise on his own, but fortunately strong hands lift him to his feet. When he turns to thank the\nknight he believes helped him, he comes face-to-face with Lady Melisandre herself, clothed in red silk with red\neyes. The red priestess mockingly advises him to mind his steps, intoning her religion's prayer, “For the night is dark\nand full of terrors.” Cressen insists that only children fear the dark. Melisandre gives him a riddle, “A clever fool\nand a foolish wise man”, and places Patchface’s ridiculous antlered helm upon Cressen’s head, telling him “A crown\nto match your chain, Lord Maester.” All around him, Cressen hears laughter. He removes the crown, fighting his\n\nrage. He tells her he needs no crown but truth, to which Melisandre replies that some truths are not taught in Old\nTown.\nWhen he reaches the high table, Cressen sees that Stannis has given his accustomed seat to Pylos. When questioned\nwhy he did not wake him, Pylos blushes and states he was told to let Cressen rest and that Cressen was not needed\nhere. Cressen looks at the gaudy knights and captains: aged and sour Lord \nArdrian Celtigar\n, handsome Lord\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6b279a3e48b51f063e00ad44f618714cca782747493a51a15e4faa717e6441c2_v2"}
