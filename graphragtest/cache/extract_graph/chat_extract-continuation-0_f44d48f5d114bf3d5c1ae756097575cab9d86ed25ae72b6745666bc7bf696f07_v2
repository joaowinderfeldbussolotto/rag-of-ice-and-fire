She thinks that Varys might have known\nabout the secret passage and acted on behalf of Stannis. She orders Ser Meryn to find the \nMaster of Whisperers\n and\nbring him to her.\nSer Boros returns red-faced and puffing, announcing that Tyrion is gone, his cell open, with no sign of him\nanywhere. Cersei is appalled, thinking her nightmares are coming true. She points out her orders to keep the Imp\nunder guard day and night. Ser Boros says that a goaler called \nRugen\n has gone missing while two others were found\nasleep. She orders for them to be killed. Cersei's paranoia about Tyrion breaks out fully and reflects that he has\nalready killed her mother, her father and her eldest son and will try to murder her too, remembering the prophecy\nshe once received about her little brother killing her. She gets queasy and Ser Boros tries to sustain her, but she\nrecoils from his touch, thinking that the knight of the Kingsguard might be one of Tyrion's creatures, too. He offers\nher a cup of water, but all she wants is Tyrion's blood. She envisions Tyrion grinning at her, feeling his hands\nclosing in around her neck the very moment she thought she was rid of him.\nNavigation:\nChapter 2\n ←\nCersei I\n→ \nBrienne I\n↓\nCersei II\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 4: Brienne I\nPlace(s): \nRosby road\n between \nKing's Landing\n and \nDuskendale\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei I\n ←\nBrienne I\n→ \nSamwell I\n↓\nBrienne II\nSynopsis\nBrienne\n is traveling to \nDuskendale\n, seeking the whereabouts of \nSansa\n as she was charged to do by \nJaime\n. Having\nfound few leads in \nKing's Landing\n, Brienne is asking nearly everyone she can along the roads and villages, but never\nmentions Sansa by name. Upon \nthe road\n beyond \nRosby\n, she comes upon a camp with two hedge knights who offer\nto share their meal. Mistaking her at first for a man, Ser \nIllifer\n later remarks on how she bears a shield with the sigil\nof \nHouse Lothston\n, a disgraced family who once held \nHarrenhal\n. Brienne was given the shield by Ser Jaime, who\nhad taken it from Harrenhal. When she tells the two that she lost her own shield, Ser Illifer figures out by her size\nthat she must be Brienne, murderess of King \nRenly\n. The Maid denies having killed Renly, and the hedge knights\nagree to travel with her to Duskendale.\nAfter passing a large group of poor fellows (or '\nsparrows\n'), lowly holy men bound for King's Landing bearing the\nbones of septons killed around the Riverlands, they catch up to a merchant guarded by a couple of men and another\nhedge knight named Ser \nShadrich\n. Joining forces along the dangerous road, Ser Shadrich tells Brienne in private that\nhe knows that the maid she seeks is Sansa Stark, and that he seeks her as well, but for a purse of gold offered by\nVarys\n. Brienne is disturbed by the fact that the knight knew whom she was speaking of when she repeated Sansa's\ndescription to the merchant's group. When the party stops at an inn for the night, Brienne slips off on her own,\nswearing to herself that she will not fail Jaime, having already failed King Renly and Lady \nCatelyn\n.\nNavigation:\nCersei I\n ←\nBrienne I\n→ \nSamwell I\n↓\nBrienne II\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 5: Samwell I\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell V\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nBrienne I\n ←\nSamwell I\n→ \nArya I\n↓\nSamwell II\nThe events of this chapter are later revisited in \nChapter 7 of \nA Dance with Dragons\n, but from \nJon's\n perspective rather\nthan \nSamwell Tarly\n's.\nSynopsis\nDown in the library beneath \nCastle Black\n, \nSam\n is trying to dig up any information on the \nOthers\n for his Lord\nCommander, \nJon Snow\n. Returning to the surface, Sam considers how hard Jon has been working the men of \nthe\nWatch\n. He meets \nDolorous Edd\n, \nPyp\n, and \nGrenn\n, and they mention how much Jon has changed, acting different and\nbarely spending any time with his friends; although he never misses a day practising his sword work.

Thus far only the \nKarstarks\n, who have no other choice, have agreed to ally with Stannis.\nSam arrives at Jon's solar, and Jon shows him a letter he plans to send to King \nTommen\n which declares that Stannis\nis aiding them in their battle, but the Night's Watch is not sworn to his cause.
