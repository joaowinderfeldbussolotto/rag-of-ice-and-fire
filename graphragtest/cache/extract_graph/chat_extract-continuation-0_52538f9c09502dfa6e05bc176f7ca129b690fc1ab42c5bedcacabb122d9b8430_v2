He considers \nNagga's bones\n, where the \nGrey\nKing\n ruled for 1000 years and warred against the \nStorm God\n. At dawn, Aeron has his drowned men sound the drums\nand warhorns to announce the onset of the kingsmoot. The prophet wishes for \nVictarion\n to win the claim, and hopes\nEuron will make a mistake and declare early. But the first claimant is \nGylbert Farwynd\n, who rules a small barrier\nisland far to the west of the \nIron Islands\n where shapeshifters are said to live. Aeron sees madness in the lord's eyes.\nHe offers to lead the ironmen to a bountiful land beyond the \nSunset Sea\n; few of the gathered captains shout his\nname.\nNext up is \nErik Ironmaker\n, who once might have made a great king. But age and his immense weight make him an\neasy target for \nAsha\n to dismiss by asking him to stand up from his chair. The following claimant is another famous\nironborn, Lord \nDunstan Drumm\n, who asks the gathering, \"Where is it written that our king must be a kraken?\" But\nthe Drumm's downfall is the cheap loot he offers to swing the vote of the captains.\nVictarion steps forth next and asks for Aeron's blessing. His speech is short and concise and he offers to continue the\nrule his brother \nBalon\n set. His offerings are generous, and many captains give him their voice.\nBut it is Asha who interrupts the shouts of \"Victarion!\", and declares that her claim is best as she is Balon's\ndaughter. She tells the ironborn that war is bleeding their people and to continue it would be folly. She offers peace\nwith the Northmen, and prosperous land on the western shores of the North. When she opens her chests to show the\nscant spoils of her warring in the \nNorthlands\n, the tumult of support she receives is staggering.\nFearing that a woman will win the kingsmoot, Aeron is shocked back to reality by the horrible bellowing of a horn.\nAll eyes turn to a giant war-horn bound with ancient \nValyrian\n glyphs being sounded by \none of Euron's \"mongrels\"\n.\nAfter sounding the horn several times, the giant mute nearly falls over, his lips bloody and blistering. Euron steps\nforward and announces that he has sailed further and braved more than any other ironman. He offers not only peace\nand land, but all of \nWesteros\n itself to the ironborn. When Asha asks him how he means to do so, her uncle responds\nthat he will use dragons to conquer the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, as \nAegon\n did, using the \nDragon Horn\n he found amongst\nthe ashes of Old Valyria. When he tells the crowd that the horn can bind dragons to his will, and that he knows\nwhere three dragons can be found, he receives the overwhelming cheers of \"Euron! Euron! Crow's Eye!

She knew something like this might happen, and warned Pod to keep an eye on him. But\nhaving no recourse but to follow Dick, Brienne and Pod continue on their path to \nCrackclaw Point\n. Dick tells them\nsome of the history of the region, to pass the monotony of their journey. Brienne's mistrust of Dick has made him\ntake notice, and she considers how easy it is for her to suspect others, after the mistreatments she has suffered in her\nlife. She remembers getting her revenge on several of her false suitors during the mêlée at \nBitterbridge\n, but this has\ndone little to stay her natural distrust.\nAs they pass the \nDyre Den\n, Lord \nBrune\n's castle, Pod takes note of a rider a couple miles behind them. When Brienne\nlearns that Dick may have known Lord Brune, she considers the possibility that Dick is a deserter from the war.\nAfter passing through many a treacherous bog and forest, they finally arrive at the ruins of \nthe Whispers\n. Brienne\ncommands Pod to watch their horses, as she and Dick investigate the ruins. When they find a recently put-out\ncookfire, Brienne realizes their quarry is still around.\nThe trap is soon sprung, and the fool turns out to be \nShagwell\n of the \nBloody Mummers\n. Shagwell kills Nimble Dick\nwith his brutal morningstar, then informs Brienne that \nUrswyck\n rode south to \nOldtown\n with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
