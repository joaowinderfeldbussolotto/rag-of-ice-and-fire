Hot\nPie insists they cannot fight twenty soldiers, but Arya argues they will only have to kill the two guards at the\nstorehouse. Lommy suggests they should yield or just leave Gendry, but Arya points out they need his to help carry\nLommy. When Arya insists she is going back to try, Hot Pie reluctantly agrees to come along.\nAs they are crawling along under the gibbet, a crow lands on Hot Pie's back and the guards hear his gasp. Hot Pie\nimmediately leaps up and shouts out that he yields. By the time Arya bounces up and draws \nNeedle\n, they are\nsurrounded. She slashes at the nearest man, but he blocks her with a steel-clad arm and someone else knocks her to\nthe ground. A third man wrenches Needle away and punches her with a armored fist when she tries to bite him.\nDisoriented, Arya lies hurting and shamed by the loss of Needle, which \nJon Snow\n gave her and \nSyrio Forel\n taught\nher to use.\nWhen she is yanked to her knees, Arya finds herself facing the biggest man she has ever seen, and suddenly she\nremembers the banner with the three dogs: at the \nHand's tourney\n, Sansa told her it was the banner of \nthe Hound\n's\nbrother, Ser \nGregor Clegane\n, the Mountain that Rides, who is even bigger than \nHodor\n. After Hot Pie yields some\nmore and tells him about Lommy and Weasel, Ser Gregor orders them to lead his men there and walks off. As they\nwalk back to where Lommy and Weasel are hiding, Hot Pie promises to make pies and tarts for the four soldiers if\nthey do not hurt him.\nWhen they arrive, Lommy immediately yields and explains that Weasel ran off when she heard them coming. The\n\nsoldiers ask Lommy where they can find \nBeric Dondarrion\n, but Lommy has never heard the name. One of the guards\ndeclares it a waste of time, since Arya's group do not know any more than the villagers. \nA spearman\n drifts over to\nLommy and asks if he can walk. When Lommy says they will have to carry him, the spearman replies \"Think so?\"\nand casually drives his spear through Lommy's soft throat.\nNavigation:\nArya IV\n↑\nSansa II\n ←\nArya V\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\nArya VI\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 20: Tyrion V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion IV\n↑\nArya V\n ←\nTyrion V\n→ \nBran III\n↓\nTyrion VI\nTyrion\n visits the \nGuildhall of the Alchemists\n to discuss the production of \nwildfire\n then meets with Ser \nCleos Frey\nabout \nRobb Stark\n's peace terms. On the way back to the \nRed Keep\n, Tyrion passes a prophet preaching of corruption\nand incest. When he finds \nCersei\n waiting in his solar, the pair argue about strategy and sending \nMyrcella\n to \nDorne\n,\nwhich gives Tyrion the identity of an informer.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n is glad he took the advice to dress warmly, despite looking like a ball of striped fur bundled up in his\nshadowskin\n cloak. Deep under \nRhaenys's Hill\n, the chill in the dank vaults behind the \nGuildhall of the Alchemists\n is\nso bone-deep that even \nTimett\n retreated after a brief taste.\nBy the light of a sealed lamp, Tyrion inspects a fragile, grapefruit-shaped clay jar. The jar has a pebbled texture to\nkeep it from slipping when grasped, and when Tyrion tilts it to peer inside the murky green \nwildfire\n oozes toward\nthe lip. When Tyrion remarks on its thickness, the pallid and obsequious \nPyromancer\n \nHallyne\n explains that \"the\nsubstance\" (as the pyromancers call it) flows more easily as it warms.\nTyrion is annoyed by the alchemists' pretentiousness. Their habits of calling each other \"wisdom\" and hinting at vast\nstores of secret knowledge do not match the reality of a declining guild in moth-eaten robes who no longer even\npretend to transmute metals. The \nMaesters\n of the \nCitadel\n have supplanted the once-powerful guild in almost every\nrespect―except the creation of wildfire, which remains a closely-guarded guild secret.\nHallyne explains that once kindled, wildfire cannot be quenched and will seep into cloth, wood, leather, or even\nsteel and set them afire as well. Tyrion recalls from the flaming sword of \nThoros of Myr\n that even a thin coating can\nburn for an hour, though it ruins the sword. When Tyrion asks why the wildfire doesn't seep into the clay pots,\nHallyne explains that it does, and thus they have a lower vault full of pots from the reign of King \nAerys II\nTargaryen\n, whose fancy it was to shape the jars like fruit. By rights, those jars should be destroyed, but so many of\nthe guild's masters were killed during the \nSack of King's Landing\n that they lack the skill and have flooded the vaults\ninstead.
