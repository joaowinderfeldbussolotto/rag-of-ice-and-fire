Jaime mocks her at first, but\neventually agrees to answer her questions if she agrees to answer his. Jaime admits to being the father to all of\nCersei\n’s children, and to throwing \nBran\n out the tower window. However, Jaime denies sending the assassin after\nBran, saying, \"if I wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.\" Catelyn questions him about the dagger\nthat \nLittlefinger\n claimed \nTyrion\n had won from him. Jaime backs what Tyrion told her in the \nMountains of the Moon\n,\nthat he always bets on his brother and lost at that tourney. Jaime admits that King \nRobert\n mocked him with the\ndagger at the feast the night of the tourney, and Catelyn is dismayed that Littlefinger, who was like a brother to her\nonce, would deceive her the way he has.\nCatelyn then reveals that \nRobb\n has recently taken \nthe Crag\n from the \nWesterlings\n, and marched ever closer to\nCasterly Rock\n. Jaime then steers the conversation to what really happened to \nBrandon Stark\n and Lord \nRickard\n at the\nhands of the Mad King \nAerys\n, perhaps to absolve himself of having slain the king. Brandon was on his way to\nRiverrun when he learned of \nLyanna\n's disappearance, and instead went to \nKing's Landing\n with a handful of friends,\nall sons of prominent lords, and upon entering the \nRed Keep\n, Brandon shouted for \nRhaegar\n to \"come out and die\".\nRhaegar was not there to answer the challenge, and Aerys had Brandon and his men arrested for conspiring to\nmurder his heir. Aerys demanded the fathers of the men come to King’s Landing to answer the charges against their\nsons; when they came, both fathers and sons were murdered at the command of King Aerys, with Brandon dying of\nstrangulation trying to reach his father who was being burnt alive by Aerys' pyromancers. Jaime was a young\nmember of the \nKingsguard\n when he saw all this, and it was Ser \nGerold Hightower\n who told him, \"You swore a vow\nto guard the king, not to judge him\", whom everyone consider a better man than him.\nJaime, now fully drunk, angrily rants that he is reviled for what he considers his finest act and begins to mock \nNed\nStark\n’s honor, stating that unlike Ned, a man who fathered \na bastard\n, he has never been unfaithful and that Ned had\nno right to judge him, the man who avenged his father and brother, but Catelyn has heard enough, and calls for\nBrienne’s sword.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VI\n↑\nTyrion XII\n ←\nCatelyn VII\n→ \nTheon V\n↓\n\nA Storm of Swords\nCatelyn I\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 56: Theon V\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nTheon IV\n↑\nCatelyn VII\n ←\nTheon V\n→ \nSansa V\n↓\nTheon VI\nTheon Greyjoy\n is awoken by \nWex Pyke\n and \nReek\n and informed of the arrival of his sister, \nAsha\n. Theon meets with\nAsha, who berates him for having killed \nBran\n and \nRickon Stark\n and having mounted their heads upon the gates of\nWinterfell\n. Theon refuses to abandon his conquered seat, after which Asha leaves. As a last measure, Theon sends\nReek away with a bag of coin in search of men to defend the castle. Afterwards he has yet another nightmare, which\nmakes him realize all around him belongs to the Starks.\nSynopsis\nTheon Greyjoy\n is woken from a nightmare, in which he is being chased by \nlarge wolves\n with the faces of children,\nby his squire, \nWex Pyke\n, with \nReek\n standing behind him. Reek informs Theon that \nAsha\n has arrived. As Theon\nprepares to see his sister, he thinks back about the nightmares he has been having lately, ever since the night he and\nReek killed the two boys at the mill. After washing his face, Theon dresses in rich clothing, only to realize that Asha\ncares more for blades. He changes again, this time dressing in felted black wool and ringmail. Lastly, he dons his\ncrown.\nTheon has taken to using guards for his own safety, while his own men have become sullen and anxious following\nthe murders of \nGelmarr\n, \nAggar\n, and \nGynir\n. Although the three \nironborn\n had been killed by Reek with Theon's\npermission, to ensure they would not be able to reveal what had happened at the mill the night they returned with the\ncorpses of the children, Theon had felt the need to blame someone for their deaths. To that end, he had executed\nFarlen\n, going as far as to personally execute him like \nEddard Stark\n would have done. The memory is a sour one, as it\nhad taken him four difficult blows to sever Farlen's head, afterward feeling sick about it.\nHis men would prefer to leave \nWinterfell\n, a thought that makes Theon angry.
