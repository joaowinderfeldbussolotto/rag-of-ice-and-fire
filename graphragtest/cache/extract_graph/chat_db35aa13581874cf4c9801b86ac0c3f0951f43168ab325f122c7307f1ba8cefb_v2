He points out that the \nNorth\n is in a\nchaotic condition, the \nriverlands\n are devastated, while \nStannis Baratheon\n holds \nStorm's End\n and \nDragonstone\n. The\ncoming winter will starve out the realm. He then paints the opposition as particularly weak: King \nTommen\nBaratheon\n is just a boy, and all his potential regents come with their own problems. \nJaime Lannister\n actively avoids\nthe responsibility of ruling, and \nKevan Lannister\n is a born follower- he will only take the rule if it is offered to him.\nMace Tyrell\n will have to fight the Lannisters to become regent, and Stannis' unpopularity makes him an unlikely\nchoice. That leaves only one potential candidate: \nCersei\n. Tyrion is particularly scathing of his sister's ability to rule,\ncomparing her to some of the worst Targaryen kings, noting that Cersei, in her paranoia and impatience, will undo\nall the alliances his father created to secure Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne and adds that if Aegon acts quickly,\nhe can take advantage of the chaos and make serious gains before Cersei is overthrown and someone more\n\ncompetent takes her place.\nWhen Aegon protests, asking how they can win without his aunt and her \ndragons\n, Tyrion points out that he doesn't\nhave to conquer the Seven Kingdoms; he only needs to start winning victories, acting not as a beggar, but a true\nscion of \nHouse Targaryen\n, like his ancestor \nAegon the Conqueror\n. When he does, word of it will get back to\nDaenerys, and she and Aegon can meet as equals. Tyrion is convinced that Daenerys will fly to Aegon's side and\nimmediately love him, as he is the last of her line, and she is above all a \"rescuer\".\nTo re-emphasize his point to Aegon about trusting no one if he wants to survive in the game of thrones, Tyrion wins\nthe cyvasse game using a piece of bad advice he gave and which the prince took at the start of the game. Aegon does\nnot take his loss well; the sudden burst of anger convinces Tyrion the boy \nmight be a Targaryen after all\n.\nLater that evening,Haldon takes Tyrion into Selhorys in search of information, where they confirm the rumors that\nDaenerys still has not left Meereen. They need to know more, so Haldon takes Tyrion into an inn where they bribe a\ncustoms officer. \nQavo Nogarys\n, to learn more. They learn many things, such as the fact the rulers of \nYunkai\n are\nspreading slanderous propaganda and offering heavy bribes to convince \nVolantis\n to side with them against\nDaenerys, whose attack on the slave trade has made her enemies in Volantis. By contrast, it is learned that the red\npriests of \nR'hllor\n, particularly the High Priest \nBenerro\n are supporting Daenerys, and preach Volantis's destruction if\nthe city's rulers side against her, along with other apocalyptic prophecies. There are also rumors of Khal \nPono\n's\nkhalasar\n approaching the city, though they are confident they can, as usual, buy off the Dothraki.\nLater, Tyrion convinces Haldon to let him find a brothel and goes searching for \nTysha\n. He finds his way into a cheap\nbrothel where he fucks a Westerosi looking girl, retches, fucks her again and then leaves ashamed of himself. On his\nway out, he stumbles drunkenly into a \nWesterosi man\n who takes him prisoner to be \"delivered to the queen\".\nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nDaenerys IV\n↓\nTyrion VII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 23: Daenerys IV\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys III\n↑\nTyrion VI\n ←\nDaenerys IV\n→ \nThe Lost Lord\n↓\nDaenerys V\nThis article or section is a \nstub\n.
