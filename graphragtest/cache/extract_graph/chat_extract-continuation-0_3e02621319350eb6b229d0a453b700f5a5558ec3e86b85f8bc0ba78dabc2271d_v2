This leads Cressen to recall that Ser Davos was once a notorious smuggler who sailed a\nblack ship past a \nRedwyne\n blockade in the dead of night to deliver onions and salt fish to Stannis’ starving garrison\nduring the \nSiege of Storm's End\n. It allowed them to survive until Lord \nEddard Stark\n could lift the siege. Stannis\nknighted Davos for his deed. However, as punishment for his past misdeeds, Stannis himself cut short all the fingers\non Davos’ left hand save the thumb; Davos had insisted that Stannis do the cutting. Cressen realizes that a man like\nthat would give no false hope to Stannis. Ser Davos declares that if Stannis marches on \nKing's Landing\n now, as is\nhis intent, with so small an army it will only be to die. Cressen responds that Davos has done all he can and that it is\nnow his turn.\nCressen finds Stannis in the top room of the keep, looking down at the \nPainted Table\n, which is shaped as a detailed\nmap of the continent of \nWesteros\n. Stannis greets him with the statement that he knew Cressen would come even\nwithout a summons. He says that Cressen is now old and needs his sleep, and that he would have learned what\nDavos knew on his own anyway. Talk between the maester and the king quickly turns into a rant by Stannis about\nhow the \nBaratheon\n birthright of Storm’s End, the Stormlands, and its income should have passed to him rather than\nRenly when their brother \nRobert\n assumed the \nIron Throne\n. Stannis did not want Dragonstone, but when his brother\ncommanded it, he occupied it and built his brother’s fleets. It is an old grievance made new by the fact that\nDragonstone, ancient and strong though it is, commands the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords whose stony\nisland holdings are too thinly occupied to supply the men that Stannis needs to seize his rightful throne.\nCressen explains that Robert did him an injustice, but gave him lordship of Dragonstone because a man’s strength\nwas needed to hold it and Renly was just a boy. Stannis declares that Renly is \nstill\n a boy, a thieving child who has\nnever done anything to deserve the throne. Stannis wonders aloud why the gods inflicted him with brothers. Then he\nasks about the advice Renly gets from his maester, but Cressen doubts that Renly would seek council; Renly is bold\nand heedless, much like Robert.\nWhen Stannis asks what he is to tell the few anxious bannermen he does command, Maester Cressen reminds him\nthat \nHouse Lannister\n is his true enemy and suggests that he join with Renly to defeat them. Stannis flatly refuses.\nCressen yields immediately and suggests a partnership with the new \nKing in the North\n, \nRobb Stark\n, who commands\nall the power of \nWinterfell\n and \nRiverrun\n. Stannis again refuses, claiming that Robb is a green boy and another false\nking that seeks to steal half of his kingdom. Cressen suggests that half a realm is better than none and that Robb may\n\neven submit in exchange for help in avenging his father, but Stannis remains adamant and launches into another rant\nabout the slights he received at the hands of his brother Robert:\n“Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, \nRobert\n loved him, to be sure. Loved\nhim as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known\nby the way he treated me. I held \nStorm's End\n for him, watching good men starve while \nMace Tyrell\n and \nPaxter\nRedwyne\n feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked \nStark\n, for lifting the siege\nwhen we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name.\nDid he ever take my hand and say, \nWell done, brother, whatever should I do without you?\n No, he blamed\nme for letting \nWillem Darry\n steal away \nViserys\n and \nthe babe\n, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council\nfor fifteen years, helping \nJon Arryn\n rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my\nbrother name me his \nHand\n? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor.\nAnd small good it did either of them.”\nCressen then proposes a marriage pact between Shireen and young \nRobert Arryn\n. Stannis dismisses the possibility of\nbringing the weak and sickly Robert to Dragonstone, as planned before Lord Arryn’s death, because \nLysa Arryn\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
