When the pass begins, Clegane’s mount breaks into a hard gallop immediately, while Ser Loras’ mare charges\nsmoothly. They meet while Gregor is still struggling with his mount, shield, and lance. Ser Loras' lance strikes\nGregor perfectly, sending him down with his mount. Ser Loras’ lance is not even broken, and the crowd cheers\nwhen he raises his visor in victory.\nGregor gets up in a rage, demands his sword, and nearly beheads his horse with a single blow. He then strides\ntoward Ser Loras and sends the Knight of Flowers to the ground with his first blow. He is about to deliver a killing\nblow when the Hound intercedes. Gregor sends multiple sword blows toward his brother’s head, but the Hound\nstops each one, remaining on the defensive. The Hound drops to his knee when he hears the King’s voice over the\ncrowd. The blow from Gregor passes through air, and finally Gregor comes to his senses, drops his sword, glares at\nKing Robert, and storms off. In gratitude, Ser Loras forfeits the championship to the Hound, so there is no final\njoust. The crowd cheers for the Hound for the first time in his life.\nAs they head towards the archery field, Littlefinger points out that Ser Loras had to know his mare was in heat and\nthat such a thing would disrupt Ser Gregor’s stallion. A boy named \nAnguy\n wins the archery event, and Ned sends\nAlyn\n to offer him a position among his guards, but the boy refuses. \nThoros of Myr\n, who fights with a flaming sword,\nwins the melee that starts with nearly 40 men and lasts three hours. When the list of injuries is reported, Ned is\npleased that Robert did not take part.\nThat night at the feast, Ned remains more hopeful than he has been in a long while. Robert is in a good humor, the\nLannisters are nowhere in sight, and even his daughters are behaving. Sansa speaks to \nArya\n pleasantly and even asks\nhow her dancing has gone. Arya happily explains that she is sore all over and shows a nasty bruise on her leg. Sansa\ndeclares that Arya must be a terrible dancer.\nLater, Ned examines Arya’s bruise himself while she stands on one leg, at which she has improved. He asks if \nSyrio\nForel\n is being too hard on her, but Arya replies that every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Ned is\n\nconcerned, even though Syrio came with an excellent reputation and the \nBraavosi\n-style suits Arya’s slim blade. He\nrecalls finding Arya wandering the castle blindfolded because Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears, nose, and\nskin. Arya has also been practicing spins and back-flips. Ned offers to have someone else take over her lessons, but\nArya insists she wants Syrio. Ned knows that any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the basics of sword\nfighting without the blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping around on one leg, but he also knows there is no use\narguing with Arya.\nNed returns to his solar, thinking of what he has learned. He takes out the dagger and wonders why \nTyrion\nLannister\n, or anyone else, would want \nBran\n dead. He is sure that Bran’s fall is somehow linked to the death of \nJon\nArryn\n, but the truth eludes him. \nJory\n is still in the process of searching the whorehouses, and Ned is sure \nGendry\n is a\nbastard son of Robert. There is also \nEdric Storm\n, a bastard Robert was forced to recognize because \nhis mother\n was\nhighborn. He also remembers Robert’s \nfirst child\n from when Robert was still a boy himself. Yet no bastard can\nthreaten Robert’s trueborn children, since bastards have few inheritance rights.\nA knock at the door brings a stranger, who turns out to be \nVarys\n in disguise. Ned is amazed; he has never seen\nVarys wear anything but silk, velvet, and perfume yet now the eunuch wears coarse-spun clothes, mud-caked boots,\nand smells of sweat. Ned exclaims that he would never have recognized Varys. The eunuch says this is good\nbecause he would rather the queen’s spies not know about their meeting either.\nVarys reveals to Ned that the Lannisters had hoped to kill Robert during the melee. When Ned asks why Cersei\nwould forbid Robert to compete if she planned to have him killed, Varys points out that the surest way to make\nRobert compete would be to forbid it. Ned is furious that Varys did not tell him, but soon admits that he would have\ngone straight to Robert, who would have fought to show his enemies he did not fear them.\nVarys explains to Ned that there are two sorts of people in the \nRed Keep\n: those loyal to the realm and those loyal to\nonly to themselves. Varys says he now knows Ned to be loyal to the realm because he dissuaded the king from\nentering the melee. Varys also reveals that Cersei fears Ned because Robert will never harm him, not even at her\ncommand, whereas Robert would execute Varys in a twinkling at queen’s request since the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SER GREGOR<|>PERSON<|>Ser Gregor is a knight with poor horsemanship who struggles to control his stallion and loses a joust to Ser Loras)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER LORAS<|>PERSON<|>Ser Loras, also known as the Knight of Flowers, is a skilled horseman who defeats Ser Gregor in a joust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HOUND<|>PERSON<|>The Hound is Ser Gregor's brother who intervenes to stop Gregor from killing Ser Loras)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER HUGH<|>PERSON<|>Ser Hugh is mentioned briefly in the text, though no further details are provided)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>King Robert is the ruler who stops Gregor's attack and is later revealed to be a target of the Lannisters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>PERSON<|>Littlefinger is a cunning character who points out Ser Loras' strategy in the joust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANGUY<|>PERSON<|>Anguy is a boy who wins the archery event but refuses Ned's offer to join his guards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALYN<|>PERSON<|>Alyn is a person sent by Ned to offer Anguy a position among his guards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOROS OF MYR<|>PERSON<|>Thoros of Myr is a warrior who fights with a flaming sword and wins the melee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NED<|>PERSON<|>Ned is a lord who is concerned about his daughters, investigates Bran's fall, and interacts with Varys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>Sansa is Ned's daughter who speaks pleasantly to Arya and comments on her dancing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>Arya is Ned's daughter who is training in sword fighting with Syrio Forel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRIO FOREL<|>PERSON<|>Syrio Forel is a Braavosi sword-fighting instructor who trains Arya in unconventional methods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion Lannister is a Lannister who Ned suspects of wanting Bran dead)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAN<|>PERSON<|>Bran is Ned's son whose fall is linked to Jon Arryn's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>PERSON<|>Jon Arryn is a deceased figure whose death is connected to Bran's fall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JORY<|>PERSON<|>Jory is a person searching whorehouses for information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDRY<|>PERSON<|>Gendry is suspected to be a bastard son of King Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDRIC STORM<|>PERSON<|>Edric Storm is a recognized bastard son of King Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VARYS<|>PERSON<|>Varys is a eunuch and spymaster who reveals the Lannisters' plot to kill King Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERSEI<|>PERSON<|>Cersei is the queen who fears Ned and is involved in plots against King Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED KEEP<|>GEO<|>The Red Keep is the castle where Ned and Varys discuss the Lannisters' plots)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAAVOSI<|>GEO<|>Braavosi refers to the style of sword fighting that Syrio Forel teaches Arya)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER GREGOR<|>SER LORAS<|>Ser Gregor loses a joust to Ser Loras and later attacks him in a rage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE HOUND<|>SER GREGOR<|>The Hound is Ser Gregor's brother who stops him from killing Ser Loras<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE HOUND<|>SER LORAS<|>The Hound intervenes to save Ser Loras from Gregor's attack<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER LORAS<|>KING ROBERT<|>Ser Loras forfeits the championship to the Hound at King Robert's presence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>ARYA<|>Ned is concerned about Arya's training and bruises but ultimately respects her choice of instructor<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>SYRIO FOREL<|>Arya is trained by Syrio Forel in unconventional sword-fighting techniques<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>SYRIO FOREL<|>Ned is concerned about Syrio Forel's training methods but allows Arya to continue<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>VARYS<|>Varys reveals the Lannisters' plot to kill King Robert to Ned<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VARYS<|>CERSEI<|>Varys discusses Cersei's fear of Ned and her involvement in plots against King Robert<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>Ned suspects Tyrion Lannister of wanting Bran dead<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>BRAN<|>Ned investigates Bran's fall and its connection to Jon Arryn's death<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>JON ARRYN<|>Ned believes Bran's fall is linked to Jon Arryn's death<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>GENDRY<|>Ned suspects Gendry is a bastard son of King Robert<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>EDRIC STORM<|>Ned acknowledges Edric Storm as another bastard son of King Robert<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>RED KEEP<|>Ned meets with Varys in the Red Keep to discuss the Lannisters' plots<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
