He suggests that if they could keep their tongues it would be easier, but the\ntorchbearer replies that the risk is too great.\nArya follows the two men for a long time, going deeper and deeper down the hall until dirt and timbers replace the\ndressed stone. After miles of following, the men are gone and Arya, blind and lost, can see no way to go but\nforward. At the end she is knee deep in stinking water, and eventually, she finds herself at the mouth of a sewer that\nempties into the river. She is so dirty and stinky that she removes her clothes and swims until she feels clean. When\nshe looks around, Arya can see the Red Keep on its hill, miles away.\nWhen she finally reaches the gate to the Red Keep and asks to be let in, the two gold cloaks on guard sneer at her\nbecause she looks like a beggar. She tells them she is not a beggar, she lives there, and she wants to see her father.\nOne of the guards jokes that he wants to fuck the queen for all the good it does him. When Arya insists her father is\nthe Hand of the King, one of the guards tries to strike her, but she jumps away and insists she is Arya Stark and that\nif they lay a hand on her their heads will end up on spikes. She offers that if they need proof of who she is \nJory\nCassel\n or \nVayon Poole\n can vouch for her. She finishes by asking the startled guardsmen if they will open the gate or\nneed a clap on the head to improve their hearing.\nArya is brought to her father in his solar by \nTomard\n and \nHarwin\n. He is bent over the biggest book Arya has ever\nseen. As he hears the report, his face is stern. He then tells her that he had half his guard searching for her, and that\nshe is not supposed to go beyond the gates without his leave. She replies that she was in the dungeons, and they\nturned into tunnels, she did not have a light, and she could not go back the way she came because of the monsters.\nShe then continues to say that two men were talking about killing him. They said that he had a book and a bastard,\nand if one Hand could die, why not another. Ned is confused. Arya describes the two men, and that they said that the\nwolf and lion would eat each other. Everything mixes up in Arya’s head. She tells her father that she thinks one was\na wizard. She decides not to mention knocking over the prince, and how she went into a window and found\nmonsters. Ned confirms that the men were talking about juggling and mummers, and tells her that they must be\nmummers and that there must be a dozen troupes in \nKing's Landing\n now. Arya tries to tell him that they were not\nmummers, but he interrupts her, saying she should not be spying on people. Then he states he does not want his\ndaughter crawling through strange windows going after stray cats and notes all the scratches on her arms. He\ncontinues by stating this has gone on long enough and that he wants a word with Syrio. The announcement of an\narrival from the \nNight's Watch\n interrupts their conversation.\nYoren\n is ushered in and Ned greets him pleasantly despite his being stooped, ugly, smelly, and in unwashed clothes.\nYoren apologizes for the hour, and states that Ayra has the look of Ned’s son. Arya replies that she is a girl, and then\nasks about her brothers since she assumes Yoren must have come by way of \nWinterfell\n, and if he can deliver a letter\nto Jon, thinking Jon will believe her story of the men in the dungeon. Yoren explains to Ned that he is there to find\n\nmen for \nthe Wall\n, but he has other news, news that should be told in private. Ned tells \nDesmond\n to show Arya to her\nroom. She tries to confirm that nothing bad has happened to \nJon\n or \nher uncle\n, and Yoren tells her that Jon is fine.\nAs Desmond takes her to her room, Arya asks him how many guards her father has. He answers 50. Then Arya\nwants assurance that they will not let anybody kill her father, so Desmond tells her that they guard him day and\nnight. Arya mentions that the Lannisters have many more men, and he answers that a northerner is worth 10\nsoutherners. When she asks about wizards, he says a wizard dies the same as anyone else when you cut his head off.\nNavigation:\nArya II\n↑\nTyrion IV\n ←\nArya III\n→ \nEddard VIII\n↓\nArya IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 33: Eddard VIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard VII\n↑\nArya III\n ←\nEddard VIII\n→ \nCatelyn VI\n↓\nEddard IX\nNed\n and King \nRobert\n argue over a plot to kill \nDaenerys Targaryen\n.
