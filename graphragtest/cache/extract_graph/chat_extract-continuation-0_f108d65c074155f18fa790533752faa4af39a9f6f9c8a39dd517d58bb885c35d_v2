Tywin admits that it was done too brutally,\nand Elia did not need to be harmed. The Mountain only killed her because Tywin did not tell him to spare her.\nTywin asserts that at the time, he had greater concerns than the Dornish princess; Ned Stark’s van was rushing south\nfrom \nthe Trident\n, and Tywin feared coming to battle with him, as well as the possibility of Aerys murdering \nJaime\npurely out of spite. \"That, and what Jaime himself might do.\" He also did not know what Gregor Clegane was\ncapable of, only that he was huge and terrible in battle. He did not command Clegane to rape Elia, and Ser Amory\nwas almost as bestial with Rhaenys. When Tywin asked Ser Armory why it had required fifty thrusts to kill a girl of\ntwo or three, he claimed she’d kicked him and would not stop screaming. He states that if Lorch had had any wits,\nhe would have calmed her with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow.\nTyrion asks whether it was a soft sweet pillow that killed Robb Stark. Lord Tywin reveals that the plan was to kill\nRobb at his uncle's wedding with an arrow, as he was too circumspect in the field. Tyrion inquires about the fate of\nRobb's mother. Lord Tywin suspects that the reference to \"a pair of wolf pelts\" in Lord Walder's message implies\nthat Lady Catelyn is dead, too. The original idea was to keep her as captive, but maybe something went wrong, he\nsuggests. Tyrion points out that the sacred guest right has been violated. Lord Tywin replies: \"The blood is on\nWalder Frey’s hands, not mine.\" Tyrion, describing him as an ill-natured old lecher who nourishes the slights he has\nsuffered over his long life, says he has no doubt that Lord Walder has planned the whole thing, yet he would never\nhave dared to go through with it if he hadn't been given the promise of protection. Tywin counters that refusing him\nwould have meant keeping him loyal to Robb Stark and prolonging the war. He considers the price that was paid\nlow: The Crown will grant Riverrun to \nEmmon Frey\n as soon as the Blackfish yields, while \nLancel\n and \nDaven\nLannister\n have to marry Frey girls and \nGerion Lannister\n's bastard daughter \nJoy\n will be wedded to one of Lord\nWalder's natural sons, once she is old enough. \nRoose Bolton\n becomes \nWarden of the North\n and his \nbastard son\n will\nmarry \nArya Stark\n.\nThe revelation that Lord Bolton was involved in the conspiracy is not particularly surprising to Tyrion, as Lord\nWalder probably had not the stomach to act alone. However, he is baffled about the role assigned to Arya and points\nout that neither \nVarys\n nor Ser \nJacelyn Bywater\n were able to locate the girl, thus he is sure she is dead. Lord Tywin\nreplies: \"So was \nRenly\n, until the \nBlackwater\n.\" Tyrion doesn't understand what this means. Lord Tywin replies that\nLittlefinger might have succeeded where Tyrion and Varys failed. He suggests that the Boltons shall be fighting the\nIronborn\n for a few years while the Crown will keep an eye on their efforts to subjugate the Starks' other bannermen.\n\nLord Tywin expects that the remaining insurgents will be ready to yield by spring, also pointing out that the North\nwill eventually go to the son of Tyrion and Sansa. In this context, he reminds Tyrion that Joffrey is not the only one\nwho must take a maidenhead. Tyrion asks his father acidly when he believes his wife to be most fertile; before or\nafter he tells her that the Lannisters have killed her mother and brother.\nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nArya XI\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nDavos V\n↓\nTyrion VII\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 54: Davos V\nPlace(s): \nDragonstone\n \n \nNavigation:\nDavos IV\n↑\nTyrion VI\n ←\nDavos V\n→ \nJon VII\n↓\nDavos VI\nSynopsis\nSalladhor Saan\n tells King \nStannis Baratheon\n of the \nRed Wedding\n, how the \nFreys\n sewed the head of \nRobb Stark\n's\ndirewolf, \nGrey Wind\n, on the king's shoulders and nailed a crown on its head. \nCatelyn Stark\n was slain and thrown\nnaked into the river.
