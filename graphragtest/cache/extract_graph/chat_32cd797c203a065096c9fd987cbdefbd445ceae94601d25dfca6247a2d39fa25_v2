Scouting ahead of them go \nTom Barleycorn\n, \nBig Liddle\n and \nLuke of Longtown\n.\nThere are six new recruits - \nHareth the Horse\n from \nMole's Town\n, \nArron\n and \nEmrick\n from \nFair Isle\n, \nSatin\n from\nOldtown\n and the \nwildlings\n \nLeathers\n and \nJax\n.\nOf the sixty-three wildlings that Jon invited to join the Watch, Leathers and Jax are the only two to accept so far.\nAmong the others wildlings come to the wall, nineteen are girls and women and were sent to \nHardin's Tower\n to\navoid trouble with the men in \nCastle Black\n. Their presence makes the men uneasy and there has already been an\nincident. The \nspearwives\n know how to defend themselves and their girls, and three men had to be locked in ice cells.\nJon means to garrison \nDeep Lake\n, \nSable Hall\n and \nLong Barrow\n with wildlings under command of offices of the\nNight's Watch, and to choose an almost completely female contingent for Long Barrow in order to avoid future\nharassment. \nIron Emmett\n and \nDolorous Edd\n will be Long Barrow's commander and chief steward.\nOther wildlings are also a cause of tension and incidents with the Brothers of the Night's Watch, most noticeably\nHalleck\n and his followers. Jon is also worried that the \nThenns\n may blame him for the death of \nStyr\n.\nTom Barleycorn finds a small group of wildlings, including a child and his mother, a Thenn, a \nHornfoot\n and \na giant\nin the weirwood grove. With the advantage of surprise and an effort at diplomacy from Leathers, they succeed in\navoiding a fight and even convince the survivors to return to Castle Black with them.\nThe recruits swear their vows in the presence of the wildlings. As he hears the verse about guarding \nthe realms of\nmen\n, Jon realizes that his duties involve protecting the wildlings as well as any other men.\nThey return to Castle Black, bringing the two wildling corpses they found with them. Jon consigns the corpses to the\nice cells and receives a letter from \nStannis\n, learning that he succeeded at \ntaking Deepwood Motte\n and received\nsupport from various northern clans and houses along the way, including survivors from the \nbattle at Winterfell\n. His\ntroops now number five thousand and growing. Stannis has also learned that \nRamsay Bolton\n means to marry \nArya\n in\nWinterfell\n and promises Jon to save her if he can. He means to have the help of \nArnolf Karstark\n and \nMors Umber\n at\nhis attempt to conquer Winterfell.\nJon wonders if Arya could have escaped without Stannis's help, as predicted by \nMelisandre\n.\nNavigation:\nJon VI\n↑\nBran III\n ←\nJon VII\n→ \nDaenerys VI\n↓\n\nJon VIII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 36: Daenerys VI\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys V\n↑\nJon VII\n ←\nDaenerys VI\n→ \nThe Prince of Winterfell\n↓\nDaenerys VII\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n visits the thousands of \nAstapori\n camped outside \nMeereen\n.
