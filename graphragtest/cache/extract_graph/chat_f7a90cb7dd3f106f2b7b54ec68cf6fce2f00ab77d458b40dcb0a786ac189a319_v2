Talk of a she-wolf makes Arya wonder if the Gods Eye is near the \nTrident\n, where she was forced to\n\nleave her \ndirewolf\n \nNymeria\n. One of the travellers claims that this she-wolf once snatched a baby from its mother’s\narms in the midst of a village, and that the men who pursued lost all of their dogs and nearly their lives. Arya blurts\nout that this is just a story because wolves do not eat babies. The man asks what Arya would know about wolves, but\nYoren gives her a shove and orders her outside before she can answer.\nOutside, the youngest and handsomest of the three men in the wagon calls to her with a friendly voice. Arya\napproaches warily with one hand on \nNeedle\n. The man is slender and fine-featured with red hair on one side and\nwhite on the other. He speaks in a strange syntax, referring to himself as “a man” and to Arya as “a boy,” and his\naccent reminds her of \nSyrio Forel\n. He asks for another beer and suggests he could use a bath, claiming Arya could\nmake a friend. Arya insist that she has friends, but the noseless prisoner remarks that he cannot see any. The third\nprisoner only hisses and sticks out the stump of his tongue.\nThe friendly prisoner begs forgiveness for his present company, and introduces himself as \nJaqen H'ghar\n from\nLorath\n. He introduces the noseless man as \nRorge\n and the other as \nBiter\n (a name Jaqen gave the mute because of his\nfiled teeth). Rorge curses and throws his tankard at Arya, demanding more beer, but she manages to dodge. Asking\nherself what Syrio would do, Arya draws her practice sword. Rorge threatens her, but Arya recalls her mantra, “Fear\ncuts deeper than swords,” and approaches the wagon. When Biter lurches at her, Arya hits him hard right between\nthe eyes. Biter reels back but then throws all his weight against his chains and attempts to grab her again. When the\nbonds hold and Biter collapses, Jaqen H’ghar observes that Arya has more courage than sense.\nArya backs away from the wagon again. When she feels a hand on her shoulder she whirls around, but it is only the\nBull, who reminds her that Yoren warned them not to go near the three in the wagon. Arya insists they do not scare\nher, but the Bull replies, “Then you’re stupid. They scare me.” As the Bull leads her away, Arya hears Rorge\nlaughing and Biter hissing behind them.\nWanting to hit something, Arya asks if the Bull wants to fight. Startled, he warns her how strong he is, but Arya\nargues that she is quick. The Bull draws Praed’s longsword and declares it cheap steal, but still a real sword. Arya\ndraws Needle and declares that it is good steel, which makes it even realer. They each ask the other to promise not to\ncry if they get cut. Arya assumes her \nwater dancer\n's stance, but the Bull is distracted by six \ngold cloaks\n riding up the\nkingsroad on lathered horses.\nAs the gold cloaks draw up in front of the inn, Arya pulls the Bull behind a tall hedge and tells him to be quiet as a\nshadow. The gold cloak officer asks some of the recruits outside the bathhouse if they are the ones who left King’s\nLanding to take the black. The men say they might be, so the officer dismounts and declares he has a warrant for a\ncertain boy.\nYoren steps out of the inn to ask who wants the boy. The officer presents his warrant and declares that Queen \nCersei\nsent them. Behind the hedge, the Bull asks why he and Arya are hiding. Arya explains that it her they are after. The\nBull asks why the queen would want her, but Arya tells him to be quiet. Yoren declares the warrant pretty, but\ninsists that the boy is in the Night’s Watch so what he did back in the city does not matter. The officer declares that\nneither he nor the queen cares. Arya considers running, but knows she cannot escape. She decides she is tired of\nrunning; a real water dancer would never run.\nYoren insists that the gold cloaks will have no one, since there are laws on such things. The officer draws his\nshortsword and declares it his law. Yoren only looks at the blade and declares, “That’s no law, just a sword.\nHappens I got one too.” The officer threatens that he has five men with him, but Yoren spits and declares that he has\nthirty. A gold cloak with a broken nose laughs and asks who is first. In a gesture of solidarity, Tarber takes up a\npitchfork, \nCutjack\n pulls out his hammer, \nKurz\n draws his skinning knife, \nKoss\n strings his longbow, \nReysen\n snatches\nup his staff, \nDobber\n (fresh from the bath) drops everything but his dagger, and \nHot Pie\n scrambles to find a big rock.\nArya is amazed; she hates Hot Pie, so why would he risk his\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f7a90cb7dd3f106f2b7b54ec68cf6fce2f00ab77d458b40dcb0a786ac189a319_v2"}
