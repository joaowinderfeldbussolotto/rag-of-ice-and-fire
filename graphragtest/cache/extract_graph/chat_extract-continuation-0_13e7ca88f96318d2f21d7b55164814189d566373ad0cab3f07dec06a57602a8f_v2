Later Jon talks with Sam and, afterwards, convinces\nthe other recruits to go easy on Sam, despite Thorne’s commands.\nSynopsis\nJon\n is helping the other recruits with their swordsmanship when \nSamwell Tarly\n, the fattest boy he has ever seen,\nenters the yard. Sam nervously explains he has been told to come there for training, and \nPyp\n identifies him by his\nvoice as a lordling from near \nHighgarden\n. Sam is immediately ridiculed by Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n, who says they are\nnow sending pigs to man \nthe Wall\n. Although Sam has brought his own armor, none of it is black so he has to be\nreequipped, which requires some ingenuity by the armorer.\nWhen Sam returns, Ser Alliser sends \nHalder\n, a very strong boy, against him. In under a minute Sam is on the ground\nwith a broken helm, screaming that he yields. When Sam refuses to stand up, Thorne tells Halder to hit him with the\nflat of the blade until he gets up. The initial hit is tentative, but Thorne insists that Halder can hit harder and the next\nblow splits leather. Jon’s objections are initially stopped by Pyp, but after another blow Jon shakes him off and\nstates there is no honor in beating a beaten foe.\nJon helps Sam up, which Ser Alliser mocks as “defending his lady love.” Declaring it a training exercise, Thorne\nsends Halder, \nRast\n, and \nAlbett\n to get past Jon to beat Sam. Jon braces himself for a hard fight; Ser Alliser has sent\ntwo boys against him before, but never three. To Jon’s surprise, Pyp and \nGrenn\n come to his aid. The boys going\nagainst Jon hesitate, but Jon attacks. Jon soon takes out Halder, but not before taking a damaging blow to his\nshoulder. Then he helps Pyp take down Rast. Once Rast is down, Albett yields and Ser Alliser leaves in a fury.\nHalder wrenches off his helmet and throws it across the yard, declaring that he thought he had Jon. Jon admits that\nhe almost did. When Jon attempts to remove his helmet, his shoulder is painful. Sam, his head bloody where his\nhelmet had been split, comes over and helps Jon remove the helmet gently. Sam introduces himself and Jon\nintroduces himself, Grenn, and Pyp; Sam thanks them all. When asked why he did not fight back, Sam states that\ncouldn’t because he is a coward. Jon and his friends are speechless—who would admit that he was coward? Seeing\nthe response of Jon and his friends, Sam apologizes to them, stating he does not like being a coward. As Sam leaves\nfor the armory, Jon tells him tomorrow he will do better, but Sam insists that he will not.\nAfter Sam leaves, Grenn states nobody likes cowards, and is worried what others will think if they are associated\nwith a coward. Pyp’s response is that if Grenn met a bear in the woods he would be too stupid to run away. Grenn\ninsists he would run faster than Pyp, then attacks Pyp when he realizes the trick.\nFor the recruits, mornings are for swordplay and afternoons for other work, which is varied so that the Watch can\nmeasure a recruit’s skills. That afternoon Jon is to spread gravel on top of the wall by himself. This gives him a\nchance to contemplate Sam. He thinks about \nTyrion Lannister\n’s statement about denying a hard truth and realizes\nthat Sam’s admission of cowardice took a certain kind of courage.\nWhen he enters the common hall where dinner is almost done, Jon passes his friends and joins Sam, who is sitting\n\nby himself. After introducing \nGhost\n and some polite conversation, Jon asks Sam to join him outside to talk. As they\nwalk, Sam admits that he did not think the \nNight’s Watch\n would be like this; all the buildings are falling down, and\nit is so cold. Jon suggests it must have been warmer where Sam lived, and Sam explains that he had never seen snow\nuntil a month ago.\nJon leads Sam to \nthe Wall\n, but Sam balks at climbing the great wooden stairs. Jon replies that there is a winch, but\nSam states he does not like heights. When Jon asks why a boy who is afraid of everything would join the Night’s\nWatch, Sam starts to cry until Ghost licks his face, which makes them both laugh. They continue talking and before\nlong Jon starts talking about \nWinterfell\n. Jon reveals a dream he’s been having of returning to Winterfell to find it\ncompletely empty. As he is telling about the dream, Jon thinks about how several rangings have been made to find\nBenjen Stark\n, whose trail just disappears. In his dream, Jon always finds himself descending the stairs to the crypt in\ndark, and it is then that he wakes up.\nJon asks if Sam ever dreams of \nHorn Hill\n. Sam insists that he does not, and that he hated it there. After a long\nsilence, Sam tells the story of why he was sent to the Wall. His father, Lord \nRandyll Tarly\n, was disgusted that his\neldest son was so plump, soft, awkward, and squeamish. Sam’s interest in music, books, dancing, and soft clothes\nonly made matters worse. Many masters-at-arms were brought to Horn Hill to try to make Sam into the type\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>PERSON<|>A new recruit at the Night's Watch who is ridiculed for his appearance and cowardice but later befriends Jon Snow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON SNOW<|>PERSON<|>A recruit at the Night's Watch who defends Samwell Tarly and becomes his friend)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYP<|>PERSON<|>A recruit at the Night's Watch who initially mocks Sam but later helps Jon defend him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRENN<|>PERSON<|>A recruit at the Night's Watch who assists Jon in defending Sam and later expresses concern about associating with a coward)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALDER<|>PERSON<|>A strong recruit at the Night's Watch who is ordered to fight Sam and later Jon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAST<|>PERSON<|>A recruit at the Night's Watch who is sent to fight Jon and his friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBETT<|>PERSON<|>A recruit at the Night's Watch who yields during the fight with Jon and his friends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLISER THORNE<|>PERSON<|>A harsh instructor at the Night's Watch who ridicules Sam and orders his beating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGHGARDEN<|>GEO<|>A location near where Samwell Tarly is from, identified by Pyp)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE WALL<|>GEO<|>A massive fortification defended by the Night's Watch, where the recruits train)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>A character whose statement about truth influences Jon's thoughts on Sam's courage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOST<|>PERSON<|>Jon Snow's direwolf, which helps comfort Sam)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A military order that defends the Wall and trains recruits like Jon and Sam)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The ancestral home of the Stark family, which Jon dreams about)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENJEN STARK<|>PERSON<|>Jon's uncle, whose disappearance is a concern for Jon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HORN HILL<|>GEO<|>The home of Samwell Tarly, where he was sent to the Wall by his father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANDYLL TARLY<|>PERSON<|>Samwell Tarly's father, who sent him to the Night's Watch due to his perceived weaknesses)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>Jon defends Sam from being beaten and later befriends him<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYP<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>Pyp initially mocks Sam but later helps Jon defend him<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRENN<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>Grenn assists Jon in defending Sam and later expresses concern about associating with him<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HALDER<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>Halder is ordered to fight Sam and later Jon<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLISER THORNE<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>Alliser Thorne ridicules Sam and orders his beating<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Jon is a recruit training at the Night's Watch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Sam is a new recruit at the Night's Watch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>WINTERFELL<|>Jon dreams about returning to Winterfell<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>HORN HILL<|>Sam was sent to the Wall from Horn Hill by his father<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMWELL TARLY<|>RANDYLL TARLY<|>Randyll Tarly is Sam's father who sent him to the Night's Watch<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
