He feasted and wenched and fought in battles, only taking the black\nafter losing an arm during the siege of \nPyke\n.\nJon claims that the others hate him because he is better than them, but Noye insists that they hate him because he\nthinks\n he is better. Noye then calls Jon a bastard and a bully. Being called a bully surprises Jon because his attackers\nwere all older and bigger than him. Noye explains that Jon has humiliated and shamed the other recruits, who have\nhad no formal training in swordsmanship whereas Jon was trained by an anointed knight. Jon starts to feel ashamed\nbut is still angry. Noye tells him to accept his life on the Wall and reconsider how he treats his companions, or else\nto sleep with a dagger by his bed.\nAs he leaves, Jon looks up at the Wall, a massive blue-white cliff of ice that fills up half the sky and dwarfs Castle\nBlack beneath it. The Wall is the largest structure built by men according to Benjen and the most useless according\nto Tyrion. Older than the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, to Jon the Wall seems to represent the edge of the world.\n\nTyrion interrupts Jon’s look up at the Wall by commenting that it makes you wonder about what lies beyond. Since\narriving, Jon has seen little of Tyrion, who has been an honored guest among the high officers. When Tyrion asks\nJon if he is curious about what lies \nbeyond the Wall\n, Jon replies that there is nothing special but inside wishes he\ncould have ridden with his uncle Benjen on a ranging. When Tyrion calls him “Lord Snow” by mistake, Jon objects\nbut Tyrion asks him if he would prefer to be called “the Imp\" and reminds Jon to make his weakness his strength by\naccepting it.\nTyrion asks about Ghost, and Jon tells him that he chains the \ndirewolf\n in the old stables during training but that the\nrest of the time he stays with Jon in his sleeping area in Harden’s Tower. Tyrion says he thought those buildings\nwere abandoned but Jon explains that, since most of the undermanned castle is abandoned, nobody cares where a\nperson sleeps. He continues on to tell Tyrion that he sleeps alone because the others are afraid of Ghost. Tyrion\ndeclares the others wise, then mentions that Benjen Stark is late returning from his ranging. Jon recalls that his uncle\nwas supposed to be back by his name day, which is now a fortnight past. Tyrion says that he has heard that a great\nnumber of rangers have disappeared recently.\nIn the Common Hall, Jon gets food and chooses a spot away from the other recruits and Tyrion sits opposite him.\nSer Alliser interrupts Jon’s conversation to tell him that the \nLord Commander\n wants to speak with him about a\nmessage concerning his half-brother. Tyrion suspects the worst and gives Jon his sympathy. Jon races to the\nCommander’s Keep where Lord Commander \nJeor Mormont\n gives him a message from \nRobb\n at \nWinterfell\n. The\nmessage explains that \nBran\n has woken up, but is now a paraplegic.\nJon, overjoyed that Bran will live, rushes back to tell Tyrion. In his joy, Jon also apologizes to Grenn and offers to\nshow him how to defend against the move that injured him. Ser Alliser sarcastically remarks that he would have an\neasier time teaching a wolf to juggle than training Grenn to fight. Jon replies that he will take the wager as he would\nlove to see Ghost juggle. All the men in the hall, including Grenn, begin to laugh. As Ser Alliser clenches his fist in\nanger, Jon realizes that he has made himself a life-long enemy.\nNavigation:\nJon II\n↑\nCatelyn III\n ←\nJon III\n→ \nEddard IV\n↓\nJon IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 20: Eddard IV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard III\n↑\nJon III\n ←\nEddard IV\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nEddard V\nImmediately upon his arrival in \nKing's Landing\n, \nNed\n is summoned to a meeting of the \nsmall council\n to plan a\ntournament\n.
