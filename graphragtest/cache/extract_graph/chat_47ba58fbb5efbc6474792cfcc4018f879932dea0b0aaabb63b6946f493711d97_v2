He is \nhis father\n’s son and \nRobb\n's brother.\nMaester \nAemon\n was right about the pain of choosing, but \nTyrion Lannister\n was also right about denying a hard\ntruth. Jon is done with denying the truth. For the rest of his life, he will be accursed and outcast but it will be worth\nit so long as he lives long enough to join Robb in avenging their father. Jon even envisions the moment he will\nreveal himself to Robb. Yet those visions stall at Robb’s reaction, when Jon cannot picture his brother smiling. Jon’s\nmind flashes to the deserter that their father beheaded and to what his father told the deserter about vows. He\nwonders what his father’s reaction might have been if that deserter had been his brother \nBenjen\n; he thinks it must be\ndifferent. The thought of being rejected and executed does not bear thinking about, so Jon begins riding harder\nagain, as if to outrun his doubts. He does not fear death, but he does not want to die like that. He is not a true Stark\nbut he can die like one; let them say there were four sons.\nAs Jon approaches the lights of \nMole's Town\n, \nGhost\n disappears, apparently to go hunting. Jon does not concern\nhimself, knowing the \ndirewolf\n will follow at his own pace. Once he is well beyond the village, Jon stops to drink\n\nrunoff from the snow and finds his fingers ache worse than they have in days and he has a pounding headache. Since\nhis horse is lathered, he walks. Jon still has not seen his wolf and it concerns him. He decides to eat a sparse meal to\ngive Ghost a chance to catch up. As he is finishing, Jon hears horses coming from the north. Knowing they are too\nclose to outrun, Jon quickly takes cover with the horse in a grove of \nsentinel\n trees off the road.\nAs the riders ride up, Jon quickly recognizes the voices of the boys of his former training syndicate: \nGrenn\n, \nPyp\n,\nToad\n, \nHalder\n, and \nMatthar\n. Jon’s mare snorts, and Halder hears it as the others argue about where Jon might be, and\nasks the others to be quiet. Jon realizes that Sam did not go to the Lord Commander but he did not go to sleep,\neither. Jon is concerned that the other boys will be named deserters if they are not in their beds by dawn. Just as the\nboys are about to pass him by, Ghost comes loping through the woods and spooks Jon’s horse, giving away his\nposition.\nJon first tries to flee but the boys are on him before he can. He draws his sword and attempts to frighten them into\nbacking down, but the boys are unafraid. Jon demands to know what they want and they explain they are here to\ntake him back where he belongs. Jon insists that he belongs with his brother Robb, but the others remind him that\nthey\n are his brothers now. Jon wonders why they cannot leave him in peace. They start reciting their vows, Jon\ncursing them. Pyp moves his horse closer, and the others surround him. Pyp grabs the reins and tells Jon that he\nmust either come back with them or kill them. Jon knows can easily kill them all, but agrees to go back, cursing\nthem all. Ghost comes out of the trees and Jon glares at him, but Ghost’s eyes seem to have a knowing look. Pyp\nnotes that they have to hurry because they must be back before first light, otherwise the Lord Commander will have\nall their heads. They make it back an hour before dawn. To Jon it no longer seems like home and he decides he will\nbide his time before his next attempt and avoid the kingsroad next time.\nThe next morning as Jon is serving his breakfast, the Lord Commander reminds Jon of his comment that the things\nmen love destroy them and that the hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Then he comments that Jon looks weary\nand asks if his moonlight ride was exhausting. When Jon expresses his surprise, Mormont explains that Maester\nAemon told him that Jon would leave, and that he told Aemon that Jon would come back. He adds that he knew\nhonor would bring Jon back. Jon points out that his friends brought him back, but Mormont replies that he did not\nsay it was Jon’s honor. He then tells Jon that he had a watch put over him, and that if his friends had not brought him\nback, he would have been taken anyway.\nJon thinks his life is forfeit and declares he is not afraid to die. Mormont says he hopes Jon is not afraid to live\neither, pointing out that if they beheaded every man who rode to Mole’s Town for the night only ghosts would guard\nthe Wall. Mormont also notes that Jon is plotting to desert again. When Jon keeps silent, Mormont asks if he thinks\nhe can actually bring his father back to life or make any difference to Robb’s war; each of Robb’s bannermen\ncommand more swords than the entire Night’s Watch.\nMormont goes so far as to point out that his own sister, \nMaege\n, and her daughters rode south with Robb, but that his\nplace is the Wall. Mormont asks where Jon believes his place is. Jon thinks that he has no place, no mother, and now\nno father, but only says he does not know.
