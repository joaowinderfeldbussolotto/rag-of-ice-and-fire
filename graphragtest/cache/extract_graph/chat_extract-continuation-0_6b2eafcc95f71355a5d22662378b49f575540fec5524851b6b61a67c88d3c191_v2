Queen Cersei expresses displeasure, but Varys\nonly claims that she is a child who does not understand what she says. Joffrey tells the others to let her speak.\nThe small council questions her about her father’s treason, and Sansa knows better than to deny it. Instead she tells\nthem that others must have lied to her father, and that he only claimed Joffrey was not the king because of the pain\nfrom his broken leg and the effects of the \nmilk of the poppy\n. Joffrey calls for his mother, who states that if Lord\nEddard confesses his crime, then they will know he has repented. Sansa prays that her Joffrey be as kind and noble\nas she believes he is. Joffrey agrees that if Eddard admits his guilt and swears fealty he will be granted mercy. Sansa\nassures them that he will.\nNavigation:\nSansa IV\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nSansa V\n→ \nEddard XV\n↓\nSansa VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 58: Eddard XV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard XIV\n↑\nSansa V\n ←\nEddard XV\n→ \nCatelyn IX\nNed\n is visited in the \nblack cells\n by \nVarys\n, who brings him news. He urges Ned to admit to treason, command \nRobb\nto lay down his sword, and denounce \nStannis\n and \nRenly\n. When Eddard states that his life is not worth forsaking his\nhonor, Varys tells him that Cersei has \nSansa\n, whose life is also at stake.\nSynopsis\nNed\n’s cell contains nothing but straw that stinks of urine. There are no windows, so the darkness is absolute. Ned\nthinks back to \nRobert\n’s words, “The king eats and the \nHand\n takes the shit,” and thinks, “The king dies, and the Hand\nis buried.” The cell is deeper under the \nRed Keep\n than Ned dares imagine. He remembers the story of \nMaegor the\nCruel\n murdering the masons to keep the castle’s secrets. He also remembers \nCersei\n’s words, “When you play the\ngame of thrones, you win or you die,” and he knows that he has played and lost. He wants to weep, but he is still a\nStark\n of \nWinterfell\n and his grief and rage freeze inside him.\nAs his injured leg throbs, Ned damns them all, but can only blame himself; he was a fool. To keep himself sane, he\nthinks and plans aloud. \nStannis\n and \nRenly\n \nBaratheon\n are likely gathering armies at \nDragonstone\n and \nStorm's End\n.\nCatelyn\n will raise \nthe North\n and the armies of \nRiver\n and \nVale\n will join her.\nAs time drags on, Ned finds himself thinking more and more of Robert Baratheon as he was in the flower of his\nyouth. In the darkness of his cell he can hear Robert ask him, “Gods, how are we come to this? You here, and me\nkilled by a pig.” Ned broods on how he failed Robert by hiding the truth and letting them kill him. When Ned is half\nasleep, a jailer arrives with water, which he drinks eagerly. He asks the jailer for news but is ignored.\nAs his solitude grows, Ned vividly remembers when he was eighteen at the \nTourney at Harrenhal\n. He remembers\nBrandon\n’s laughter, Robert’s valor in the melee, \nJaime Lannister\n joining the \nKingsguard\n, and \nRhaegar Targaryen\ndefeating Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n in the final joust. Then Ned remembers the moment when all the smiles died, as\nRhaegar rode past \nhis own wife\n to lay the queen of beauty’s laurel in \nLyanna\n’s lap. It was a crown of winter roses,\nwhich Lyanna loved the scent of. In his delirium, Eddard grasps the laurel, but there are thorns underneath and blood\ntrickles down his fingers. Then he remembers his promise to Lyanna again, and weeps that he is going mad.\nThe jailer continues to come with a jug of water each day, but no food, and eventually Ned no longer asks questions.\nHe is sure that Cersei will not kill him as long as Catelyn holds \nthe Imp\n.\nA new jailer arrives with wine instead of water. The voice that tells him to drink is familiar; it is \nVarys\n in a very\neffective \ndisguise\n. Varys tells him that \nArya\n escaped (which is for the best since Joffrey has no love for her), and\nthat \nSansa\n is still betrothed to Joffrey and kept close by the queen. Sansa \npleaded\n for his life in court a few days\nprevious. Ned reminds Varys that Cersei will not kill him because Catelyn holds her brother. Varys replies that\nTyrion is the wrong brother. Besides, Catelyn has let Tyrion escape and he is probably now dead in the \nMountains\nof the Moon\n.\nNed accuses Varys of standing by while his guards were slaughtered; Varys makes no apologies since he was\nunarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister soldiers.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUEEN
