After the squires run out,\nRobert and Ser Barristan laugh and even Ned smiles at the thought of the boys asking for the non-existent device.\nNed asks if the two squires are from \nHouse Lannister\n. The king admits they are, and Ned notes to himself that there\nare too many Lannisters around the king. Putting the thought aside, Ned asks about the angry words between the\nking and his wife. Robert takes this opportunity to complain about \nCersei\n’s audacity in telling him he should not\nparticipate in the melee, and he claims \nLyanna Stark\n would not have done such a thing. Ned insists Robert did not\nreally know Lyanna, and that she would have told him he had no business fighting in the melee. This does not\ndissuade Robert, who insists that—unlike Ned—he still has juices running in his veins. When Ser Barristan speaks\nup to explain that no man would dare to strike a king during the melee, Robert is furious and sends Ser Barristan\naway, but orders Ned to stay and to drink.\nRobert laments to Ned that he was never so alive as when he was winning the throne or so dead as after it was won.\nHe declares that Ned or Jon Arryn should have been the king, but Ned reminds Robert that he had the best claim.\nThe king declares that he had not wanted to marry after Lyanna’s death and that it was \nJon Arryn\n who recommended\nCersei Lannister. Robert admits that Cersei is beautiful, but insists that she is cold and that Jon Arryn was a fool for\nrecommending the marriage; Robert only agreed to it so he'd have the wealth and might of \nTywin Lannister\n on his\nside should \nViserys Targaryen\n ever return to claim the throne.\nRobert also apologizes to Ned for the death of Sansa’s \ndirewolf\n, admitting that he is sure \nJoffrey\n lied regarding the\nincident\n. He continues that he dreams of giving up the crown and becoming a \nsellsword\n in the \nFree Cities\n, but the\n\nthought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear stops him. Robert asks Ned how he could have\nmade a son like Joffrey. Ned responds hollowly that Joffrey is only a boy and that Jon Arryn often despaired of\nRobert himself when he was a child. Robert admits this to be true and claims that he turned into a good king. When\nNed does not respond, Robert declares that Ned could at least say he is a better king than \nAerys\n. Ned admits the\ntruth in that. Robert insists that he and Ned still have many years yet to set things right and make him a good ruler.\nChanging the subject, Robert asks who Ned believes will win the joust. Robert comments that the \nKnight of Flowers\nis a son to be proud of and regales Ned with the story of when the young knight unhorsed \nJaime Lannister\n in a\nprevious tourney. Then the king mentions that \nRenly\n has told him about the Knight of Flowers’ lovely, fourteen-\nyear-old sister \nMargaery\n.\nDuring breakfast, Robert talks with Ned about when they were boys. The stories bring a smile to Ned, who realizes\nhe is speaking to the Robert he grew up with and if he can prove his accusations this man will listen. The thought of\nthe downfall of Cersei and Jaime even makes the food taste better, and Ned feels better than he has in a long time.\nNed arrives at the tourney and sits by his daughter \nSansa\n. In the first joust, \nLittlefinger\n bets against \nthe Hound\n since\na dog will not bite the hand that feeds it. He loses the bet when the Hound defeats Ser Jaime on the second pass after\nalmost losing in the first. Sansa tells Ned that she knew the Hound would win, and Littlefinger asks her to tell him\nwho will win the second match.\nBy the time they lead Ser Jaime—who can no longer see through his mangled helm—off the field, Ser \nGregor\nClegane\n is in position. He is the biggest man Ned has ever seen, even dwarfing \nHodor\n. Ned recalls Gregor as a man\nof ominous reputation; supposedly he dashed in the skull of the infant \nAegon Targaryen\n and boasted that he raped\nand murdered the boy’s mother Princess \nElia\n afterwards. There are also rumors of queer circumstances surrounding\nthe deaths of two wives, a sister, his father, and the burning of his brother’s face.\nClegane’s opponent is the slim and elegantly armored Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell, who wears a cape of\nwoven flowers. After comparing Ser Loras and his opponent, Sansa asks her father to ensure that Ser Loras is not\nhurt. Ned assures her that the lances are designed to break to prevent injury, but cannot help but think of Ser Hugh.\nSer Gregor has tremendous difficulty controlling his stallion, while Loras demonstrates his horsemanship on his\nmare. When the pass begins, Clegane’s mount breaks into a hard gallop immediately, while Ser Loras’ mare charges\nsmoothly. They meet while Gregor is still struggling with his mount, shield, and lance. Ser Loras' lance strikes\nGregor perfectly, sending him down with his mount. Ser Loras’ lance is not even\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_aba72ba79a143540a33952bfe9e581d88e66382922867ddeed00c81f7fcd0586_v2"}
