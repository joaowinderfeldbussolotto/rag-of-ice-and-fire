When he heard \nEddard Stark\nwas coming to punish him, he fled with his wife to \nLys\n. In half a year, their money was gone and he was forced to\nbecome a \nsellsword\n, and while he was away fighting, Lynesse moved in with the merchant prince \nTregar Ormollen\n.\nWhen Daenerys asks, Jorah explains that he hates Lynesse almost as much as he loves her. As Jorah is leaving,\nDaenerys asks what Lynesse looked like, and Jorah replies that she looked a lot like her.\nAfter he leaves, Daenerys realizes Ser Jorah loves her and wants her, not as a queen but as a woman. She tries to\nimage herself with him, but it is no good. She also noticed his longing to return to Bear Island. He can never have\nher, but she hopes one day to give him back his home and his honor. That night she dreams of riding dragons with\nDrogo.\nThe next morning, she calls her bloodriders and orders them each to take three healthy horses and plenty of supplies\nto go scouting: Aggo to the southwest, Rakharo to the south, and Jhogo to the southeast. While they wait for the\nbloodriders to return to the city (which they name \nVaes Tolorro\n) the \nkhalasar\n has a chance to recover, and Daenerys\ntends to Ser Jorah's hip wound, which finally starts to heal.\nRakharo returns first to report the wasteland stretches south all the way to the ocean. Daenerys puts him in charge of\npulling up the plaza so more grass might grow for the horses. Aggo returns next, having found only two deserted\ncities smaller than Vaes Tolorro. Daenerys sets him to work repairing the city gates. Jhogo is the last to return, much\nlater, bringing three queerly garbed strangers from the great city of \nQarth\n: the great warlock \nPyat Pree\n, the merchant\nprince \nXaro Xhoan Daxos\n of the \nThirteen\n, and \nQuaithe\n of the Shadow. They come seeking dragons, and Daenerys\ndeclares they have found them.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys X\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nTheon I\n ←\nDaenerys I\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nDaenerys II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 13: Jon II\nPlace(s): \nWhitetree\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon I\n↑\nDaenerys I\n ←\nJon II\n→ \nArya IV\n↓\nJon III\nJon Snow\n helps investigate \nWhitetree\n, the fourth abandoned \nwildling\n village they have encountered. \nLord\nCommander\n \nJeor Mormont\n dispatches Jon with a report for \nSamwell Tarly\n to send back to \nCastle Black\n. After a\nshort talk with Sam, Jon returns to Mormont to discuss how \nhis uncle\n might have reacted to the abandoned villages.\nSynopsis\nThe abandoned village of \nWhitetree\n is dominated by the largest tree \nJon Snow\n has ever seen. The \nweirwood\n shades\nthe entire village beneath its canopy, but the size does not disturb Jon as much as the face, whose jagged mouth is\nlarge enough to swallow a sheep and contains human bones. \nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n notes that the tree is old,\nand Jon adds that it is powerful as well.\nThoren Smallwood\n declares he now understands why the men feared the \nheart trees\n when they first came to\nWesteros\n and cut them down. Jon replies that \nhis father\n claimed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree, and\nMormont agrees his father said the same. Mormont asks Jon to retrieve the blackened skull from the ashes. When he\nreaches in, Jon finds another skull under it. As he examines the skull, Mormont wishes he had asked why the\nwildlings burn their dead when there were still a few around to ask. Jon remembers the \nwight\n he fought and is\ncertain he knows the reason.\nMusing on what they might learn if bones could talk, Mormont orders the houses searched. Jon is paired with\nEddison Tollett\n, nicknamed Dolorous Edd. As they search, Dolorous Edd says the dead walking is bad enough, but\nnow Mormont wants them talking, too. The grey-haired squire adds that the dead might lie, or be full of tedious\ncomplaints. Entering one of the houses, Jon notes the dirt floor and lack of furnishing and calls it is a dismal place to\nlive. Dolorous Edd replies that he was born in such a house, but then fell on hard times.\nThey find nothing, as expected. Whitetree is the fourth village they have searched and each has been as empty.\nWhen Jon asks what he thinks happened here, Dolorous Edd responds he does not want to imagine. Reemerging,\nthey find \nChett\n using the hounds to search and cursing angrily. When Jon meets Chett's eyes, he can tell there is no\nlove lost between them. Thoren Smallwood, dressed in the late Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n's armor and cloak and looking\nmore lordly than Mormont, declares there were wildlings here a year ago. \nJarman Buckwell\n
