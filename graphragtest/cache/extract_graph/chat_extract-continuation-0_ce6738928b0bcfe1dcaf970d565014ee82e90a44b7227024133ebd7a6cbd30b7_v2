Jojen reveals to Bran that he had a green dream in which\nReek is skinning off Bran's face.\nSynopsis\nBran\n is found working the bellows for \nMikken\n by \nAlebelly\n to tell him that there has been a bird from \nRobb Stark\n.\nBran lets Alebelly carry him to Maester \nLuwin\n's turret where \nRickon\n already waits. The maester informs them that\nRobb shattered a \nLannister\n army at the \nBattle of Oxcross\n, killing its commander Ser \nStafford Lannister\n. He has also\ncaptured several castles, and is currently at \nAshemark\n, the stronghold of \nHouse Marbrand\n. Rickon asks if Robb is\ncoming home, but Bran knows that only Lord \nTywin Lannister\n matters, as \nBig Walder\n states, which disquiets him.\nNeither Big Walder nor \nLittle Walder\n seem upset about their uncle Ser \nStevron Frey\n's death, who, they note, was\nvery old (50 or 60) and always tired. Little Walder asks if Ser \nEmmon Frey\n is now heir, and his cousin tells him the\nline of ascension: Ser \nRyman\n, \nEdwyn\n, \nBlack Walder\n, \nPetyr\n, then \nAegon Frey\n and his sons. Little Walder states theat\nRyman is too old, and then asks if they think he will be lord, and Big Walder responds he will be lord and does not\ncare. The maester tells them that they should be ashamed.\nOsha\n arrives to carry him; she is stronger than Alebelly. Bran asks if she knows the way north, and she tells him it is\neasy. He then asks if the \nchildren of the forest\n, the \nOthers\n and \ngiants\n are still there and she tells him she has seen\ngiants and heard of the others. He then asks about the \nthree-eyed crow\n, which she has never heard of. She sets him\non the window seat of his bedchamber.\nShortly thereafter, \nJojen\n enters the room unbidden with \nMeera\n behind him. Bran asks Jojen if he has heard about the\nbird; he states it was not supper, it was a letter from Robb. Jojen explains that the \ngreen dreams\n are not easy to\nunderstand. When Bran asks Jojen to tell him his dream, Jojen reveals that he dreamed the sea was lapping all\naround Winterfell. Waves crashed against the gates and towers, and the water came flowing over the walls and filled\nthe castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard. He now recognizes these men and declares that they are Alebelly,\nSepton \nChayle\n, and \nMikken\n. Bran, confused and dismayed, replies that the sea is hundreds of leagues away, and\nWinterfell's walls are so high the water could not get in even if it did come. Jojen only repeats his claim, adding that\nhe saw the dead, bloated and drowned.\nBran wants to warn the men, but Jojen tells him it will not save them, as they will not believe him. He then asks\nBran to tell of his wolf dream, and Bran replies that there are different kinds. There are the wolf dreams, which are\nnot as bad as the others, in which he runs, hunts and kills squirrels. He has other dreams where the crow comes and\ntells him to fly. Sometimes the tree is also calling his name in those dreams, which frightens him, but not as much as\nwhen he falls. He explains that he never used to fall while climbing, and that he used to feed the crows in the Burned\nTower. Yet, he did fall eventually, and now when he sleeps he falls all the time.\nJojen tells Bran that he will be called a \nwarg\n if others hear of his wolf dreams, and some will hate him in fear, as the\npower is strong in him. Bran is concerned since in \nOld Nan\n's stories wargs were always evil, and tells Jojen that he\n\nwants to be a \nknight\n. Jojen replies that he is a winged wolf but will never fly unless he opens the eye in his forehead,\nand he must search for it with his heart. When Bran states that Maester Luwin claims dreams are just that, Jojen\nresponds they are the past, the future, and truth. With that they leave him, and Bran tries unsuccessfully to open his\nthird eye.\nOn the following days, Bran tries to warn his household, but no one seems to believe him. Mikken thinks it funny,\nand states he always wanted to see the sea. Septon Chayle states the gods will take him when they do, and he does\nnot think he will drown since he grew up on the banks of the \nWhite Knife\n. Alebelly takes heed, and refuses to bathe\nor go near a well until finally other guardsmen give him a bath because he stinks so badly.\nSer \nRodrik Cassel\n returns with a man that \nHayhead\n tells Bran is named \nReek\n. He served the now-dead \nRamsay\nSnow\n (the Bastard of Bolton). The bastard and Reek murdered Lady \nHornwood\n. Rodrik’s men shot Snow as he\nattempted to ride away. He had forced Lady Hornwood to marry him and then to sign a will naming him heir.
