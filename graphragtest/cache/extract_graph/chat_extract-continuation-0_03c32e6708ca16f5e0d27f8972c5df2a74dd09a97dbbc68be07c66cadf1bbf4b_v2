Many of his\nother bannermen who were captured during \nthe Battle\n bent the knee to King \nJoffrey\n. He also learns that Lord\nGuncer Sunglass\n was sacrificed to the fire by \nMelisandre\n as an offering to \nR'hllor\n. \nSalladhor\n tells Davos that Lord\nAlester\n is now \nHand of the King\n, but Stannis remains in the \nStone Drum\n and sees no one but Melisandre.\nDavos plans to kill Melisandre because he blames her for the defeat and the death of his sons.

The boy greatly\nresembles \nRobert\n and \nRenly\n, and he reveres his father. Edric says that his uncle Stannis should never have chopped\noff Davos’s fingers, but the Onion Knight knows that Robert was a different man than Stannis.

The innkeep recommends they\nabandon their skiff and ride for \nKing's Landing\n. Brienne buys the inn's horses for three gold and their skiff, getting\nrobbed blind according to Jaime. The \nhusband\n of the innkeeper recommends they follow a specific path to avoid\noutlaws, and they ride off. Jaime is impressed that Brienne takes the opposite path, realizing they might have been\nset up.\nThat night, Jaime reminisces of how he became a \nKingsguard\n. \nHis sister\n was brought to court by \nTywin\n, who was\nHand\n at the time. He hoped to wed her to prince \nViserys\n. Jaime was squiring for \nSumner Crakehall\n, and was\nknighted by \nArthur Dayne\n during the battle against the \nKingswood Brotherhood\n. Cersei later informed him that their\nfather meant to wed him to \nLysa Arryn\n, and she told him that if he took the white cloak, they could be together in\nKing's Landing. They did it behind their father's back, and Tywin could not object to King \nAerys\n' wishes. Tywin\nthen resigned as Hand and took Cersei back to \nCasterly Rock\n, unknowingly ruining their plan, for Jaime was now\nstuck in King's Landing as a sworn brother of the Kingsguard.\nYears later, when Aerys made the mistake of admitting Tywin's army, the Mad King called for the former Hand's\nhead. Alone in the throne room, Aerys had one final plan, but Jaime arrived in his golden armor, the blood of Lord\nRossart\n on his blade, and killed the King. Jaime had hoped to slip out unnoticed, but his father's men entered the\nthrone room, and they thought Jaime meant to give the throne to his father, but Jaime told them he didn't care who\nwas proclaimed king.
