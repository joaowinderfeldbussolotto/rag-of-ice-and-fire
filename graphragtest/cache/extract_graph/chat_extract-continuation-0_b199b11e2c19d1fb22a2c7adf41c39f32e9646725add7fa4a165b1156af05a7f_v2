Joffrey angrily refuses,\nstating that getting unhorsed is not riding well. However, Tommen shows courage when he prepares to try again.\nSansa finds herself wishing that Tommen was the eldest child; she wouldn’t mind marrying him.\nJust then, the portcullis rises and the gates of the Red Keep open. A column of dusty horsemen enter under the\ngolden lion banner of House Lannister. Some of the horsemen wear the armor of Lannister men-at-arms but the\nmajority are freeriders, sellswords, and \nmonstrous savages\n. In their midst rides \nTyrion Lannister\n, the ugliest man\nSansa has ever set eyes upon. Tommen and Myrcella rush to greet their uncle and Sansa is stunned to see that\nTommen and Tyrion are the same height.\nAfter greeting his niece and nephew, the dwarf waddles over to Joffrey, shadowed by a \nblack-haired sellsword\n and a\none-eyed savage\n. When Tyrion greets him, Joffrey expresses surprise at Tyrion’s arrival and the Hound comments\nthat they heard Tyrion was dead. Myrcella expresses happiness that he is alive. Tyrion thanks her and then gives his\ncondolences to Joffrey and Sansa for the loss of their fathers. Sansa is speechless, wondering if Tyrion is mocking\nher. Joffrey is momentarily confused until Tyrion reminds him that his own father, King Robert, has also recently\ndied. Joffrey responds “Oh, him. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.” Tyrion asks him if that is what ‘they’ say.\n\nSansa, armoring herself in courtesy, apologizes to Tyrion for his \nabduction\n by her mother. Tyrion thanks Sansa for\nthe sentiment, telling her that many people are sorry, and some will be even sorrier.\nThen, Tyrion asks Joffrey where he might find Queen Cersei. Joffrey answers that she is with the small council;\nJaime Lannister\n keeps losing battles and was captured, \nRiverrun\n was lost, and Robb is calling himself king. Tyrion\ncomments that all sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days. Suspicious of the comment, Joffrey tells\nTyrion stiffly that he is happy he is alive, and asks about a gift for his name day. Tyrion responds that he has brought\nhis wits, and Joffrey replies he would prefer Robb’s head. Before Joffrey departs with Myrcella and Tommen, the\nHound tells Tyrion to guard his tongue. Sansa is left alone with Tyrion and his monsters.\nUnable to think of anything else to say, Sansa comments on Tyrion's injured arm. Tyrion tells her that a northman\nhit him with a morning star, but he escaped by falling off his horse. Tyrion asks if it is mourning for her father that\nmakes Sansa so sad. Sansa reflexively insists that her father, mother, and brother are traitors and that she is loyal to\nher beloved Joffrey. Tyrion is unconvinced and responds by comparing her to a deer surrounded by wolves. Sansa,\nwithout thinking, whispers “Lions.” The dwarf gently takes her hand and assures her that he is only a little lion and\nmeans her no harm, then departs.\nSansa notes that Tyrion speaks to her more gently than Joffrey, but then she remembers that Queen Cersei once\nspoke gently as well. She reminds herself that Tyrion is still a Lannister and that she must never trust a Lannister\nagain.\nNavigation:\nSansa VI\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nArya I\n ←\nSansa I\n→ \nTyrion I\n↓\nSansa II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 3: Tyrion I\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n - The \nRed Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion IX\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nSansa I\n ←\nTyrion I\n→ \nBran 1\n↓\nTyrion II\nTyrion Lannister\n meets with the \nsmall council\n and assumes his position as acting \nHand of the King\n.

Later, Tyrion travels to the \nBroken Anvil\n, where he has finds \nVarys\n has already discovered his mistress \nShae\n.\nSynopsis\nOutside the \nsmall council\n chamber, Ser \nMandon Moore\n insists that Queen \nCersei\n has left orders not to be disturbed.\nTyrion\n quips that he will only be a small disturbance and produces his letter from Lord \nTywin Lannister\n. Ser\nMandon remains unimpressed and expressionless, a trait which makes \nJaime Lannister\n consider him the most\ndangerous of the \nKingsguard\n (besides himself), since his face never hints at his next action.
