Then she asks to see Drogo.\nDrogo lies unmoving, unseeing, and covered in \nbloodflies\n. Daenerys asks why he is outside alone and Ser Jorah\nexplains that he seems to like the warmth and staring at the sun with eyes that cannot see. He will follow where led\nand eat if food is put in his mouth, but otherwise does nothing. Daenerys faces Mirri Maz Duur, who insists that\nDrogo \nis\n alive. Daenerys responds that such is not life for a man that was as alive as Drogo. Then Daenerys asks\nMirri Maz Duur when Drogo will be as he was. The \nmaegi\n replies,\n“When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like\nleaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.”\nDaenerys sends the others away and then accuses Mirri Maz Duur of knowing, of cheating her and murdering her\nchild. Mirri Maz Duur replies that it was wrong of the \nkhalasar\n to burn her temple, and now the \nStallion Who\nMounts the World\n will burn no cities and trample no nations. Daenerys reminds the \nmaegi\n that she saved her, but\nMirri Maz Duur asks what Daenerys saved when three warriors had already raped her, burned her home and her\ntemple, and cut off the heads of her neighbors and friends. Daenerys insists that she saved her life, but the \nmaegi\ntells her to look at her \nkhal\n and see what life is worth when all else is gone. Daenerys orders her men to bind Mirri\nMaz Duur and take her away; the woman only smiles at her.\nDaenerys orders Drogo brought into her tent. She bathes him herself and washes his hair until darkness falls. She\nthinks of their first ride beneath the open sky and of when they made \nRhaego\n. She is too raw from the miscarriage\nfor intercourse, but uses other means in an attempt to use the magic of love to bring Drogo back. It does not work\nand her husband remains comatose. When dawn breaks, Daenerys kisses Drogo for the last time, and then smothers\nhim with a soft silk pillow.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys VIII\n↑\nSansa VI\n ←\nDaenerys IX\n→ \nTyrion IX\n↓\nDaenerys X\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 69: Tyrion IX\nPlace(s): \nCrossroads Inn\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VIII\n↑\nDaenerys IX\n ←\nTyrion IX\n→ \nJon IX\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nTyrion I\nNews of \nRobb Stark\n’s \nvictory\n at \nRiverrun\n prompts vigorous debate among the \nLannister\n officers. After dismissing\nthe officers, Lord \nTywin\n details their precarious position to \nTyrion\n and dispatches him to \nKing's Landing\n to serve as\nacting \nHand of the King\n and keep \nJoffrey\n from ruining them all. In spite of his father’s direct command, Tyrion\nintends to bring \nShae\n with him.\nSynopsis\nThe army has just returned to the \ninn at the crossroads\n when a messenger arrives with word of Ser \nJaime Lannister\n’s\ncapture\n and the \ndefeat\n of his army at \nRiverrun\n. Lord \nTywin\n is upset that the \nStarks\n have his son. The news makes\nTyrion\n think back on their grueling countermarch. After realizing that \nRobb Stark\n had split his forces, Lord Tywin\nset a grueling pace back toward the \nTrident\n in an attempt to reach Riverrun before the Starks. They left the bodies of\nthe weak and the wounded in their wake every day and it was all for nothing; Robb Stark has beaten them there by\nmany days.\nSer \nHarys Swyft\n bemoans Jaime’s decision to split his army into three camps, but Ser \nKevan Lannister\n explains\ncalmly that Riverrun’s position at the fork of the \nTumblestone\n and the \nRed Fork\n forces any besieger to do just that,\nplacing one army north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and one between the two rivers to the west.\nJaime’s army had no warning. Few of their outriders returned and those who did had seen nothing. The blame for\ntheir disappearance fell on a small raiding force commanded by \nMarq Piper\n and Jaime rode out personally to deal\nwith them in the Whispering Wood and did not return. Robb’s force attacked the north camp first during the night.\nThe Blackfish\n led the attack, cutting down the sentries. When Lord \nAndros Brax\n saw that the northern camp was\nunder attack, he led the men of the western camp across the Tumblestone in rafts to join the battle. However, the\ncurrent pushed them downstream into range of the catapults of Riverrun. Many of the rafts were sunk or overturned\nand Lord Brax was drowned by his heavy plate armor. Those few who reached the far bank found the enemy waiting\nfor them.
