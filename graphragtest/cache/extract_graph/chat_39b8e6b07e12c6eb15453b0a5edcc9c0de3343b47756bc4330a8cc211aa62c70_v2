She insists that her father is dying and her brother is\nsurrounded by foes; her place is with them at Riverrun.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VII\n↑\nDaenerys VI\n ←\nCatelyn VIII\n→ \nTyrion VII\n↓\nCatelyn IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 56: Tyrion VII\nPlace(s): \ninn at the crossroads\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VI\n↑\nCatelyn VIII\n ←\nTyrion VII\n→ \nSansa V\n↓\nTyrion VIII\nTyrion\n meets \nhis father’s\n army at the \ninn at the crossroads\n, escorted by 300 \nVale mountain clansmen\n. Tyrion and\nLord Tywin are discussing their war plans when Tyrion’s clansmen burst in, but Tywin handles them coolly. When\nnews arrives that \nRobb Stark\n’s host is advancing, Tywin offers rich rewards to the clansmen if they fight for him.\nSynopsis\nChella\n of the \nBlack Ears\n is the one who locates \nLord Tywin\n’s army, which she deduces to be 20,000 men. \nTyrion\nhas gathered a force of over 300 \nmountain clansmen\n and \nGunthor son of Gurn\n is collecting more. He wonders what\nhis father will make of his little army, since he is not sure what to make of them himself.\nTyrion wants to meet his father without the clansmen, but \nUlf son of Umar\n expresses distrust and \nShagga\n insists that\nhe will go with the “boyman,” and if he lies Tyrion will lose his manhood. Tyrion is forced to quickly give in to the\ndemands of his captor-followers (he’s still not sure which they are) and selects representatives from each clan to\naccompany him. As a parting jibe, he asks the remaining clansmen to try not to kill each other while he is gone.\nTyrion dislikes having to work with the clans because they think everyone’s voice should be heard in council, which\ncauses them to argue endlessly.\nWhen they come to the first strongpoint, which Tyrion approaches alone, the captain recognizes Tyrion and gives\nthem an escort. They travel past burned land and buildings. There are many carrion birds, although there are no\nbodies. When they arrive at the guarded camp containing hundreds of campfires, they are met by a party led by Ser\nFlement Brax\n, who is surprised to see Tyrion. He tells Tyrion that his father has taken the \ninn at the crossroads\n as his\nheadquarters, which Tyrion finds a fitting full-circle to his \nunpleasant abduction\n.\nAs they pass the many banners, Tyrion guesses that Chella’s count cannnot be far wrong. He also notes that his\nclansmen are awed, which pleases him; the more impressed they are by the power of \nHouse Lannister\n the easier they\nwill be to control. When they arrive at the inn, Tyrion is pleased to see the body of the innkeepter \nMasha Heddle\nrotting in a gibbet. When the stableboys emerge hesitantly to take their horses, Shagga is suspicious but Tyrion is\nable to convince him. House guards at the door direct Tyrion to his father in the common room.\nLord Tywin Lannister is sharing ale with his brother, Ser \nKevan Lannister\n. Kevan sees Tyrion first and expresses\nsurprise, but Tywin only remarks that the rumors of his demise were unfounded. Tyrion tells his father that he is\nsorry to disappoint him, feeling uncomfortable with his deformities under his father’s gaze. He quickly covers his\ndiscomfort with a quip that he is thankful they started a war for his sake. His father takes the opportunity to chastise\nTyrion for going meekly with \na woman\n; his brother \nJaime\n would not have gone without a fight. Tyrion replies that\nJaime is also taller.\nLord Tywin then explains that Lannister honor demanded they go to war after Tyrion was captured. Tyrion asks\nthem how that \nwar\n is going. His father explains that Jaime has been covering himself in glory, \nsmashing\n the forces\nof Lords \nPiper\n and \nVance\n at the \nGolden Tooth\n and pushing on to \ndefeat\n the main \nTully\n forces outside \nRiverrun\n and\ncapture \nEdmure Tully\n. Lord \nBlackwood\n has fallen back to hold Riverrun against Jaime, but the other \nriver lords\nhave dispersed to their own lands. Many of these lords have now fallen one by one to Lord Tywin’s army, leaving\nonly the \nFreys\n and \nMallisters\n to oppose them. Lord Tywin in not concerned; he knows that \nWalder Frey\n will not\n\nbestir himself until the winner is clear and \nJason Mallister\n lacks the strength to stand alone. The only real threat is\nthat the \nStarks\n or \nArryns\n will interfere.\nTyrion tells them they need not worry about the Arryns, but the Starks are another matter. He is informed of \nEddard\nStark\n’s arrest and that \nRobb Stark\n has called the Stark banners. Tywin remains unperturbed, declaring that Robb is\nonly a child.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_39b8e6b07e12c6eb15453b0a5edcc9c0de3343b47756bc4330a8cc211aa62c70_v2"}
