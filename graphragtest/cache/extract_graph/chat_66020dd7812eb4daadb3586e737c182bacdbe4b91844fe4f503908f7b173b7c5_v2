Jaqen, who claims his name is as dead as Arry, then disappears into the night.\nLord Roose Bolton arrives in the aftermath of the \nfall of Harrenhal\n, and Vargo Hoat turns the castle over to him. The\nprisoners were all a ruse to begin with, and apparently Bolton had bought the services of the Qohorik sellsword. As\nRoose Bolton takes control of the castle, \nShagwell\n grabs Arya and presents her to her brother \nRobb's\n bannerman as\nthe weasel who made the soup. Bolton asks her name, and Arya tells him ‘Nan’. The Lord of the \nDreadfort\n then asks\nif she is afraid of leeches, for he claims that a man must purge himself of bad blood. When Arya tells him she is not\nafraid, Bolton names her his cupbearer. The banners over the gatehouse are changed to the flayed man of the\nDreadfort and the direwolf of the \nStarks\n. Arya watches as the Bloody Mummers parade Ser Amory around naked,\nthen feed him to a caged bear, and she thinks to herself, a bear all in black, like \nYoren\n.\n\nNavigation:\nArya VIII\n↑\nBran VI\n ←\nArya IX\n→ \nDaenerys IV\n↓\nArya X\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 48: Daenerys IV\nPlace(s): \nQarth\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys III\n↑\nArya IX\n ←\nDaenerys IV\n→ \nTyrion XI\n↓\nDaenerys V\nDaenerys Targaryen\n enters the \nHouse of the Undying\n, where she experiences many visions. She reaches the\naudience chamber of the Undying Ones, who give her cryptic information and then try to consume her. \nDrogon\nrescues her and she runs outside, where \nPyat Pree\n tries to attack her, but Drogon comes to her help once again.\nSynopsis\nDaenerys stands before the \nHouse of the Undying\n. \nDrogon\n hisses at the gray and ancient ruin and most of her\ncompanions, Ser \nJorah\n, \nJhogo\n, \nAggo\n, and \nXaro\n, tell her she should turn back, but she is resolute to enter the abode\nof the Warlocks. \nPyat Pree\n steps out to her, saying that Daenerys must enter alone, or not at all. He leads her to the\nentrance, warning her to always take the door to her right, and only take stairs leading up. On her way she will see\nvisions of the past, future and days that never were, and those that will speak to her from other rooms, but she must\nnot enter any room and keep her path until she reaches the Undying's audience chamber.\nAt the entrance, Daenerys drinks a glass of \nshade of the evening\n a dwarf gives her, to prepare her for the truths\nwithin, and enters. In the House of the Undying, she notices right away that she is in the presence of sorcery.\nFortunately, she brought \nDrogon\n with her into the Warlocks' home. Daenerys sees a great many visions during her\njourney through the halls:\n1\n. \nA beautiful naked woman sprawling on a floor with four little men with rat-like faces raping her.\n2\n. \nA feast of corpses, a room full of savagely slaughtered bodies, and many of the corpses have cups or spoons in\ntheir hands; above them sits a dead man on a throne with the head of a wolf, wearing an iron crown and holding\na leg of lamb like a king would hold a scepter;\n3\n. \nold, dead, loyal Ser \nWillem Darry\n beckons her into the house with the \nred door\n, in \nBraavos\n4\n. \nAn old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says \"Let him be\nthe king of ashes\";\n5\n. \na \nman\n who looks like \nViserys\n, but taller and with darker eyes, who says to a \nwoman\n nursing a baby, \"\nAegon\n…\nWhat better name for a King… He is the Prince that was Promised, and his is the song of ice and fire\"; and\nwhen the man’s eyes meet Dany’s, he says either to her or the woman with the baby, \"There must be one\nmore… The dragon has three heads\", and he picks up a silver harp and begins to play;\n6\n. \na vision of Pyat Pree telling her the visit is over, and to follow him into a garden;\n7\n. \na great hall with several robed people claiming to be the Undying \nQarth\n, who tell her, \"We sent the comet to\nshow you the way (to Qarth)… shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?\", but it turns out to be\nsorcery.\nFinally, Daenerys comes upon a room with several figures that are no more than shadows, unbreathing, and over\nthem floats a human heart, blue and corrupted (these are apparently the real Undying). The figures speak inside\nDany’s head:\nwe know… the shape of shadows… morrows not yet made… drink from the cup of ice… drink from the cup of\nfire… Mother of Dragons… Child of Three… three heads has the dragon\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_66020dd7812eb4daadb3586e737c182bacdbe4b91844fe4f503908f7b173b7c5_v2"}
