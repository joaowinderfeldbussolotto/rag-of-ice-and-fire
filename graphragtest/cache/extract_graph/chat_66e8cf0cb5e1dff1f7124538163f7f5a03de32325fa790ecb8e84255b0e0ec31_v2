Tyrion notes\nthat this can be used as propaganda against Stannis.\nCersei brings up the accusations again and urges an edict to suppress its dissemination. Tyrion points out that tearing\nout a man's tongue only proves you fear what he might say. When Cersei asks what he proposes, Tyrion suggests\nthey just let people whisper until they grow bored; without proof many will see the letter as Stannis' pathetic attempt\nto justify his rebellion. Littlefinger agrees, adding that they should fight fire with fire by spreading a similar rumor\nthat \nShireen Baratheon\n is a bastard and Stannis a cuckold.\nLittlefinger proposes Shireen's fool \nPatchface\n should be called the father to make the story more shocking. Pycelle\nexclaims that Lady Selyse would never bring a fool into her bed, but Littlefinger replies one would have to be a fool\nto want to bed Selyse. He adds that the fool's devotion to the girl, and their similarly mottled, half-frozen faces will\nenforce the tale. Pycelle protests that Shireen was scarred by \ngreyscale\n, but Littlefinger notes the smallfolk are not\nknown for their intelligence. Cersei smiles and calls Littlefinger wicked, and he thanks her. Tyrion recommends the\nnews not come from them lest it be seen as the self-serving lie it is, and Littlefinger suggests using whores and pot-\nshops.\nTyrion takes his leave, and when Cersei asks why, he tells her he is having a gift made for Joffrey: a little chain.\nCersei retorts that Joffrey has lots of chains and Tyrion cannot buy his love. Tyrion replies that one day Joffrey may\ntreasure this chain above all others.\nBronn\n is waiting outside to inform Tyrion the smiths he summoned are waiting in his audience chamber. Tyrion\ncompliments the sellsword that he almost sounds like a proper courtier and teases that he will be kneeling next.\n\nBronn responds with, \"Fuck you, dwarf.\" Tyrion counters with, \"That's \nShae\n's task.\" As Bronn escorts him back to\nthe \nTower of the Hand\n, Lady \nTanda Stokeworth\n hails Tyrion, but he ignores her and gives orders for his litter to be\nprepared. In his chambers, he finds his timid squire \nPodrick Payne\n laying out his clothing and the \nHand\n's chain of\noffice.\nEntering his audience chamber, Tyrion cuts straight to the point by presenting the assembled smiths with three links\nof an immense chain and commanding them to make a thousand more. He orders every forge and every metalworker\nin the city put to work making and joining more links, and puts Goodman \nIronbelly\n in charge of seeing it done. The\nsmiths immediately ask about the queen's orders for armor and weapons, and her threat of crushed hands for missed\nquotas. Tyrion assures them no hands will be crushed, thinking of the love Cersei is creating for them among the\nsmallfolk. Ironbelly asks about supplies of iron and coke, and Tyrion promises Lord Baelish will see they have\nenough coin while the \nCity Watch\n will help them find and melt down every horseshoe in the city for iron if required.\nThen an older smith, \nSalloreon\n, complains that such work is only fit for common smiths, not master armorers like\nhimself. He offers to make Tyrion a terrifying suit of plate instead, but Tyrion replies that he can either make chains\nor wear them, and then departs.\nOutside, Bronn waits with a litter and an escort of \nBlack Ears\n. As he travels, Tyrion muses that he has set hundreds\nof carpenters to building fishing boats instead of catapults, opened the \nkingswood\n to hunters, and even sent gold\ncloaks foraging to deal with hunger in the city, but people still give him accusing looks. He also reflects that Cersei\nmissed the importance of Stannis declaring himself king, and wonders what \nRenly Baratheon\n will make of it.\nPeering out into the streets he wonders who the informers in the crowd are, and decides they are likely the most\ninnocent-looking ones.\nHis destination is a two-story \nbrothel\n behind \nRhaenys's Hill\n. Inside, he is greeted by a tall, black-skinned woman\nwho names herself \nChataya\n. When Tyrion asks to see the girls, Chataya recommends a dark-skinned girl of 16 who\nturns out to be her daughter \nAlayaya\n; in the \nSummer Isles\n being a whore is considered an honor and pleasing to the\ngods. Tyrion wonders what the gods have to do with it, and jests that he would be much more religious if he could\npray with his cock.\nLeading Tyrion upstairs to the turret room, Alayaya directs him into a wardrobe, where he finds a secret panel and\nbeyond that a hidden shaft leading down to an underground tunnel where Varys waits in disguise. Tyrion asks if\nChataya can be trusted, and Varys explains she has no love for the queen and is\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_66e8cf0cb5e1dff1f7124538163f7f5a03de32325fa790ecb8e84255b0e0ec31_v2"}
