Melisandre tells Davos that there are only two gods,\nR'hllor\n and the \nGreat Other\n, whose name cannot be spoken. They are opposites, white and black, good and evil, fire\nand ice. The Other is the god of Darkness, the Soul of Ice and his war with R’hllor is everywhere and everlasting.\nMelisandre claims that the \nOther’s\n servants often hide in plain view, but the priests of R’hllor can see through\nfalsehoods. She explains that she saw in the flames that Davos wanted to murder her. Davos admits to this, blaming\nher for the death of his sons who died in the \nBattle of the Blackwater\n. Melisandre speaks of a prophesy, which\nportends that \nAzor Ahai\n will be born again in the light of R’hllor, and she is convinced that Stannis is the\nembodiment of this prophecy: \"When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again\namidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.\" Melisandre departs, telling him that he (Davos) has served\nR’hllor once and will do so again.\nLater, \nAxell Florent\n brings his brother \nAlester\n, Stannis’ \nHand\n, and tosses him into the cell with Davos. Lord Florent\nis a defeated man, and he tells Davos that his nephew \nImry\n died with the fleet, and that most of Stannis’ bannermen\nwere captured at the battle and bent the knee to \nJoffrey\n. He is now condemned as a traitor for writing a letter he\nplanned to send to Lord \nTywin\n, offering peace and suggesting that Stannis would swear fealty to Joffrey but would\nremain Lord of Dragonstone and \nStorm's End\n, and that the Florents would get \nBrightwater Keep\n back. In addition,\nhe offered \nShireen\n’s hand in marriage to \nTommen\n. Alester rants about Melisandre’s talk of a stone dragon,\n\"madness, sheer madness. Did we learn nothing from \nAerion Brightfire\n, from the nine mages, from the alchemists?\nDid we learn nothing from \nSummerhall\n?

In order to pay the slave masters, Daenerys offers all three of her ships as well as\nDrogon\n, for the price of a dragon is incalculable.

To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass\nbeneath the shadow.\" When the time for the deal to be brokered arrives, Daenerys swings the slaver's whip in\nKraznys\n' face, and releases Drogon on him, shouting, \"Drogon!
