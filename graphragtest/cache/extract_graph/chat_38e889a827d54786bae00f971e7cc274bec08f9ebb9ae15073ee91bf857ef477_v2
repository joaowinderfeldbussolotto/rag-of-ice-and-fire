The list of those that must present themselves to swear fealty goes\non for a long time. Finally, near the end, the names of Sansa’s own \nfamily\n are called, even down to \nArya\n and\nRickon\n. The naming of Arya suggests to Sansa that her sister must have escaped and be safe in \nWinterfell\n.\nIt is then announced that the king’s grandfather, Lord \nTywin Lannister\n is to take up the office of \nHand of the King\n in\nplace of the traitor \nEddard Stark\n. It is also decreed that Cersei Lannister, as Queen Regent, be seated on the \nsmall\ncouncil\n in place of \nStannis Baratheon\n and that \nJanos Slynt\n, Commander of the \nCity Watch of King's Landing\n, be\nraised to the rank of Lord and granted the ancient seat of \nHarrenhal\n as well as a seat on the small council. Janos\nSlynt then enters the hall, displaying his new \nlordly sigil\n, to take his seat at the council table. The elevation of Slynt,\na butcher’s son, to the lordship of Harrenhal visibly angers many of the knights and lords present. Finally, Pycelle\nreads a decree that, in these times of turmoil, the council considers the safety of King Joffrey to be of paramount\nimportance.\nQueen Cersei stands and calls forth Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n. She proceeds to thank the old knight for his many years of\nservice in the Kingsguard, but declares that the time has come for him to set aside his burden. Ser Barristan is\nconfused until the new-made Lord Slynt explains bluntly that he is being relieved as \nLord Commander of the\nKingsguard\n. Ser Barristan is plainly stunned and protests that only death may relieve a Kingsguard of his sacred\ntrust. Cersei asks whose death: his or his king’s. Joffrey goes even further, accusing Ser Barristan of letting his\nfather die and declaring him too old to protect anyone.\nSer Barristan reminds them that he has long ago forsaken his \nancestral lands\n and \nkeep\n and a wife-to-be in order to\nserve in the Kingsguard. He goes on to recount his history as a member of the Kingsguard, protecting and serving\n\nthree kings. \nLittlefinger\n notes that all three of these kings are dead. Then Cersei reiterates that Ser Barristan’s time is\ndone because Joffrey needs young and strong men around him, and that Ser \nJaime Lannister\n will succeed him as\nLord Commander. Ser Barristan is outraged that a man who killed the king he swore to protect should be made the\nLord Commander.\nVarys\n attempts to calm the situation, insisting that they are not ungrateful to Ser Barristan and that Lord Tywin\nLannister has agreed to grant Ser Barristan a tract of land in the \nWesterlands\n with men and gold sufficient to build a\nstout keep and servants to see to his every need. Ser Barristan venomously describes such a gift as a hall to die in\nand men to bury him. He removes his white cloak and armor and drops them on the floor, declaring that he will die a\nknight. Littlefinger quips “A naked knight, it would seem,” which raises laughs from the entire hall, even the\nremaining members of the Kingsguard.\nThe laughter ends abruptly when Ser Barristan draws his sword, but the old knight insists they should have no fear,\neven though he could still cut down the remaining five Kingsguard with ease. He adds in disgust that any man who\nwould serve under the Kingslayer does not deserve the white cloak. Then he throws his sword at the foot of the Iron\nThrone, declaring to Joffrey, “Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others.” Before he leaves, the old knight\nsuggests that perhaps \nStannis\n will depose Joffrey and sit upon the throne. The knight’s footsteps echo through the\nhall as he takes the long way out.\nJoffrey is incensed at Ser Barristan’s talk of Stannis and at being called a boy. He orders Ser Barristan seized and\nquestioned. Finally, Janos Slynt announces that his gold cloaks will see to it. It is then announced that \nSandor\nClegane\n will fill the vacancy created by the departure of Ser Barristan. Joffrey asks the Hound what he thinks, and\nClegane declares that he has no lands or wife to forsake, but that he will not take a knight’s vows. Ser \nBoros Blount\nof the Kingsguard protests that the members of the Kingsguard have always been anointed knights, but is quickly\nrebuffed.\nThe time has finally come for Sansa when she hears the herald ask for any further business. She nervously comes\nforward, thinking that she must be as strong as her \nlady mother\n. She calls out and Joffrey, seeing her, tells her to\ncome forward, which emboldens her. She begs mercy for her father. Queen Cersei expresses displeasure, but Varys\nonly claims that she is a child who does not understand what she says. Joffrey tells the others to let her speak.\nThe small council questions her about her father’s treason, and Sansa knows better than to deny it. Instead she tells\nthem that others must have lied to her father, and that he only claimed Joffrey was not the king because of the pain\nfrom his broken leg and the effects\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_38e889a827d54786bae00f971e7cc274bec08f9ebb9ae15073ee91bf857ef477_v2"}
