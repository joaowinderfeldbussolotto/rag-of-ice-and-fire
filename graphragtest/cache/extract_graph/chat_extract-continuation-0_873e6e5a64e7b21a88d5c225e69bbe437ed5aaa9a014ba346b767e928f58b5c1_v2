She is aware Grell has dispatched\nSer \nRobin Ryger\n to bring back Jaime, and hopes that he fails. Her father's room smells of death and it makes Cat\nthink of Ned and her two youngest boys. Lord Hoster is having fever dreams and mumbling, \"Forgive me...the\nblood...oh, please...Tansy...\" \"Dead.\" \"…you’ll have others…sweet babes, and trueborn…\" Catelyn recalls that \nLysa\nhas had five miscarriages since her marriage and deduces that Lysa must have miscarried before marrying as well.\nShe realizes that \nJon Arryn\n had no heir at the time of her and Lysa's twin betrothals. He was older than their father\nand as a soiled bride, \"Lysa was the price Jon Arryn had to pay for the swords of \nHouse Tully\n.\" She does not know\nwho the father of the original miscarriage might have been. Catelyn writes a letter to Lysa pleading for her to come\nto Riverrun before their father passes away saying, \"He needs your forgiveness,\" but she realizes Lord Hoster will be\ngone before the raven even makes it to \nThe Eyrie\n. Catelyn goes to the \nsept\n and lights three candles. One for the\nFather Above\n for her own father. One for the \nCrone\n \"who let the first raven into the world when she peered through\nthe door of death\" and one for the \nMother\n for Lysa and all the children they had both lost.\nLater, Edmure returns to Riverrun, informing Catelyn that he turned away the \nLannisters\n, but that \nStannis\n lost the\nbattle\n for \nKing's Landing\n and that \nHighgarden\n and \nDorne\n have both declared for \nJoffrey\n. Edmure scolds Catelyn for\nfreeing Jaime and tells her \nCersei\n will never free Catelyn's daughters, but Catelyn claims \nTyrion\n will be held to the\nword he spoke in open court and the Kingslayer gave his word as well. Edmure dismisses the Kingslayer's words as\nworthless and informs Catelyn that Tyrion took an axe to the head and is most likely dead. Edmure has sent three\nravens informing \nLord Bolton\n that Jaime has escaped in the hopes of capturing him at \nHarrenhal\n. Catelyn despairs\nbecause if Jaime is believed to have escaped instead of being released as part of a prisoner swap, the Lannisters have\nno reason to free Catelyn's daughters.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VII\nA Clash of Kings\n↑\nJaime I\n ←\nCatelyn I\n→ \nArya I\n↓\nCatelyn II\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 3: Arya I\nPlace(s): \nSomewhere in the \nRiverlands\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya X\nA Clash of Kings\n↑\nCatelyn I\n ←\nArya I\n→ \nTyrion I\n↓\nArya II\nSynopsis\nArya\n, \nGendry\n, and \nHot Pie\n are using the map she stole from \nRoose Bolton\n to find the \nTrident\n.
