Her \"father\" is away at the wedding of Lord \nLyonel Corbray\n, who supports the Lord\nProtector along with several other Vale lords, including, just recently, Lord \nBenedar Belmore\n. Maester \nColemon\n is\nconcerned that Robert is being given \nSweetsleep\n too often, as it is poisonous over time. However, he sees no other\nway to get the boy down the mountain without a seizure. After riding the basket down to Sky, Alayne and the rest of\nthe household begin their descent on mules led by \nMya Stone\n. Accompanying them is Lady \nMyranda Royce\n, Lord\nNestor\n's daughter.\nRanda is a natural gossip, and tells Alayne that Lady \nWaynwood\n and Ser \nSymond Templeton\n both showed at Lord\nCorbray's wedding, and that \nRiverrun\n has yielded, but not \nDragonstone\n or \nStorm's End\n. Alayne is careful with her\nwords around the very clever Randa, although she stumbles when the woman mentions that Lord \nEddard\n's bastard\nnow commands the \nNight's Watch\n. She thinks to herself it would be sweet to see her \nhalf-brother\n once more. Randa\ndiscloses that \nHarry the Heir\n was recently knighted at a tourney, but Myranda doesn't like him because Lady\nWaynwood denied Lord Nestor's attempt to marry Randa to Harry. She also lets on that he has a bastard daughter\ndespite his young age. Their banter turns to Mya and how her beloved Ser \nMychel Redfort\n recently married one of\nLord \nYohn\n's daughters. Alayne reveals that Ser \nLothor Brune\n likes Mya, but doesn't believe that the bastard\ndaughter of \nRobert Baratheon\n is aware.\nAfter a rough stretch crossing a gorge, where Alayne has to carry a shaking Robert across, the party reaches the\nGates of the Moon. She discovers that her \"father\" has returned from the east, and she goes to see him immediately.\nLord \nPetyr\n is entertaining three hedge knights he recently hired for his household, one of whom is none other than\nSer \nShadrich\n of the Shady Glen. Dismissing them, Petyr imparts word of \nCersei\n's spiraling downfall, saying, \"It is\nquite vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but... it\nis a good thing that I thrive on chaos. What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three\nqueens, I fear.\" But he will not explain what he meant by \"three\" queens.\nPetyr then announces that he has a present for her- a marriage contract to Harry the Heir. He tells her that she must\nfirst win his approval before they are even betrothed, hopefully giving them enough time for \nTyrion\n to perish,\nallowing her to marry again. Lady Waynwood agreed to the proposal because despite Alayne's \"low\" birth, she is\nnonetheless the daughter of the Lord Protector; not to mention that House Waynwood is heavily in debt (much of it\nnow owed to Littlefinger). When Alayne asks how the young knight could be Lady Anya's heir when she has three\nsons, as well as daughters and grandsons, he tells her that Harry is actually Lord Robert's heir. He explains that Lord\nJon Arryn\n's sister married a \nWaynwood\n, and her only son perished at age three. But their youngest daughter married\na knight of \nHouse Hardyng\n, who are landed knights sworn to \nIronoaks\n, and begot a son, now Ser Harrold Hardyng.\nBesides Lord Robert, he is the only living male heir to the Arryns, since he is Lord Jon's great-nephew.\nWhen Alayne learns this truth, she utters, \"If Robert were to die...\" To which Lord Petyr replies, \"When Robert dies,\nHarry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn's bannermen will\nnever love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon... and when they come together\n\nfor his wedding, and you come out... clad in a maiden's cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the\nback... why, every knight in the \nVale\n will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright. So those are your gifts\nfrom me, my sweet Sansa...
