Ser Jorah also gives\nDaenerys more food for thought on hiring the Unsullied, pointing out that they don't rape nor put to the sword the\npopulation of cities they've conquered unless specifically ordered to, minimizing the bloodshed that will inevitably\noccur when Daenerys starts the war to reclaim her throne. He also points out their usefulness in answering Daenerys'\nquery as to why Astapor has never been sacked, since any enemy attacking Astapor would face the city's entire\ngarrison of Unsullied, there are few neighboring cities and nations that pose a threat, and the combination of the\nUnsullied's reputation and heavy bribes offered by Astapor's rulers are enough to dissuade passing Dothraki\nKhalasars\n from attacking the city.\nDaenerys is tempted, knowing that Viserys would purchase as many Unsullied as he could, but she questions if she\ncan be anything like \nRhaegar\n, to whom Arstan and Jorah keep comparing her, if the loyalty of her men is only based\non being bought and paid for.

The man indicates that the \nBastard\nof Bolton\n is offering gold for wolfskins and for word on the walking dead. Later, \nMeera\n tells a story of a hero who\nmight have been a \ncrannogman\n (judging from other characters in the story, presumably \nHowland Reed\n), during the\nyear of the false spring\n. This crannogman had left \nGreywater Watch\n and visited the \nGreen Men\n on the \nIsle of Faces\n.\nReturning home, he stopped at \nHarrenhal\n for the \ngreat tourney\n. Three squires accosted him and mocked him for his\nshort stature, knocking him to the ground until he was rescued by a \nshe-wolf\n. The story names no names, but from\ntheir references, we know who they are.\nThe story tells of \nJaime Lannister\n being named to the \nKingsguard\n, despite \nhis father\n's absence (Tywin had recently\nresigned as \nHand\n). The \nWild Wolf\n had asked \nAshara Dayne\n, one of princess \nElia\n's ladies-in-waiting, to dance with\nhis \nshy brother\n. \nThe pup\n offered the crannogman some armor so that he could take his vengeance on the squires\nduring the tourney, but the little man turned him down. The crannogmen prayed to the \nold gods\n, and the next day at\nthe tourney, a \nmystery knight\n called the \nKnight of the Laughing Tree\n defeated the knights whose squires had\nwronged the crannogman. Instead of collecting a ransom from the three defeated knights, the mystery knight asked\nthem to teach their squires honor. The Knight of the Laughing Tree disappeared before he could be unmasked,\ndespite the fury of King \nAerys II\n. The tourney was won by prince \nRhaegar\n, but Meera ends the story by saying that\nwhat happened next is a sadder tale that deserves its own telling.
