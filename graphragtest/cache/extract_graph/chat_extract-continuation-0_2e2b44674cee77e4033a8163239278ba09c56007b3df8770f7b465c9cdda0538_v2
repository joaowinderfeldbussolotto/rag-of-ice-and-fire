She wonders if the Red Keep has a pool like this with fragrant gardens, remembering \nViserys\n saying that the\n\nSeven Kingdoms are the most beautiful place in the world. She also thinks she no longer has Drogo’s khalasar\nbehind her, only her four fierce \nbloodriders\n, and that the Dothraki plundered but do not know how to govern. She\nponders Ser Jorah’s words: \"The Usurper will kill you.\" She then thinks about \nRobert Baratheon\n, strong as a bull,\nfearless in battle and loving war, who killed her brother \nRhaegar Targaryen\n, and his dogs: \nEddard Stark\n, \nTywin\nLannister\n and \nJaime Lannister\n. How will she overthrow them? Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys, who\nwas a fool, believed the realm would rise for their rightful king. She then decides that the \nBleeding Star\n has led her\nto Qarth for a purpose, and if the gods intend for her to conquer they will send a sign.\nNear eveningfall, \nIrri\n brings word that Ser Jorah has returned. He enters with \nQuhuru Mo\n, captain of the \nCinnamon\nWind\n out of \nTall Trees Town\n. Daenerys has her dragons all around her. He has the news that Robert Baratheon is\ndead, reported in \nOldtown\n, \nDorne\n and \nLys\n. There are tales that \nthe queen\n, his brother (\nStannis Baratheon\n or \nRenly\nBaratheon\n, or \nEddard Stark\n betrayed him. \nJoffrey Baratheon\n sits on the throne with \nHouse Lannister\n ruling, Robert’s\nbrothers have fled, and the \nHand of the King\n has been seized for treason. Jorah does not think it likely that Eddard is\na traitor, saying the long summer will come again before he besmirches his honor. Daenerys wonders if her brother\nwould have been wiser had he known that vengeance was so close at hand. When asked, the captain replies he is not\nreturning to \nWesteros\n for a year or more since his ship will sail east from Qarth, making the trader’s circle around\nthe \nJade Sea\n. When Daenerys states he has brought her a precious gift, he tells her that he has been amply repaid by\nbeing allowed to see dragons. She aks him to come to her one day in \nKing's Landing\n.\nAfter the trader leaves, Ser Jorah warns Daenerys of speaking so freely. Daenerys replies that the \nSeven Kingdoms\nare flying to pieces like the khalasar did after Khal Drogo died. Ser Jorah tells her that she will still need gold,\narmies, and ships. Daenerys responds that she knows this, but she is the blood of the dragon. Jorah goes on to say\nthat King Robert killed a dragon with a warhammer. To this she replies that dragons die, but so do dragon slayers.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys I\n↑\nArya VI\n ←\nDaenerys II\n→ \nBran IV\n↓\nDaenerys III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 28: Bran IV\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran III\n↑\nDaenerys II\n ←\nBran IV\n→ \nTyrion VII\n↓\nBran V\nBran\n is with \nMeera\n and \nJojen\n in the \ngodswood\n of \nWinterfell\n.

Jojen reveals that he has dreamed of the Winged Wolf chained to earth and a\nthree-eyed crow\n has been unable to free him from the chains. Finally, Bran tells them something of his dreams, and\nJojen keeps pressing. \nSummer\n gets aggressive and attacks as Bran gets angry, but the Reeds manage to climb a tree\nto avoid the wolf. Afterwards Bran asks Maester \nLuwin\n about Jojen’s greensight, and is told no man has the\ngreensight.\nSynopsis\nMeera\n, armed with a three pronged frog spear and a net, is facing \nSummer\n in the \ngodswood\n. Summer charges past\nthe spear, but is entangled in the net as he slams into her. \nBran\n tells her that she loses, but \nJojen\n, whom Old \nNan\ncalls “little grandfather” because he is so somber, points out that Summer is entangled in the net. After disentangling\nthe wolf, and Bran calling to him, she asks if Summer ever grows angry. Bran tells her not with him, and he has\nnever drawn blood. Meera is still worried, but Bran assures her that he would not have drawn her blood; he knows\nand likes her. Bran thinks about how Meera is so like his sister \nArya\n, and tells them that he wishes they were their\nwards instead of \nBig Walder\n and \nLittle Walder\n.
