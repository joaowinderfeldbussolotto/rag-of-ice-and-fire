Cersei still worries that Doran Martell might kill Myrcella to\navenge the murder of his sister \nElia Martell\n, but Tyrion insists Doran is too honorable to murder an innocent girl and\nthe terms are too rich to refuse: he has also promised the prince his sister's killer, a council seat, and some castles on\nthe \nDornish Marches\n. Cersei accuses Tyrion of offering too much without her consent, but he insists Doran would\nnot accept less and asks if Cersei means to offer sexual favors instead. When she slaps him, Tyrion promises her it\nwill be the last time, but Cersei only laughs and suggests Tyrion's faith that their father's letter will protect him might\nbe as misguided as \nEddard Stark\n's faith in King \nRobert\n's last will. Tyrion notes to himself that unlike Lord Eddard\nhe has the City Watch, his clansmen, and a party of sellswords, though he supposes Stark had delusions of support\nas well.\nRather than argue, Tyrion declares that Renly and Stannis will mount Myrcella's head beside Cersei's if they take the\ncity. To his astonishment, Cersei begins to cry, something Tyrion has not seen since they were children. Awkwardly\nhe moves to comfort her, but she wrenches away, which hurts more than any slap. He promises nothing will happen\nto Myrcella, but Cersei calls him a liar and declares he has not kept his promise to free Jaime. Tyrion assures her\nthat Jaime remains safe at Riverrun until he can find a way to free him.\nCersei laments that if she were a man she would not have allowed any of this to happen. She wonders how Jaime\ncould let himself be captured and questions what their father is doing hiding in \nHarrenhal\n. Tyrion assures her Lord\nTywin is making war, proposing that Tywin is a lion waiting to pounce while Robb is a fawn frozen by fear. Cersei\nis not convinced, pointing out that Jaime would not sit idle if their father were the prisoner. To himself, Tyrion\nagrees that Jaime never had any patience, but he only says that not everyone can be as bold as Jaime, but there are\nother ways to win a war, and Harrenhal is strong and well situated.\nCersei adds that King's Landing is neither and Renly's host will soon be at their gates. Tyrion assures her the city\nwill not fall in a day, giving Lord Tywin time to march down the kingsroad to take Renly in the rear. Hungry for\nreassurance, Cersei asks what will happen if Robb Stark marches. Tyrion explains that Harrenhal prevents \nRoose\nBolton\n from crossing the \nTrident\n to reunite the \nnorthern\n forces, and even if he could, Robb does not have the\nstrength to take Harrenhal and march on King's Landing. Meanwhile, Lord Tywin's army lives on the fat of the\nriverlands\n and their uncle Stafford is raising another army at Casterly Rock.\nWondering how Tyrion knows all this, Cersei asks if Lord Tywin confided in him. Tyrion replies that he only\nlooked at a map, which causes Cersei to accuse him of mere speculation. Drawing out Robb's peace offer, Tyrion\nasks why Robb would offer terms―even unacceptable terms―if he were winning. Suddenly all queen again, Cersei\n\nasks how the terms came to Tyrion instead of her, but Tyrion quips that his job as Hand is to hand her things. As he\nhands her the letter, Tyrion muses that getting slapped by Cersei is a small price to pay for her agreement to the\nDornish marriage, which he can sense he will now get. The identity of an informer is just the plum in his pudding.\nNavigation:\nTyrion IV\n↑\nArya V\n ←\nTyrion V\n→ \nBran III\n↓\nTyrion VI\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 21: Bran III\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran II\n↑\nTyrion V\n ←\nBran III\n→ \nCatelyn II\n↓\nBran IV\nActing as Lord of \nWinterfell\n, \nBran\n hosts the \nharvest feast\n and greets \nMeera\n and \nJojen Reed\n, who arrive to represent\ntheir father \nHowland Reed\n.That night, Bran dreams of the Reeds visiting the \ndirewolves\n in the \ngodswood\n.\nSynopsis\nBran\n rides his horse \nDancer\n into the Great Hall of \nWinterfell\n for the \nharvest feast\n.
