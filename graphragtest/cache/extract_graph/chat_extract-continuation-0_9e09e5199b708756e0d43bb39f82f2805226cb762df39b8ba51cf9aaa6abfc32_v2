Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n tells\nher that the girl \nMeris\n, whom they set free, said that the \nWindblown\n were willing to join her cause, if Dany gave the\nTattered Prince\n \nPentos\n. Dany cannot agree to pay this as \nIllyrio\n is from that city and has helped her more than\nanyone. Her obligations are to him first.\nShe then departs with her husband and they arrive at the pits, where \nStrong Belwas\n eats a bowl of fried locusts.\nHizdahr tells his wife that they are tasty as well, but she declines as Dany is not interested in the spicy food. There\nare twenty thousand spectators in the pit. As Hizdahr announces the fights, they chant her name, though they use the\nGhiscari\n word for \nMother\n because they cannot pronounce her \nWesterosi\n name. Dany thinks to herself that it is not\nher they love, but the fighting.\nThe first fight begins with a victory for the \nSpotted Cat\n, and there are many more after that. Following them, the first\nfolly of the day begins with two dwarfs jousting, \none on a pig\n, \nthe other on a dog\n. One dwarf has a shield painted in\nthe colours of \nHouse Lannister\n, which amuses Daenerys. That one falls off the pig and is chased by the other on the\ndog when Hizdahr tells Dany that they are about to loose the lions. She tells him this was not in their agreement, that\nthe dwarfs did not consent to this like the other fighters who died did, so she forbids that the lions slaughter the\ndwarfs.\nUp next is a bout between \nBarsena Blackhair\n and a boar. The fight goes well until the boar's tusk rips her open from\nthe knee to the crotch. The boar then jumps on her, pulling out her entrails, all to the displeasure of the crowd.\nDaenerys insists on leaving as she is disgusted and no longer wants any part in this. Strong Belwas becomes sick\nfrom his locusts, asking for a drink of milk.\nIt is then that \nDrogon\n appears, his attention drawn by the blood and screams. His fires sear the boar, before he eats it\nand then Barsena. A man runs to try to kill the dragon, jabbing a spear into Drogon's neck before the dragon kills\nhim. Hizdahr commands the rest of his spearmen to kill the dragon. Drogon roasts two spearmen, breaks the\npitmaster in two with a swipe of his tail and tears out the innards of another spearman. As Strong Belwas is puking,\nDany runs into the fighting pit in a mad state, hearing footsteps behind her. When she gets close, she fears the\ndragon does not recognize her and will kill her. As he blows fire at her she rolls under the flames, and she whips him\nuntil finally he allows her to mount him. She leaps onto his back, pulling out the spear. As she whips him again, he\ntakes flight, and she tells him to go higher, watching as Meereen grows smaller below.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys VIII\n↑\nTheon I\n ←\nDaenerys IX\n→ \nJon XI\n↓\nDaenerys X\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 53: Jon XI\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon X\n↑\nDaenerys IX\n ←\nJon XI\n→ \nCersei I\n↓\nJon XII\nSynopsis\nJon\n treats with \nTormund Giantsbane\n. His four thousand \nwildlings\n will be allowed past the wall, including\nmammoths and giants. They must leave one hundred boys as hostages at \nCastle Black\n, and yield all valuables to pay\nfor food. The mammoths are to go the long way around through \nEastwatch\n while the rest are allowed to go through\nthe gates.\nJon accompanies \nVal\n to go see \nQueen Selyse\n to tell her of the bargain. The queen is excited and tells him that her\nhusband will be proud, all the wildlings have to do is swear fealty to the king and convert to \nR'hllor\n. This is when\nJon tells her that this was not part of the bargain, and Val adds that the free folk do no kneel. Selyse is quite upset\nabout this. Val notices \nShireen\n's facial disfigurements, noting that it is \ngrey death\n. Jon tells her that it is not always\nfatal, but she is adamant that it is death, and that the baby \"monster\" must be taken out of that tower at once and\ncloser to her own person. She insists that Shireen is dead and that the queen and apparently Jon cannot see it.\nHe then goes to the top of the wall, wondering what has happened to \nMance Rayder\n and if he has found his sister\nArya\n. Up here he meets \nTorghen Flint\n of the \nfirst Flints\n and \nBrandon Norrey\n, the \nNorrey clan\n chief. Jon tells them\nthat the wildlings are coming through, though they are not happy about it because of past conflicts.
