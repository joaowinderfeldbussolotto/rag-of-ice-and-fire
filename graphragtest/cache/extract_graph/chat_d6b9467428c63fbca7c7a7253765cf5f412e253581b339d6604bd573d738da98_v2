His uncle \nKevan\n tells him that \nTywin\n, \nMace Tyrell\n,\nand \nOberyn Martell\n will stand in judgment of him. When Tyrion claims he may demand \ntrial by combat\n, his uncle\nreplies that \nCersei\n will name \nGregor Clegane\n as her champion. Tyrion sends for \nBronn\n, but finds the former\nsellsword\n to be a changed man, soon to marry \nLollys Stokeworth\n, and now being paid well by the Queen. The\nmercenary leaves Tyrion to fend for himself, unwilling to stand for the dwarf against the Mountain.\nAt the trial, Tyrion declares his innocence, and claims that \nSansa\n was not responsible either. The witnesses that\nCersei has brought forth are numerous, and since Tyrion has no witnesses of his own, their word is without refute.\nPycelle\n notes that Tyrion stole poisons from his solar, and \nTaena Merryweather\n claims to have seen Tyrion drop\nsomething into the \nKing\n’s wine.\nThat night, Kevan tells Tyrion that his only hope is to admit his guilt and he will be permitted to \ntake the black\n,\nthough Tyrion, remembering what happened to the \nlast man\n to be made such an offer, is dismissive. They talk about\nTyrion's father. Kevan is fiercely loyal to his brother, for it was Tywin who made the Lannisters' enemies pay for\ntheir abuse of their father \nTytos Lannister\n, who was a peaceful but weak man. The next morning, \nVarys\n nearly seals\nTyrion’s fate with damaging evidence against the dwarf.\nLater, Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion, and makes it clear that Cersei has tried to buy his vote in the judgment,\nmentioning marriage. But the Red Viper has other ideas, and even brings up the point that according to Dornish law,\nMyrcella\n is the heir, and that \nhis brother\n may well crown his ward. Oberyn relates the story Tywin had told him that\nit was \nAmory Lorch\n who killed \nElia\n and her children, but Tyrion tells him the truth--that Lorch only killed \nRhaenys\n,\nand it was the Mountain who killed \nAegon\n and raped and murdered Elia. The Red Viper speaks of saving Tyrion,\nnot as his judge, but as his champion.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VIII\n↑\nArya XII\n ←\nTyrion IX\n→ \nJaime VIII\n↓\nTyrion X\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 67: Jaime VIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime VII\n↑\nTyrion IX\n ←\nJaime VIII\n→ \nSansa VI\n↓\nJaime IX\nSynopsis\nJaime\n is looking through the \nWhite Book\n, the history of the \nKingsguard\n, updated throughout the ages by the Lord\nCommander. We learn much about \nBarristan Selmy\n, who gained the title ‘the Bold’ when he was just ten, riding as a\nmystery knight\n in a tourney at \nBlackhaven\n, where he was unmasked by the \nPrince of Dragonflies\n. Barristan was\nknighted at sixteen by King \nAegon V\n, and named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year by \nGerold Hightower\n.\nThe deeds and legends of Barristan the Bold are not lost on Jaime. He recalls the awesome fight between the \nSword\nof the Morning\n and the \nSmiling Knight\n of the \nKingswood Brotherhood\n, and thinks of his own childhood wishes:\nThat boy had wanted to be Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead.\nJaime then receives the five Kingsguard currently under his command, and tests each of them. He mocks \nBoros\nBlount\n for his cowardice and inability to protect Prince \nTommen\n, and tells him that from here on in, Blount will\ntaste all the King’s food. Blount storms from the room, and Jaime goes after \nOsmund Kettleblack\n. Disgusted that an\nupjumped \nsellsword\n with no reputation has been named to the Kingsguard, Jaime at least concedes that the man\nprobably knows how to fight.\nHaving heard the details of the Kingsguard's willingness to beat \nSansa Stark\n on Joffrey's orders, Jaime commands\nMeryn Trant\n to temper his obedience to the king while the king remains a boy, and to obey the \nQueen Regent\n, the\nHand\n, and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard instead. He gets \nBalon Swann\n to swear he will remain true to the\nCrown, even though his \nfather\n and \nbrother\n’s allegiance are in question.\nLastly, he questions \nLoras Tyrell\n, and finds the Knight of Flowers as cocky as he himself was in his youth. Jaime\nasks Loras about the supposed ghost of \nRenly Baratheon\n that fought at the \nBattle of the Blackwater\n at the van of his\nfather's forces, obtaining an admission that it was \nGarlan Tyrell\n inside the armor. Then he confronts Loras about\nBrienne\n, and commands him to judge the woman fairly, on his honour as a knight.\nConsidering Jaime’s words about \nRenly\n’s death, Ser\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d6b9467428c63fbca7c7a7253765cf5f412e253581b339d6604bd573d738da98_v2"}
