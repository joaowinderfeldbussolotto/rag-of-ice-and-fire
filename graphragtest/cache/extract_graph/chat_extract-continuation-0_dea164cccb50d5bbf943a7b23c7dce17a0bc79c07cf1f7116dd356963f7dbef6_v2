Sandor is not fighting his best and Arya realizes he\ndrank his wine too fast and is drunk. During the fight Arya stabs the squire in the belly and then sneaks up behind\nthe Tickler and stabs him over and over again in a rage until Sandor stops her. The squire is still alive but was\nmortally wounded and asks for mercy. Sandor tells Arya to give him mercy, and asks if she remembers where the\nheart is. She does. She recovers \nNeedle\n, which was carried by Polliver, and kills the squire.\nSandor, seriously wounded, says Gregor must hold the ford and that they will make for Saltpans and find a ship to\nthe \nVale\n. They leave the inn to travel on but the Hound is so wounded that he needs tending and they stop. The next\nday he is so weak that he falls out of his saddle. While he lies in a fevered sleep, Arya thinks about killing him. He\nwakes to see what she is contemplating and urges her to do it - to give him mercy - but Arya leaves him and rides on\nto Saltpans.\nShe tries to find a boat that goes to the North but only finds a trading ship \nTitan's Daughter\n with \nBraavos\n as its\ndestination. She doesn't have enough money to get on board but then she shows the captain the coin she got from\nJaqen H'ghar\n and says \"\nValar Morghulis\n\", which causes him to give her both a cabin and passage.\nNavigation:\nArya XII\n↑\nJon X\n ←\nArya XIII\n→ \nSamwell IV\n↓\nA Feast for Crows\nArya I\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 75: Samwell IV\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell III\n↑\nArya XIII\n ←\nSamwell IV\n→ \nJon XI\n↓\nSamwell V\nSynopsis\nAt \nCastle Black\n, \nGilly\n is nursing both her own son as well as \nMance Rayder\n's, as \nDalla\n died giving birth. \nSam\n and\nGilly have recently returned to Castle Black, meeting up with Ser \nDenys Mallister\n and the men from the \nShadow\nTower\n. They also joined with \nDywen\n, \nEdd\n and \nGiant\n, survivors from the Bridge of Skulls where \nBowen Marsh\n held\nback the \nWeeper\n's advance. Sam is happy to be reunited with \nJon\n, although he is wary of King \nStannis\n's army being\npresent at Castle Black. It was the king who defeated the \nwildlings\n, scattering their remnants back into the \nhaunted\nforest\n. \nVal\n wants to bring her sister's baby to Mance, but Jon tells her that only Maester \nAemon\n is permitted to see\nthe imprisoned wildling king. Alone, Sam asks Jon, \"Could there be honor in a lie, if it were told for a good\npurpose?\" Sam is considering sending Gilly and her son to \nHorn Hill\n, with a letter claiming that he fathered the boy.\nJon reveals that \nSlynt\n still considers him a traitor, because he did not kill Mance as he was sent to do. Sam\nremembers swearing to \nBran\n and \nJojen Reed\n not to reveal to anyone, even Jon, that Bran is still alive. \nColdhands\n'\nlast words to Sam were, \"Let the world believe the boy is dead. We want no seekers coming after us. Swear it,\nSamwell of the Night's Watch. Swear it for the life you owe me.\" And Sam has kept his vows to all three. Later,\nSam considers the last vote for a new Lord Commander, with Ser Denys Mallister still leading, but no one near the\nmajority. At dinner, Bowen Marsh withdraws his name from the voting, and backs Janos Slynt. When the votes are\ntallied that night, both Ser Denys and \nCotter Pyke\n have lost votes, and Slynt has gained on both of them. Sitting with\nGrenn\n, \nPyp\n and Dolorous Edd, Pyp suggests that if Sam were to persuade either Ser Denys or Cotter Pyke to set\naside their quarrels and back the other, a new Lord Commander could be decided. Preferably one who would be\nbeneficial to the Watch, so long as it was not Janos Slynt.\nNavigation:\nSamwell III\n↑\nArya XIII\n ←\nSamwell IV\n→ \nJon XI\n↓\nSamwell V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 76: Jon XI\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon X\n↑\nSamwell IV\n ←\nJon XI\n→ \nTyrion XI\n↓\nJon XII\nSynopsis\nJon\n is training with \nSatin\n in the yard, when \nMelisandre\n arrives to take him before \nStannis\n.
