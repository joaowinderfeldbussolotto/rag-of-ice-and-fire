Catelyn, who cannot understand how Marillion survived\nthe journey which killed so many others, agrees. Then Bronn, whose ferocious fighting helped cut their path to\nsafety, declares that he is also coming. Catelyn dislikes the sellsword because of his lack of kindness and loyalty,\nand would prefer to separate the sellsword from his fast friend Tyrion Lannister. However, Catelyn cannot politely\nrefuse after permitting Marillion to come and agrees.\nAs they travel, the Blackfish rides next to Catelyn. Catelyn recalls that her uncle was close to all the \nTully\n children\nand even \nPetyr Baelish\n when they were children despite a long feud with their father, Lord \nHoster\n. It had been in\ndefiance of Lord Hoster naming him the black goat of the Tully flock that Ser Brynden had taken a black version of\nthe Tully fish as his personal sigil. Catelyn recalls that the feud ended after the dual wedding of Catelyn and Lysa to\nEddard Stark\n and Jon Arryn, when the Blackfish left \nRiverrun\n to serve Jon Arryn in the Vale.\nAfter Catelyn finishes explaining her story, her uncle says her father must be warned, since Riverrun is right in the\n\npath of any Lannister attack. When Catelyn asks what the mood of the Vale is, he tells her that there is anger at the\nsuspicious death of the much-loved Lord Jon and the giving of the title of \nWarden of the East\n to \nJaime Lannister\n.\nLysa has instructed everyone to call young \nRobert Arryn\n the “True Warden of the East.”\nThe Blackfish also gives Catelyn the dire news that the young Lord Robert is unhealthy and cries when his dolls are\ntaken away, leading some to whisper that he is too weak for the seat. Some even suggest that \nNestor Royce\n, who\nruled as High Steward while Jon Arryn was serving as \nHand of the King\n, should rule until Robert comes of age.\nOthers believe that Lysa should remarry, but the Blackfish thinks she is just playing at courtship and intends to rule\nherself.\nWhen Catelyn states that a woman can rule as wisely as a man, the Blackfish replies that the right woman can, but\nnot Lysa. He explains that the death of her husband and the stillborn and miscarried children before that have left\nLysa unstable and hysterically protective of her only child. Above all, Lysa seems to fear the Lannisters and now\nCatelyn has brought a Lannister to her doorstep. Catelyn insists that Tyrion is her prisoner. In reply, her uncle notes\nthat Tyrion is not only not in chains but also carrying weapons with a sellsword trailing him like a shadow. Catelyn\nreminds him that Tyrion is not here by choice and that it was Lysa’s letter that started the whole business.\nAfter passing through a valley surrounded by the high mountains, they reach the \nGates of the Moon\n. Well above the\ngatehouse, Catelyn can see the looming mass of the mountain and high above the tower keeps of Stone, Snow, Sky,\nand then the Eyrie. Tyrion jests that if they plan to make him climb the mountain at night they might as well just kill\nhim now. He is told that they will rest until morning.\nWhen the dwarf asks how one gets up, he is told there are steps leading up the mountain and trained mules that go as\nfar as the way-castle called Sky. Beyond that the ascent is made on foot or in the winch baskets that bring up\nsupplies—the Eyrie is directly above Sky. Tyrion declines the offer of being sent up in a basket because his father\nwould not approve of him going up like a load of turnips if the others ascend on foot, claiming that Lannisters have a\ncertain pride. Catelyn responds that Lannisters have arrogance, avarice, and lust for power. Tyrion replies that his\nfather\n is the soul of avarice, Jaime has pride, and \nCersei\n lusts for power, but he is innocent as a lamb and will bleat\nfor her.\nThe portcullis is raised and they are met by Lord Nestor Royce. Brynden asks for hospitality for the night, and is\ntold that Catelyn has been instructed to go up tonight, but the rest can have the hospitality of the castle. Brynden is\nfurious, considering night ascent to be too dangerous without a full moon. The guide \nMya Stone\n then introduces\nherself and promises that no harm will come to Catelyn, citing her experience on a hundred night ascents. Stone is\nthe surname of bastards in the Vale and that reminds Catelyn of \nJon\n. She is speechless, but Lord Nestor states that\nMya has never failed him, and so Catelyn agrees to the night ascent.\nMya Stone guides Catelyn up the long path to the Eyrie in the dark, claiming that torches only blind one on a clear\nnight. Mya then tells Catelyn that \nMychel Redfort\n, a squire she loves, says she has the eyes of an owl. Catelyn\nknows that, because his family is highborn, the squire will never be allowed to marry a \nbastard\n.\nAt each way-tower they switch\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6e592d8485ceafbef8338c3829df6983c387767b6f54c7bea01e13a1ade52281_v2"}
