Jon asks that Sam be accepted as a sworn brother along with the others. Chett\ncomplains that it is no concern of the maester and Maester Aemon agrees that training is the responsibility of Ser\nAlliser. Jon continues on to explain about all he and the others have done to protect Sam.\nChett remains adamant that Ser Alliser will make a man of Sam or kill him trying. Jon replies that the Watch has\n\nneed of every man and thus to kill one in futile training would be stupid. Recalling Maester \nLuwin\n’s words about\nwhy a maester’s chain is made of many kinds of metal, Jon declares that the Watch (like a kingdom) needs all sorts\nof skills and knowledge. Then Jon asks why Sam could not be a steward. As a steward, Chett objects that it is not\neasy work fit for cowards: they keep the Watch alive by hunting, farming, gather firewood, make clothing, and bring\nup supplies. Maester Aemon calmly names a number of steward duties and Jon has to admit that none of them suit\nSam. Then Jon declares that there is one thing Sam can do better than anyone else: help Maester Aemon, since he\ncan do sums, read, write, and is good with animals like the ravens. The maester considers this for a while and then\ntells Jon that he will think on it.\nNavigation:\nJon IV\n↑\nCatelyn VII\n ←\nJon V\n→ \nTyrion VI\n↓\nJon VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 42: Tyrion VI\nPlace(s): \nThe \nhigh road\n through the \nMountains of the Moon\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nJon V\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nEddard XI\n↓\nTyrion VII\nTyrion\n and \nBronn\n make camp on the \nhigh road\n. Tyrion wants to make a fire, but Bronn protests that it will bring the\nVale mountain clans\n down on them. Tyrion sees no point in trying to avoid the clans and Bronn gives in. As Tyrion\nplans, the \nStone Crows\n arrive and Tyrion negotiates an agreement.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n and \nBronn\n have taken shelter beneath some aspens just off the \nhigh road\n. Tyrion is gathering wood and asks\nBronn if a particular branch will do for a fire. Bronn asks if he has a death wish, as a fire will bring the \nVale\nmountain clans\n down on them. Bronn thinks it is best to travel fast at night, avoid the road, and make no noise or\nfires. Tyrion states that traveling fast at night is a good way to fall down the mountain and that the clans will find\nthem no matter what they do. Bronn replies that that means they are dead men. Tyrion insists that he would prefer to\ndie comfortable and asks if Bronn can find some game; he does not look forward to the salt beef and hard bread that\nLysa Arryn\n had provided them.\nBronn threatens to take Tyrion’s horse and leave, asking what Tyrion would do. Tyrion replies that he would\nprobably die. When Bronn asks if Tyrion believes his threat, Tyrion admits he does, commenting that Bronn was\nquick to finish off \nChiggen\n when he took an arrow in the belly. Bronn points out that Chiggen was as good as dead\nanyway and would have done the same for him.\nBronn explains that although he fought for Tyrion he is not his friend and not his servant. Tyrion accepts this with\ngood humor, stating that he is mainly interested in Bronn’s sword, not his friendship. When Bronn asks how Tyrion\nknew he would be his champion, Tyrion explains that he did not know, but anticipated Bronn’s \nsellsword\n nature: go\nfor the gold. Bronn helped take Tyrion captive in hopes of a reward, but the \nStarks\n are too proud to take lowborn\nscum like Bronn into their service permanently, so Tyrion had gambled that Bronn would abandon Lady \nCatelyn\n for\nthe next hopeful venture: rescuing him.\nBronn tells Tyrion that he has a bold tongue and that someday somebody will cut it out and make him eat it. Tyrion\nreplies that everyone tells him that. Tyrion then declares that although Bronn is scum, he is not stupid and knows\nwhere his best interest lie, luckily for Tyrion. When Bronn quickly lights the fire with flint, Tyrion compliments that\nBronn is also useful and almost as good with a sword as his brother \nJaime\n.\nThen Tyrion asks what Bronn wants: gold, land, or women. He promises that if Bronn keeps him alive he will have\nit. Bronn asks about what happens if Tyrion dies. Tyrion quips that then he will have one sincere mourner. Bronn\nthen informs Tyrion that his is no man’s toady. Tyrion replies that he is sure Bronn is no man’s friend, adding that\nhe is sure Bronn will betray him just like Lady Stark if there is a profit. However, Tyrion begs Bronn to remember\nthat he will match any price offered to betray him because he likes living. Bronn disappears to go hunting at\nTyr\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_aa7994d07a7777f490b42a11a24cf999394d850145b0e4ea1360da5157539821_v2"}
