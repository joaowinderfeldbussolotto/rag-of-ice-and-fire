Mormont asks where Jon believes his place is. Jon thinks that he has no place, no mother, and now\nno father, but only says he does not know. Mormont says that he knows Jon’s place. The cold winds are rising:\nCotter Pyke\n’s men have reported \nmammoths\n and \nhuge misshapen tracks\n near \nEastwatch\n. \nDenys Mallister\n has\nreported that the \nwildlings\n are abandoning their villages near the \nShadow Tower\n and \nQhorin Halfhand\n has taken a\ncaptive who revealed that \nMance Rayder\n, the \nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\n, is massing his people in some secret\nstronghold for an unknown purpose. Then the Lord Commander asks if Jon thinks his brother’s war is more\nimportant than theirs is. He also asks Jon if he thinks it matters who sits the \nIron Throne\n when \ndead men\n come\nhunting in the night. Jon has to agree; he has never thought of it that way before.\nMormont goes on to say that he believes Jon and Ghost were meant to be here, because the blood of the \nFirst Men\n,\nwho built the Wall, is strong in the \nStarks\n of Winterfell; they remember things other men have forgotten. In addition,\nGhost led them to the two wights. Some men, like Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n, might call that happenstance, but Mormont\nstresses that Ser Jaremy is dead and he is alive. He wants Jon and Ghost with him when they go \nbeyond the Wall\n; he\nwants to find \nBenjen Stark\n, alive or dead.\nWhen Jon asks what he means, Mormont declares that he will not sit meekly and wait for the snows to come. The\nNight’s Watch will \nride in force\n against the wildlings, \nthe Others\n, and whatever else is out there. Mormont plans to\ncommand them himself. He continues that the Lord Commander’s steward also serves as his squire, but he does not\nwant to be looking over his shoulder. Therefore, he asks Jon:\n\nAre you a brother of the Night’s Watch or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?\nJon pauses to apologize mentally to all his family before declaring that he is Mormont’s man and that he will not run\nagain. Mormont expresses his approval and orders Jon to go put on \nhis sword\n again.\nNavigation:\nJon VIII\n↑\nTyrion IX\n ←\nJon IX\n→ \nCatelyn XI\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nJon I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 71: Catelyn XI\nPlace(s): \nRiverrun\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn X\n↑\nJon IX\n ←\nCatelyn XI\n→ \nDaenerys X\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nCatelyn I\nCatelyn\n returns to \nRiverrun\n for the first time in many years. After meeting with her ailing \nfather\n, she seeks out \nRobb\nin the \ngodswood\n. After praying with his bannermen, Robb calls a council to determine their next move. The council\nargues for hours about which way to march and which king to support until \nGreatjon Umber\n gives a rousing speech\nand the bannermen proclaim Robb the \nKing in the North\n.\nSynopsis\nTo \nCatelyn\n, it seems a thousand years since she left \nRiverrun\n by boat with an infant \nRobb\n to head north to \nWinterfell\nfor the first time. Now she is returning by boat across the \nsame river\n with a son who wears plate and mail instead of\nswaddling clothes. With them in the boat is \nTheon Greyjoy\n, and in the boat following are \nBrynden Tully\n, \nGreatjon\nUmber\n, and \nRickard Karstark\n.\nAs they draw near, the men on the walls cheer them as the banners of \nHouse Tully\n fly from every rampart, but\nCatelyn cannot feel anything but sadness since she received news of \nher husband\n’s death, and she wonders if her\nheart will ever lift again. After passing under the wall through the wide Water Gate, they are greeted on the water\nstair by Catelyn’s brother Ser \nEdmure Tully\n and Lord \nTytos Blackwood\n. A worn-looking Edmure embraces Catelyn,\nexpresses his condolences, and promises vengeance against the \nLannisters\n. Catelyn only says that it will not bring\nNed back, then states she has to see \nher father\n.\nShe is escorted to her father’s solar in the keep, which is three-sided like Riverrun itself. Along the way, Catelyn\nasks about her father, and--as expected--Edmure explains that he is dying. When Catelyn demands to know why she\nwas not notified, Edmure explains that with the \nSeven Kingdoms\n so volatile their father forbid it; if word had gotten\nout that he was ailing, the Lannisters might have attacked. Catelyn immediately blames herself, remembering it was\nshe who sparked the war by \narresting\n \nTyrion Lannister\n.\nThe solar\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
