Tyrion is sure he can win a trial since the \nStarks\nhave no proof.\nTyrion wonders which of his siblings sent the footpad to kill \nBran Stark\n and if they also conspired in the death of\nJon Arryn\n. If Arryn was murdered it was subtly done, whereas sending a footpad to kill Bran was unbelievably\nclumsy. This leads Tyrion to wonder if there is some other force involved that has made him a pawn; Tyrion hates\nbeing a pawn.\nTyrion decides that he must free himself, and soon. He has no chance of overpowering Mord, so he must talk\nhimself out. Tyrion hammers on the door, yelling for Mord. Mord is furious that Tyrion is making noise. Tyrion,\nremembering not to show fear, asks if Mord would like to be rich. Mord only strikes him with a leather strap. It\ntakes a great deal of talking about \nLannister\n gold while getting slapped before Mord finally starts to listen. Tyrion\nexplains that, although she relieved him of his purse, Catelyn Stark would never rob him; therefore the gold is still\nhis. Tyrion promises all of his gold to Mord in exchange for Mord telling Lysa Arryn that he wishes to confess his\ncrimes. Tyrion even goes so far as to lie that his brother \nJaime\n wears solid gold plate armor (it is actually gilded\n\nsteel, but Mord would never know the difference}. When Tyrion senses Mord’s suspicion, he offers to write down\nthe deal and Mord brings him a pen and paper.\nTyrion is shivering in his sleep when Ser \nVardis Egen\n arrives to bring him to Lysa. Before he leaves, Tyrion asks\nMord for his shadowskin cloak and Ser Vardis orders the unhappy jailer to hand it over. The High Hall is filled with\nknights and retainers to hear his confessions. Tyrion is happy to see that young Lord Robert is missing from the high\nthrone. Tyrion is also pleased to see \nBronn\n and \nMarillion\n among the witnesses; with a singer present, whatever\nhappens will not remain a secret.\nLysa comments to her sister that the sky cells always break prisoners, but Catelyn only says that Tyrion does not\nappear broken to her. Tyrion declares to himself that the time has come to roll the dice. He starts by declaring\nhimself a vile little man and that his crimes and sins are beyond counting: whoring, gambling, wishing his own\nfather and sister dead, and speaking ill of the royal court. Soon he is interrupted by a furious Lysa and Catelyn tells\nhim pointedly that he is there to confess to the attempted murder of \nBran Stark\n and the murder of Jon Arryn. Tyrion\nmerely replies that he cannot confess to those crimes because he is innocent.\nLysa orders Tyrion taken back to a smaller sky cell with a steeper floor. Before he can be taken, Tyrion asks loudly\nif this is how justice is done in the \nVale\n: he is accused of crimes, he denies them, and so he is thrown into a cell. He\nmakes sure to show his bruised face to the crowd. Tyrion demands a trial where he can defend himself and be\njudged by gods and men. Lysa states that if Tyrion is found guilty, he will go through the “moon door”, which leads\nonly to a fatal plunge to the mountainside below. Catelyn tells Lysa that this is unwise. Lysa states that her son will\nhear and judge Tyrion’s trial. Tyrion remembers Lord Robert stating that he wanted to see him fly.\nTyrion demands a trial-by-combat, which the fills the hall with derisive laughter. There are shouts throughout the\nhall, with most men asking to be given the honor of championing Lysa Arryn’s cause. Lysa declares that Ser Vardis\nEgen, the only silent man, will be her champion. Ser Vardis sinks to one knee, but declines the honor, insisting that\nto slaughter such a defenseless man would be shameful. Tyrion is quick to agree, demanding a champion the same\nas Lysa and naming his brother \nJaime\n. When Lysa refuses Tyrion’s choice on the grounds that Jaime is hundreds of\nleagues away, Tyrion turns to Marillion to insist that when he makes a ballad of these proceedings he be sure to\nmention that Tyrion was denied a champion and sent bruised and hobbling against Lysa’s finest knight. Lysa tells\nhim to name another champion. For a moment no one moves and Tyrion wonders if he has made a terrible mistake.\nThen there is a stirring in the back of the chamber, and Bronn calls out that he will stand as champion for Tyrion.\nNavigation:\nTyrion IV\n↑\nBran V\n ←\nTyrion V\n→ \nEddard X\n↓\nTyrion VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 39: Eddard X\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard IX\n↑\nTyrion V\n ←\nEddard X\n→ \nCatelyn VII\n↓\nEddard XI\nNed\n dreams of the \nshowdown\n at the \nTower of Joy\n.
