Tyrion insists\nhe is not interested in treasonous table talk, which Varys calls wise.\nTyrion returns to his solar to find \nBronn\n waiting. The sellsword asks about Slynt, and Tyrion admits he has likely\n\nreplaced one of Littlefinger’s men with one of Varys’. Tyrion asks how the recruiting is going, and Bronn explains\nthat he only hires the sellswords who make a good impression in a duel. Tyrion asks if Bronn has killed any\ncandidates, and Bronn answers, “No one we could have used.” Tyrion asks what should happen if one of them kills\nBronn, but Bronn only says that man will be one Tyrion wants to hire. Tyrion asks Bronn if he would kill an infant\ngirl without question when commanded. Bronn replies, “Without question? No. I’d ask how much.” Tyrion remarks\nto himself that he does not need Slynt or Deem, since he has a hundred such men of his own. He wants to laugh or\ncry, but most of all he wants Shae.\nNavigation:\nTyrion I\n↑\nCatelyn I\n ←\nTyrion II\n→ \nArya III\n↓\nTyrion III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 9: Arya III\nPlace(s): \nSouth of the \nGods Eye\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya II\n↑\nTyrion II\n ←\nArya III\n→ \nDavos I\n↓\nArya IV\nArya\n and the others have abandoned the \nkingsroad\n to avoid the \ngold cloaks\n. As they travel west they come upon a\nburned village. When Arya goes to make water in the forest, she runs into a wolf pack, which scares her. She reports\nthis to \nYoren\n, who laments they should have taken a ship instead.\nSynopsis\nThe road \nArya\n and the other travel is now little more than two ruts through the weeds and the human flood has\nslowed to a trickle, so there is no one to say which way they go. However, the road wanders back and forth, tangles\nwith other trails, and sometimes vanishes entirely. Arya hates it. The terrain is gentle enough, but even so the path is\nnarrow enough that the wagons slow their pace to a crawl. A dozen times a day they must stop to free a wheel or\ndouble up the teams to climb a muddy slope.\nArya constantly looks over her shoulder, wondering when the \ngold cloaks\n will catch them. She does not trust their\nsentries, especially the orphan boys, who seem lost out in the woods. Arya can sneak past any of them when she\ngoes off in the night to make water alone. Once she snuck right up to \nLommy Greenhands\n and considered jumping\non him, but changed her mind at the thought of \nYoren\n punishing her again.\nThe orphans all treat \nGendry\n like someone special because the queen wants his head. Gendry will have none of it,\nthough. He insists he was only an apprentice armorer until Master \nTobho Mott\n told him he was to join the \nNight's\nWatch\n. Then he goes off to polish his bull helm, but never wears it. Lommy guesses Gendry is the \"\nwolf lord\n's\"\nbastard, which angers Arya, who knows \nJon Snow\n is her father's only bastard. She wishes she could ride home\nalone, but she knows that would mean no one to scout ahead, watch behind, stand guard while she sleeps, and help\nher fight off the gold cloaks.\nYoren decides the \nkingsroad\n will not be safe until they cross the \nTrident\n, so they intend to travel around the west\n(far) side of \nGods Eye\n. Settlements and farmland gives way to forest and the terrain grows rougher. Their provisions\nsoon run out, so Yoren turns to the poachers \nKoss\n and \nKurz\n to range ahead to hunt, and the younger boys are set to\npick berries and plunder orchards along the road. Arya is a skilled climber and a fast picker, and one day she comes\nacross a rabbit, which Yoren stews. Everyone else gets a spoonful, but Arya gets a whole leg and shares it with\nGendry.\nAt \nBriarwhite\n, some fieldhands force them to pay for the sweetcorn they have taken. Yoren gives them some\ncoppers, but complains that brothers of the Night's Watch used to be feasted throughout the realm, even by high\nlords. That night, Yoren is too angry to eat and only paces around the camp, muttering to himself. After that they\nfind men guarding the fields more and more.\nThe next day, Koss reports a camp of twenty or thirty men in mail and halfhelms armed with spears. Some of the\nmen are wounded or dying and they have only one horse, which is lame. The soldiers carry a banner of a \nspotted\ntreecat\n, which Yoren cannot identify. They go wide around the camp, since the men might be desperate enough to\ntake their horses or worse. The detour costs them two days at least, but Yoren insists they will spend the rest of their\nlives at \nthe Wall\n, so there is no rush to get there.\n\nOne evening, \nDobber\n spies a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_57d8a6b74df739222415c9628ddf1c776ae3c151f563427543d14dfd609d37d5_v2"}
