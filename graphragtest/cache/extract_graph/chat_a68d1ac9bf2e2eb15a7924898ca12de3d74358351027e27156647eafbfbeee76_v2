At every step of Stannis' speech, Jon clarifies whom he credits\nwith doing the actual deeds. Stannis asks Jon if there is honor in \nMance Rayder\n, and the young man claims there is.\nThe King speaks of the war that Melisandre has seen in her flames, and he confides that Jon may have a part in the\nupcoming battle. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and name him Lord of \nWinterfell\n, a goal he considers especially\nimportant due to all the strife occurring in \nthe North\n. Stannis intends to let the \nwildlings\n through \nthe Wall\n, and settle\nthem in the \nGift\n, should they pledge fealty and accept the \nLord of Light\n as their god. He also presumes to marry his\nloyal Lord of Winterfell to \nVal\n to solidify his peace with the wildlings, however Jon would have to adopt Stannis'\nfaith and burn the godswood of Winterfell.

His brother tells him that he is to be\nbeheaded on the morrow, and informs him that he coerced \nVarys\n into helping him charter a ship to take Tyrion from\nKing's Landing\n. When Jaime tells him that the rescue was a debt he owed him, Tyrion presses his brother, and learns\nthat \nTysha\n was not a whore, but a crofter’s daughter, just as she appeared. Lord \nTywin\n had forced Jaime all those\nyears ago to lie about Tysha so as to teach Tyrion a lesson. Tyrion is infuriated that his brother never told him the\ntruth, and punches Jaime in the face. Tyrion warns him that he will exact revenge against him, \ntheir father\n, and\nCersei\n, as a \nLannister\n always pays his debts. Jaime then asks if Tyrion poisoned \nJoffrey\n and, lying in his anger,\nTyrion admits to doing so. He also tells Jaime that Cersei is sleeping with \nLancel\n and Ser \nOsmund\n and perhaps\nothers, and that Joffrey would have been a monster worse than \nAerys\n if he remained king.\nTyrion stalks off without a further word, and confronts Varys for his betrayal. The eunuch concedes that he cannot\nfind a trace of \nSansa\n, then leads him deeper down, to the fourth level where \nMaegor\n had built torture chambers.\nWhen they come to a circular tower chamber with a ladder leading up, Tyrion realizes it leads up to the \nTower of the\nHand\n. Commanding Varys to wait for him, Tyrion ascends the wickedly high ladder. It leads to a secret passage\nbehind the rooms in the Tower, perfect for Varys’ \"little birds\" to overhear everything going on in the Hand’s\nquarters. He opens the secret door to his old chamber, and finds \nShae\n naked in his father’s bed, with the Hand’s\nchain of office around her neck. The whore pleads that the Queen made her say all those things against him in court,\nbut Tyrion strangles her with the chain he once wore. Grabbing a crossbow off the wall, he finds his father in the\nprivy. Tywin commands him to put down the crossbow, promising that he had no intention of carrying out the\nsentence, and would allow Tyrion to take \nthe black\n. Disbelieving his father, Tyrion questions him as to what became\nof Tysha. Lord Tywin reveals he did not have her killed, and doesn't know exactly what became of her. Tywin says\nhe supposed the steward sent the \"whore\" on her way. Tyrion then asks where the steward might have sent her and\nLord Tywin replies \"Wherever whores go\". Tyrion fires the crossbow sending the bolt into his father’s pelvis, killing\nLord Tywin.\nNavigation:\nTyrion X\n↑\nJon XI\n ←\nTyrion XI\n→ \nSamwell V\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nTyrion I\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 78: Samwell V\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell IV\n↑\nTyrion XI\n ←\nSamwell V\n→ \nJon XII\n↓\nA Feast for Crows\nSamwell I\nSynopsis\nKing \nStannis\n has brought several of the \nblack brothers\n before him to make known his anger about them taking too\nlong to select a new Lord Commander.
