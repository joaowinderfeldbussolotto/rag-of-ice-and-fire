When the kindly man asks who killed him, she\nreplies, \"Arya of \nHouse Stark\n.\" The priest again asks her who she is, to which she answers, \"no one\". But, as always,\nhe tells her she lies, then asks the waif to bring Arya some warm milk to help her sleep.

Sam recalls some of the ancient \nmaester\n's words during the sea voyage from \nBraavos\n, \"No one ever\nlooked for a girl. It was a prince that was promised... \nRhaegar\n, I thought... The error crept in from the translation.\nDragons\n are neither male nor female... \nDaenerys\n is the one, born amidst salt and smoke... Lady \nMelisandre\n has\nmisread the signs. \nStannis\n has some of the dragon blood in him, yes... \nRhaelle\n, \nEgg\n's little girl, she was how they\n(the Baratheons) came by it... They must send her a maester. Daenerys must be counseled, taught, protected...\"\nAemon begged Sam to convince the archmaesters of this, and later rambled some of the following (perhaps\nprophetic) lines: \"a glass candle that could not be lit; eggs that would not hatch; the sphinx was the riddle, not the\nriddler.\"\nGilly\n and Sam sit together after the eulogy, drinking rum. Gilly points out that had Aemon remained on the \nWall\n,\nMelisandre might have sacrificed him for his king's blood. \nJon\n must have known this, and sent the old maester, as\nwell as \nDalla\n's boy, to save them from the Red Woman's fires. Gilly then says that she will name the boy Aemon\nSteelsong once he reaches the age of two. Below decks, Sam and Gilly have sex, although he is consumed by guilt\nfor forsaking his vows. Afterwards, Sam tries to avoid Gilly, but \nKojja\n corners him and tells him that what he and\nGilly did was considered holy in the \nSummer Islands\n, a way of honoring the dead by celebrating life. Kojja advises\nSam that Gilly knows they can never be man and wife, but there was nothing wrong with them comforting each\nother on the long journey. Sam is persuaded, but perhaps it is because Kojja threatens to throw him overboard if he\ndoes not continue sleeping with Gilly.\nNavigation:\nSamwell III\n↑\nCat of the Canals\n ←\nSamwell IV\n→ \nCersei VIII\n↓\nSamwell V\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 36: Cersei VIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei VII\n↑\nSamwell IV\n ←\nCersei VIII\n→ \nBrienne VII\n↓\nCersei IX\nSynopsis\nLord \nAurane Waters\n has returned from \nDragonstone\n with news that the fortress has fallen.
