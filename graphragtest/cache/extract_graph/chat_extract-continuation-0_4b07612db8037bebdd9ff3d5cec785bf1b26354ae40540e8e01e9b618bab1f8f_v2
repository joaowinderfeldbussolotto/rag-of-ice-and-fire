Sansa also spies \nYohn Royce\n and whispers to Jeyne that he wears bronze armor that is thousands of\nyears old, engraved in runes that protect the wearer. Septa Mordane points out Lord \nJason Mallister\n in an eagle-\nwinged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor. The girls giggle at the warrior-priest \nThoros of Myr\n until the septa\ntells them he \nonce\n scaled the walls of \nPyke\n with a flaming sword. Although frightened by dark-skinned \nJalabhar\nXho\n, when Jeyne sees Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n she states she is willing to marry immediately. The procession carries\non, with many knights whom Sansa does not know. To Sansa it is better than in the songs.\nThey watch the tourney from a place of honor. \nJory Cassel\n, in drab armor, wins two matches, but loses a well-fought\nthird match to the freerider \nLothor Brune\n when King \nRobert\n judges Brune’s lance to have been steadier and better\nplaced. The other contestants from \nWinterfell\n do not fare as well. Sansa and Jeyne both scream sometimes when the\nriders crash together. Sansa notes that Jeyne often covers her eyes when a rider falls, but knows how a great lady\nmust act, and draws the approval of Septa Mordane for her composure.\nThe jousting goes on all day and into the evening. Ser Jaime the Kingslayer rides brilliantly, defeating Ser \nBarristan\nSelmy\n, who has already unhorsed two men thirty and forty years younger than himself. \nThe Hound\n and his immense\nbrother Ser \nGregor Clegane\n, the Mountain-that-Rides, seem unstoppable. On Ser Gregor’s second joust, his lance\nrides up and impales Ser \nHugh of the Vale\n in the neck, killing him. Ser Hugh, in his shiny new armor, falls not ten\nfeet from Sansa. Jeyne is so disturbed that she cannot stop crying, forcing Septa Mordane to take her away to regain\nher composure, but she never returns. Sansa is astonished to find herself unmoved by the death, until she realizes\nthere will be no songs sung of Ser Hugh.\nLord \nRenly Baratheon\n, a crowd favorite, is unhorsed so violently by the Hound that he seems to fly backwards and\nthe hard fall breaks a gold antler off his helm. Renly gives the broken antler to the Hound, who merely throws it into\nthe crowd, which erupts in a riot until Lord Renly restores order.\nBy the end of the day’s jousting, only four contestants remain: Ser Gregor Clegane, the Hound, Ser Jaime Lannister,\nand Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n. Sansa is entranced with Ser Loras, who is called the Knight of Flowers and has been giving\nwhite roses to various ladies in the crowd throughout the day. Finally, Ser Loras gives a red rose to Sansa, telling\nher, “No victory is half so beautiful as you.” Sansa is mesmerized for a long while until she notices Lord \nPetyr\nBaelish\n above her. He tells Sansa that she has \nher mother\n’s hair, touches her cheek, and leaves. The king announces\nthat the last three jousts will wait for the next day.\n\nLater, at the feast, Prince \nJoffrey\n sits next to Sansa. He has not spoken to her and she has not dared speak to him\nsince the \nfight\n on the \nkingsroad\n. Sansa remembers thinking at first that she hated Joffrey for \nLady\n’s death, but later\nshe rationalized that it is not Joffrey but Queen \nCersei\n and \nArya\n that are responsible. Now Joffrey is the soul of\ncourtesy, complimenting her by saying that Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty. Sansa asks if Ser Loras will win,\nbut Joffrey replies that either his uncle or his hound will defeat him, and that one day he will defeat them all. Joffrey\nfills her cup with wine, which makes her look at Septa Mordane, but when Joffrey fills the septa’s cup also, Sansa\nthanks him. He talks to her the rest of the night, making her laugh and helping her eat new foods like snails and trout\nbaked in clay. She can see that the arm \nNymeria\n savaged is still bothering him, but he does not complain.\nThe king grows louder with each course. Finally, drunk as a man can be, he starts shouting at Queen Cersei, telling\nher, “No! You do not tell me what to do, woman! I am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I\nwill fight tomorrow, I will fight!” Everyone stares, but no one interferes, and the queen storms off in silence. When\nJaime comes to him, the king pushes him away hard, causing Jaime to fall. The king boasts that he can still knock\nJaime in the dirt and that with his war hammer nobody can stand before him. Jaime replies stiffly, “As you say, your\ngrace.”\nJoffrey then tells Sansa it grows late and asks if she needs an escort back. With Septa Mordane asleep at the table,\nJoffrey calls\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SER GREGOR CLEGANE<|>PERSON<|>A gigantic knight known as the Mountain-that-Rides, feared for his immense size and strength)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>A young noblewoman observing the tourney and interactions with other characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEYNE<|>PERSON<|>A companion of Sansa who reacts emotionally to events at the tourney)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTA MORDANE<|>PERSON<|>A mentor figure guiding Sansa and Jeyne on proper behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOHN ROYCE<|>PERSON<|>A lord wearing ancient bronze armor engraved with protective runes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASON MALLISTER<|>PERSON<|>A lord distinguished by his eagle-winged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOROS OF MYR<|>PERSON<|>A warrior-priest known for scaling the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JALABHAR XHO<|>PERSON<|>A dark-skinned figure who frightens Jeyne)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERIC DONDARRION<|>PERSON<|>A lord whom Jeyne expresses willingness to marry immediately)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JORY CASSEL<|>PERSON<|>A knight in drab armor who wins two matches but loses a third)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOTHOR BRUNE<|>PERSON<|>A freerider who defeats Jory Cassel in a joust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>The king who judges the joust and later becomes drunk and confrontational)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER BARRISTAN SELMY<|>PERSON<|>An older knight who unhorses two younger men before being defeated by Ser Jaime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HOUND<|>PERSON<|>A fierce warrior and brother of Ser Gregor Clegane, known for his brutality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER HUGH OF THE VALE<|>PERSON<|>A knight killed by Ser Gregor Clegane during the joust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENLY BARATHEON<|>PERSON<|>A crowd favorite unhorsed violently by the Hound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER LORAS TYRELL<|>PERSON<|>The Knight of Flowers, known for giving white roses to ladies and charming Sansa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETYR BAELISH<|>PERSON<|>A lord who compliments Sansa on her resemblance to her mother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>A prince who sits with Sansa at the feast and behaves courteously)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERSEI<|>PERSON<|>The queen who storms off after a confrontation with King Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A character Sansa blames for Lady's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NYMERIA<|>PERSON<|>A name associated with an injury to Joffrey's arm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>A location associated with contestants in the tourney)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYKE<|>GEO<|>A location whose walls Thoros of Myr scaled with a flaming sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGSROAD<|>GEO<|>A location where a fight occurred between Sansa and Joffrey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOURNEY<|>EVENT<|>A jousting competition observed by Sansa and others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIGHT<|>EVENT<|>A confrontation on the kingsroad involving Sansa and Joffrey)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER GREGOR CLEGANE<|>THE HOUND<|>Ser Gregor Clegane and the Hound are brothers known for their brutality in the tourney<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JEYNE<|>Sansa and Jeyne are companions observing the tourney together<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEPTA MORDANE<|>SANSA<|>Septa Mordane guides Sansa on proper behavior and composure<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JORY CASSEL<|>LOTHOR BRUNE<|>Jory Cassel loses a joust to Lothor Brune, judged by King Robert<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER GREGOR CLEGANE<|>SER HUGH OF THE VALE<|>Ser Gregor Clegane kills Ser Hugh of the Vale during the joust<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE HOUND<|>RENLY BARATHEON<|>The Hound unhorses Renly Baratheon violently during the joust<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER LORAS TYRELL<|>SANSA<|>Ser Loras Tyrell gives a red rose to Sansa, charming her<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETYR BAELISH<|>SANSA<|>Petyr Baelish compliments Sansa on her resemblance to her mother<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOFFREY<|>SANSA<|>Joffrey sits with Sansa at the feast and behaves courteously<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT<|>CERSEI<|>King Robert confronts Queen Cersei in a drunken rage<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOFFREY<|>NYMERIA<|>Joffrey's arm was savaged by Nymeria, causing lasting injury<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JOFFREY<|>Sansa and Joffrey had a fight on the kingsroad<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>ARYA<|>Sansa blames Arya for Lady's death<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>TOURNEY<|>Sansa observes the tourney and its events closely<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEYNE<|>TOURNEY<|>Jeyne reacts emotionally to the events of the tourney<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
