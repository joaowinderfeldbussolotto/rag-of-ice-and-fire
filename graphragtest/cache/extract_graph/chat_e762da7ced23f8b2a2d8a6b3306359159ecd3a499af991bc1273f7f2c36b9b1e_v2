Bran replied that Sansa has lost\nher wolf, remembering the day four of the guardsmen returned with bones of \nLady\n. They buried the bones in the\ncemetery with the faithful servants of Winterfell; she went south and only her bones returned, like Lord \nRickard\nStark\n, \nBrandon Stark\n, and two hundred men, and none returned. Now \ntheir father\n, \nArya\n, \nSansa\n, \nJory Cassel\n, and \nFat\nTom\n have gone south and not come back and later \nmother\n and Ser \nRodrik\n left and have not come back. Now Robb is\ngoing south and it frightens Bran. Bran prays that the gods look after Robb and his men going south, and that they\ndefeat the \nLannisters\n and bring Father back.\nBran is surprised by words from \nOsha\n who is apparently able to move quietly in the shackles she has to wear. She\ntells him that she can hear the gods answering him. When Summer comes around the pool to sniff her, she flinches.\nBran calls Summer back and asks Osha, whom he has not seen since she was taken captive, what she is doing here.\nThe \nspearwife\n replies they are her gods too and the only gods beyond \nthe Wall\n. Bran notes that she looks more\nwomanly with her longer hair and her dress of brown roughspun. She tells Bran that \nGage\n lets her out to do her\nprayers from time to time while she lets him do what he wants under her skirt when he feels the need; it is nothing to\nher, she likes the smell of flour on his hands and he is gentler than \nStiv\n.\nShe offers to leave but Bran asks her to stay and tell him what she means about hearing the gods. She tells him to\nopen his ears, to which Bran replies that it is only the wind. Osha asks him who sends the winds, insisting that the\nold gods can see him and hear his words. Bran asks what they say and Osha replies that they are sad because they\ncannot help his brother in the South. The old gods have no power there because all the weirwoods were destroyed\nthousands of years ago; they cannot watch over his brother because they have no eyes.\nNow Bran listens and it seems there is sadness in the wind, but then he only hears Hodor, who arrives naked from\nhis bath in the hot springs. When Osha sees Hodor she declares that his size denotes \ngiant\n blood in him. When Bran\ntells her that Maester Luwin taught him that there are no more giants, Osha tells him that the Maester should ride\nbeyond the \nWall\n. The giants sometimes breed with men \nbeyond the Wall\n, producing half-breeds, though it goes\nmuch worse on the women that have sex with a giant. She then asks Bran if he knows what she is talking about and\nhe tells her does, as he has seen animals mating.\nAs Hodor leaves to dress at Bran’s command, Bran admits that he is very big. Osha confirms there are giants beyond\nthe Wall, and worse than giants: when men leave their fires they often do not come back, or sometimes they come\nback as \nwights\n with blue eyes and cold black hands. Osha explains that she tried to tell Robb, Maester Luwin, and\neven \nTheon Greyjoy\n of this, but they would not listen. She asks Bran why else she would flee south in the company\nof Stiv and the rest of those fools. She goes on to declare that \nMance Rayder\n, once a sworn brother of the \nNight's\nWatch\n, thinks he can fight the wights. Osha states that she, unlike Mance, is of the north, from a long line of the \nfree\nfolk\n. Osha laments again that she cannot get Robb to listen and Bran suggests that perhaps Robb will listen to him.\nOsha is dubious but gives Bran the message:\nYou tell him this, m’lord. You tell him he’s bound on marching the wrong way. It's north he should be taking\nhis swords. North, not south.\n\nBran does not get to tell his brother this, because Robb takes his meal in the solar with the great lords to make final\nplans for the march, while Bran has to act as the host to the Karstarks in the \nGreat Hall\n. When he arrives in the hall,\nBran can feel the eyes on him and hears them murmuring about him being broken. He whispers under his breath that\nhe wants to be a knight, which Maester Luwin overhears. He tells Bran that some call his order the “knights of the\nmind,” and that Bran could forge a maester’s chain at the \nCitadel\n in \nOldtown\n. Bran states that he wants to learn\nmagic and that the \ncrow\n promised he would fly. The maester says he can teach Bran many things but no one can\nteach him magic. Bran replies that the \nchildren of the forest\n could teach him. Then he remembers what he promised\nOsha, and tells the maester of the threat in the north. The maester promises to talk to Osha, but it is obvious even to\nBran that what he has said has made little impression.\nTwo days later, Robb and his army march south. Robb tells Bran that now he must be the lord, the Stark in\nWinterfell. Bran—who has never felt so little, alone\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e762da7ced23f8b2a2d8a6b3306359159ecd3a499af991bc1273f7f2c36b9b1e_v2"}
