As they notice several faces carved into various trees\nalong the road, he comes to realize that the wildlings may have bent the knee to Stannis and feigned to embrace the\nLord of Light\n, but in their hearts they will never abandon the \nold gods\n.\nA riot nearly breaks out as Jon's men deliver rations to the wildlings, with many complaining about the small\namount of food they receive. Jon promises the wildings adequate food, shelter, and weapons if they help the \nNight's\nWatch\n defend the Wall, informing them that they have the choice: work with the Watch, or face the \nOthers\n alone. In\nspite of their misgivings, many wildlings agree to join, children, \nspearwives\n, and fighters alike, including \nHalleck\n,\nthe brother of \nHarma Dogshead\n. However, \nSigorn\n and the rest of the Thenns refuse the offer. When the rations are\nall distributed, the wagons are loaded with 63 wildings heading back to the Wall. Jon remembers something \nMance\nRayder\n told him, that the wildlings do not follow names or sigils. They follow strength.\nNavigation:\nJon IV\n↑\nReek II\n ←\nJon V\n→ \nTyrion VI\n↓\nJon VI\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 22: Tyrion VI\nPlace(s): \nSelhorys\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nDaenerys IV\n↓\nTyrion VII\nSynopsis\nTyrion is dreaming of his \nlord father\n and the \nShrouded Lord\n. In his dream, they are one and the same. He wakes up\nwith his mouth dry and rusty with the taste of blood and his heart hammering in his chest.\nTyrion learns that after being knocked overboard during the battle with the \nstone men\n, he was rescued by \nJon\nConnington\n and \nthe prince\n forbade the crew to throw him, near-dead, overboard. Tyrion is being treated with\nvinegar, to reduce the danger of an infection with \ngreyscale\n. Prince Aegon is also still aboard and irritated about it;\nhowever, his companions insisted on keeping him safe, as \nSelhorys\n, where the \nShy Maid\n is currently docked, fears\nan imminent attack by an approaching \nDothraki\n \nkhalasar\n and they do not want to get caught up in the chaos. To pass\nthe time, Tyrion goads Aegon into playing a game of \ncyvasse\n with him, using it as an opportunity to probe the boy\nfor information. Aegon asks Tyrion about his \nreal father\n, but Tyrion can tell him little; he himself only saw Rhaegar\nonce or twice before \nRobert's Rebellion\n, and was a small boy hidden away at \nCasterly Rock\n when Rhaegar died at\nthe Trident\n.\nTyrion learns from Aegon that the child murdered by \nGregor Clegane\n during the \nSack of King's Landing\n was a\ntanner's son\n from \nPisswater Bend\n whom Varys purchased and substituted for Aegon in the cradle. After the Sack,\nVarys smuggled the baby Aegon across the \nnarrow sea\n to \nIllyrio Mopatis\n, who made the arrangements for Aegon's\nupbringing. Tyrion jokes that it will make a good story for the singers when he returns to Westeros, assuming\nDaenerys Targaryen\n takes him as her consort. Aegon is stunned by this, having clearly never considered the\npossibility that Daenerys might refuse him. Tyrion points out that she is a proud, strong, and fierce young woman\nwho is unlikely to appreciate a relative coming to her with a begging bowl, certainly not one with a stronger claim to\nthe \nIron Throne\n than her own. Aegon angrily denies being a beggar, pointing out his own army, the \nGolden\nCompany\n. Tyrion responds that Daenerys has a larger army than his own and owes nothing to Aegon. Aegon\nprotests, trusting in Lord Connington to win her over. Tyrion calls him a fool, and gives him the following warning:\nTrust no one, my prince. Not your \nchainless maester\n, not your false father, not the gallant \nDuck\n or the lovely\nLemore\n nor these other fine friends who grew you up from a bean. Above all, trust not the cheesemonger, nor\nthe Spider, nor this little dragon queen you mean to marry. All this mistrust will sour your stomach and keep\nyou awake at night, ’tis true, but better that than the long sleep that does not end.\nTyrion then suggests a different course of action to Aegon: head to Westeros instead of going east, land in \nDorne\nand take advantage of all the problems caused by the \nWar of the Five Kings\n. He points out that the \nNorth\n is in a\nchaotic condition, the \nriverlands\n are devastated, while \nStannis Baratheon\n holds \nStorm's End\n and\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
