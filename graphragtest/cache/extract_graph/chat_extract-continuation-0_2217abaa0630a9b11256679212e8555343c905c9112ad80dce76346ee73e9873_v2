Sansa\ninsists that there is no fun in riding because there is nothing to see, but Arya is fascinated by all the new flowers and\nlandmarks and people they are seeing along the way. Sansa informs Arya that she has to come, asking why anyone\nwould want to ride a stinky horse when they could ride in the wheelhouse on pillows while eating lemon cakes and\nkeeping company with the queen. Arya replies that she does not even like the queen and still intends to go riding.\nSansa, giving up, leaves but Arya yells after her that Lady will not be allowed in the wheelhouse, which leaves\nSansa speechless.\nWhen she nears the camp, Sansa sees a crowd gathered around the wheelhouse; the \ncouncil\n has sent an honor guard\nfrom \nKing's Landing\n to accompany them the rest of the way. The party includes two knights in fine armour: a strong\nold man in white armor and a beautiful young man in green armor. There is also a gaunt, grim man that Sansa finds\nso terrifying that she backs right into \nSandor Clegane\n. Sansa kneels and hugs Lady and, next thing she knows, the\ntwo new arrivals are standing above her. Joffrey explains that the terrifying man is Ser \nIlyn Payne\n, the King's Justice\n(the royal executioner).\nThe white knight then introduces himself as Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n, Lord Commander of the \nKingsguard\n, but the green\nknight insists that she guess. Based on his age and his antlered helm, Sansa correctly deduces him to be the king's\nyoungest brother, Lord \nRenly Baratheon\n. Feeling more comfortable, Sansa apologizes to Ser Ilyn Payne, but the\nman does not speak. Once he has left, Joffrey explains that his tongue was ripped out by \nMad King Aerys\n.\nThe Queen says that she must speak with the councilors, and therefore must postpone the day with Myrcella.\nInstead, she asks Joffrey to entertain their guests—Sansa is overjoyed with the idea of a whole day with Joffrey.\nSansa offers to do whatever the prince wants, and when Joffrey suggest they go riding, Sansa gushes that she loves\nriding. Joffrey then suggests that it would be best to leave Lady and his dog, Sandor Clegane, behind. When Sansa\nquestions leaving Clegane behind Joffrey brandishes his sword, \nLion's Tooth\n.\nThey ride along the river, exploring the countryside until they draw near to the \nbattlefield\n where King \nRobert\n\ndefeated \nRhaegar Targaryen\n. Then they hear an odd sound, like wooden clattering, coming from nearby. In a nearby\nclearing, they find a boy and a girl play-fighting with sticks. The boy, taller and older than the girl, is winning.\nWhen the girl is disarmed by a smack on the hand, Sansa recognizes her as Arya. Joffrey laughs and the boy, a\nbutcher's boy named \nMycah\n, drops his stick. Joffrey begins to taunt Mycah and challenges him to a fight, sword\nagainst stick. Mycah insists that Arya asked him to fight her, which Sansa quickly realizes is the truth. Joffrey\nremains oblivious however, and goes so far as to prick the boy's cheek with his sword. Arya picks up her stick and\ntells Joffrey to leave Mycah alone. Joffrey insists that he will not hurt Mycah, much.\nWithout warning, Arya breaks her stick over the back of Joffrey's head. Mycah runs away while an enraged Joffrey\nstaggers but manages to catch a second blow from Arya on his sword, knocking the splintered stick from her hand.\nIgnoring Sansa's screams for them to stop, Arya throws a rock and hits Joffrey's horse, driving it away. Joffrey\nchases Arya with his sword until she is backed up against a tree. Suddenly Nymeria appears, savaging Joffrey's\nsword arm and forcing him to drop his sword. Arya calls Nymeria off and picks up Lion's Tooth while Joffrey lies\nwhimpering on the ground. The prince pleads to Arya not to hurt him. Arya throws the sword into the river before\nrunning off with Nymeria.\nOnce Arya is gone, Sansa goes to help Joffrey tenderly, but he snarls at her to leave and not touch him and Sansa\ncan see the contempt in his eyes.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n ←\nSansa I\n→ \nEddard III\n↓\nSansa II\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 16: Eddard III\nPlace(s): \nDarry\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard II\n↑\nSansa I\n ←\nEddard III\n→ \nBran III\n↓\nEddard IV\nArya\n and \nJoffrey\n tell King \nRobert\n very different stories concerning their \nfight\n near the \nTrident\n.
