He takes up a place at the \nLazy\nEel\n, a shady tavern, and listens to gossip as he tries to work out what the \nManderlys\n will do. He finds out that the\nFreys\n have come to \nWhite Harbor\n with the bones of Ser \nWendel Manderly\n and proposals of marriage for Lord\nManderly's granddaughters and that his other son, Ser \nWylis Manderly\n, is held captive by the \nLannisters\n.

After viewing a dance by his naked male and\nfemale slaves, they discuss Dany's situation since she left Qarth. Xaro is aware of the activities of the \nSons of the\nHarpy\n and flatteringly tells Daenerys that he fears for her safety. He scoffs at her attempts to abolish slavery in\nMeereen and tells her that the \nThirteen\n are willing to trade with the city - in slaves. He offers her thirteen galleys if\nshe leaves for \nWesteros\n immediately. Dany tells him she will have her men inspect the ships, and refuses his feigned\nadvances to her.\nShe also learns from Xaro Xhoan Daxos that \nPyat Pree\n and three other \nwarlocks\n sailed for \nPentos\n soon after she left\nthat city.\nThe next day at court, she refuses the desperate pleas of \nLord Ghael\n to defend \nAstapor\n against \nYunkai\n. The envoy\nspits at her refusal, claiming that Astapor will die without her help, and is thrown out by \nStrong Belwas\n. After\nassembling her council to hear the report of Admiral \nGroleo\n, she decides she cannot abandon Meereen to Yunkai'i.\nWhen she summons Xaro to tell him, his obsequiousness vanishes. He tells her she will die screaming and that he\nshould have killed her in Qarth. She has him thrown out of the palace, but the next day an emissary gives her a\nbloody glove - the Qartheen have declared war.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nDavos II\n ←\nDaenerys III\n→ \nJon IV\n↓\nDaenerys IV\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 17: Jon IV\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon III\n↑\nDaenerys III\n ←\nJon IV\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\nJon V\nSynopsis\nDuring an inspection of the stores, \nJon\n is informed by \nBowen Marsh\n and some other stewards that there is not\nenough to feed the \nNight's Watch\n, the \nwildlings\n, and \nStannis\n' men through the winter.
