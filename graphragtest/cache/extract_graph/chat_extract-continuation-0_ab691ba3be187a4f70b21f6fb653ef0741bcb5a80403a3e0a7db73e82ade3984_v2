Tyrion asks if\nChataya can be trusted, and Varys explains she has no love for the queen and is grateful to be rid of \nAllar Deem\n.\nWhen Tyrion asks how the brothel came to have a secret entrance, Varys explains that the tunnel was dug for\nanother Hand who would not enter the house openly.\nEmerging into a stable, Varys helps disguise Tyrion as child and saddle a horse. Tyrion tells him that Stannis has\naccused Jaime and Cersei of incest, and asks how he came by that suspicion. Varys responds that perhaps someone\nwhispered it to him, or else he simply looked at color of a bastard's hair as \nJon Arryn\n and \nEddard Stark\n did; after all,\neach of the eight bastards of King \nRobert\n that Varys knows had black hair regardless of their mother's color. Tyrion\nwonders if the whisper might have come from Littlefinger, but Varys refuses to confirm.

Each has business to discuss, and many are\ninterested in wedding Lady \nDonella Hornwood\n, whose \nhusband\n and \nonly son\n have died in the south. Lady\nHornwood herself is concerned that \nRamsay Snow\n, the bastard of \nthe Dreadfort\n, means to seize her lands. The night\nCley Cerwyn\n arrives with news that \nStannis\n has declared \nJoffrey\n a bastard, Bran dreams of a \ngolden man\n throwing\nhim from a tower.\nSynopsis\nBran\n is awake long before dawn. \nWinterfell\n is full of guests for the \nharvest feast\n, and he must play the prince. He\nalways wanted to be a \nknight\n, not a prince, but now that he is broken he must spend his days listening to old men\ndiscuss things he barely understands. Lord \nWyman Manderly\n arrived from \nWhite Harbor\n two day ago, and Bran\nwelcomed him from \nhis father\n's high seat. Afterward, Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n said he had done well, but Manderly was\nonly the first. Many lords with matters to discuss with their overlord will use the feast as a pretext.\nHodor\n arrives to help him dress. Bran prefers to dress himself, but some things are just quicker with help. Bran is\nastonished by Hodor's deftness and strength and says he could have been a great knight if the gods had left him his\nwits. Mounting into his basket, Bran instructs Hodor to carry him downstairs.\nOut in the yard, Bran watches the Walders jousting against quintains. Bran notes that \nLittle Walder\n struck harder,\nbut \nBig Walder\n sat his horse better. When Little Walder sees Bran on Hodor's back, he remarks that Hodor is an\nugly horse, which angers Bran. The Walders continue to insult Hodor and Little Walder begins bumping him with\nhis horse. Bran grows angrier and threatens to sic \nSummer\n on them, but Little Walder points out he is wearing armor\nand says he wants a wolfskin cloak. Then, \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n arrives to break up the argument and chastise the\nWalders. Big Walder has the grace to look ashamed, but Little Walder remains haughty. Luwin reminds them that\ngood lords protect the weak and warns them to stay out of the \ngodswood\n. He then calls on Bran to come with him to\nmeet Lord Wyman.\nThe maester tells Bran he was right to defend Hodor, but it should not have been necessary to fetch him to meet\nLord Wyman. Bran apologizes and asks if they will talk of the \nwar\n. Luwin reminds Bran that he is only eight and\nshould not speak unless spoken to. Inside, Bran is seated in his father's chair with Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik\nbeside him. The morbidly obese Lord Wyman Manderly is very pleasant, insisting no prince is ever late. He talks\nabout White Harbor being the best place to mint currency and build a fleet for Robb's new kingdom. Talk of\nwarships piques Bran's interest and he thinks it a splendid idea, but no one asks him. The meeting continues through\nlunch, during which Lord Wyman inquires about his widowed cousin Lady \nDonella Hornwood\n, whose \nhusband\n and\nonly son\n died on the \nGreen Fork\n and in the \nWhispering Wood\n. He suggests that he would be\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Tyrion<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion is a character who interacts with Varys and is
