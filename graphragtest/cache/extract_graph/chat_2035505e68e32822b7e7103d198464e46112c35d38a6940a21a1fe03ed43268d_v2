And later I dreamt that maid again,\nslaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.\" Suddenly, she spots \nArya\n, and calls her \"blood child\" and \"dark\nheart\", bidding her to leave. When Beric explains to the old dwarf woman that Arya is being brought to \nRiverrun\n,\nshe tells them to seek \nher mother\n at the \nTwins\n, for there is to be a wedding. She then demands a song as payment for\nher dreams, the same song she always requests from \nTom\n; \nJenny of Oldstones\n.\nLater, Arya speaks with \nEdric Dayne\n, who is called Ned like \nher father\n. Edric tells her that he saw her father during\nthe Hand's tourney\n while he squired for Lord Beric. He reveals that Beric was promised to \nhis aunt\n, “but that was\nbefore he died”, Arya thinks to herself. Ned tells her of \nWylla\n, his \nwet nurse\n, who he says is the mother of \nJon\nSnow\n. She has been in the service of the \nDaynes\n for years, and Ned is surprised that Arya’s father never spoke of\nher nor of \nAshara\n, Ned’s aunt. He tells Arya that her father and Ashara fell in love during the \ntourney at Harrenhal\n,\nand that she killed herself after the war because her heart was broken. Arya does not believe the young Lord of\nStarfall\n, believing her father only loved her mother. She asks \nHarwin\n about it, and he confirms that Eddard and\nAshara may have fallen in love at Harrenhal, but at that time his brother \nBrandon\n was betrothed to Catelyn. He\nclaims that Ashara killed herself over grief for \nher brother\n, and tells Arya \"Let it lie, my lady. They’re dead, all of\nthem.\"\nWhen the outlaws come upon a ruined village, Arya thinks the \nLannisters\n destroyed it, but she is told that the village\nwas destroyed years before by Hoster Tully, because Lord \nGoodbrook\n, the lord of the village, had fought for the\nTargaryens\n during \nRobert's Rebellion\n. Later, Thoros sees in his flames that Riverrun will soon come under attack by\nthe Lannisters again, and he believes the ghost’s dream that Catelyn and Robb are at the Twins. That night, Arya\nsneaks off while everyone else is asleep, feeling that the outlaws cannot be her pack if they want to ransom her off to\nher \nbrother\n, mother, or uncle \nBrynden\n. However, she is captured by \nthe Hound\n while racing through the woods.\nNavigation:\nArya VII\n↑\nDaenerys IV\n ←\nArya VIII\n→ \nJaime VI\n↓\n\nArya IX\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 44: Jaime VI\nPlace(s): \nHarrenhal\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime V\n↑\nArya VIII\n ←\nJaime VI\n→ \nCatelyn V\n↓\nJaime VII\nSynopsis\nRoose Bolton\n has left \nHarrenhal\n to the \nGoat\n, but before marching for \nthe Twins\n he told \nJaime\n to give his warm\nregards to \nhis father\n.

He sees the shades of the other knights of the \nKingsguard\n as well as Prince \nRhaegar\n, come to judge him for\nkilling \nAerys\n. After the fire of his sword goes out, Brienne’s continues to burn, defending him from the shades.\nWhen Jaime awakens, he commands Walton to return to Harrenhal saying that he \"forgot something\". Back at\nHarrenhal, the goat’s men open the gates, and Jaime finds that Brienne has been tossed into the bear pit with only a\ntourney sword.\nVargo Hoat, with a bandage around his face from where Brienne bit off his ear, will not pull the woman up. Jaime\njumps into the pit to save Brienne, and holds off the bear long enough for Walton’s men to fill it with quarrels. The\nMummers\n are unable to stop them because Steelshanks' escort of 200 men outnumbers them two to one.\nVargo asks Jaime to tell his father that he had been merciful, and the Kingslayer promises that the goat will receive\nhis ransom.
