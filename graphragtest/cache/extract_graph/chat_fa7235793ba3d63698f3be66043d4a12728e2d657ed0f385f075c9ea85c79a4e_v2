The only real threat is\nthat the \nStarks\n or \nArryns\n will interfere.\nTyrion tells them they need not worry about the Arryns, but the Starks are another matter. He is informed of \nEddard\nStark\n’s arrest and that \nRobb Stark\n has called the Stark banners. Tywin remains unperturbed, declaring that Robb is\nonly a child. When Tyrion questions how \nCersei\n has convinced King \nRobert\n to imprison his dear friend Ned, he\nlearns that the king is dead and \nJoffrey\n now reigns. Tyrion immediately understands that his sister is the true ruler\nand knows that things will be very different.\nTyrion is then offered a command in the army: he is to handle \nMarq Piper\n and \nKaryl Vance\n, who have been raiding\nJaime’s supply trains across the \nRed Fork\n, and \nBeric Dondarrion\n, who has been harassing Tywin’s forging parties.\nTyrion is not impressed with this command of perhaps 20 men, so he reveals to his father he has a promise to keep:\nweapons and armor for 3,000 clansmen and wagons to carry them.\nThen the door opens with a crash as the Captain of the Guard flies across the room. Shagga stamps in, followed by\nthe other clansmen. Lord Tywin coolly asks who they are and Tyrion explains that they followed him and he wants\nto keep them. The clansmen insist that free men have the right to sit on war councils. Once Tyrion has introduced\nthe clansmen, he introduces his father, complete with all his titles. Lord Tywin claims that even in the \nwesterlands\nthey have heard of the prowess of the mountain clans, and asks what brings them here. The reply is horses, silk, and\nsteel.\nIt is then that news arrives that Robb Stark’s host is coming down the \nkingsroad\n. Lord Tywin is pleased that he will\nbe given such an easy chance to defeat House Stark so he can turn his attention towards \nStannis Baratheon\n. He gives\norders that Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n fall back to draw the northerners further south, harassing them along the way.\nAfter ordering the army assembled, Tywin compliments the clansmen’s fearless reputation and promises that if they\nfight for him he will provide them with all that Tyrion promised them and more. The clansmen insist that they are\nbeing promised what is already owed. Tywin quickly covers by claiming that his words were a courtesy and that his\nboldest knights fear to face the northerners. \nTimett\n takes the bait and declares that the \nBurned Men\n fear nothing.\nWith the Burned Men agreeing, all the other clans agree, but only if Tyrion accompanies them into battle until the\npromises he made them are honored.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VI\n↑\nCatelyn VIII\n ←\nTyrion VII\n→ \nSansa V\n↓\nTyrion VIII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 57: Sansa V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa IV\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nSansa V\n→ \nEddard XV\n↓\nSansa VI\nSansa\n attends \nJoffrey\n’s first court session as king. After an official call for all the noble houses to pledge their fealty,\nthe \nsmall council\n announces a number of new appointments. When he is dismissed from the \nKingsguard\n, Ser\nBarristan Selmy\n storms out. In his place, \nthe Hound\n is appointed to the Kingsguard. Finally, Sansa comes forward to\nask for leniency for \nher father\n, and it is agree that mercy will be granted if he confesses and names Joffrey the true\nking.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n attends King \nJoffrey\n’s first court session. As a reward for being good and promising not to leave the \nRed\nKeep\n, Sansa has been granted freedom of the castle by Queen \nCersei\n. However, even Sansa realizes that it is an\nempty honor since she cannot get past the guards in any case, and has nowhere to go if she did. In addition, the\nqueen has attached an “honor guard” to accompany Sansa everywhere.\nThe throne room has been stripped of all the hunting tapestries that King \nRobert\n loved so well. Sansa also notes that\nthere are no smallfolk and only perhaps twenty of the hundred lords accustomed to wait on King Robert. Sansa\nwonders where the others have all gone. As she passes among them, many of the men pretend not to know her and\nnone will meet her eyes.\nJoffrey and Cersei are announced by a herald and enter escorted by members of the \nKingsguard\n. Once he is seated\non the \nIron Throne\n, Joffrey declares that it is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and reward the faithful and asks\nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n to read his royal decrees. The list of those that must present themselves to swear fealty goes\non for a long time. Finally, near the end, the names of Sansa’s own \nfamily\n are called, even down to \nArya\n and\nRickon\n. The naming of Arya suggests to Sansa that her sister must have escaped and be safe in \nWinterfell\n.\nIt is then announced that the king’s grandfather, Lord \nTywin Lannister\n is to take\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fa7235793ba3d63698f3be66043d4a12728e2d657ed0f385f075c9ea85c79a4e_v2"}
