Lord Tywin tells his daughter to leave, which she does\nseethingly. Tyrion proposes that, rather than following his father's footsteps, Joffrey will become \"\nAerys\n the Third\".\nLord Tywin responds that he is only thirteen and still has time to grow, yet Tyrion notices that his father is more\nupset than he wants to show. Lord Tywin announces that Joffrey needs a hard lesson, reminding Tyrion of the \nhard\nlesson his father gave him when he was the same age\n, which almost makes him feel sorry for Joffrey. However,\nTyrion can't think of anyone who'd deserve it more than Joffrey.\nTyrion gets back to the business of war. He congratulates his father, asking him how long he had been plotting with\nLord Walder. Lord Tywin objects to his son's choice of words. Tyrion retorts that he doesn't enjoy being left in the\ndark. His father explains that nobody was told who didn't play a part in the execution, including Cersei, stressing\nhow important it is to keep secrets, especially in \nKing’s Landing\n. He wanted to get rid of a dangerous enemy as\ncheaply as possible and that has been achieved, he announces, also suggesting that, while Tyrion has some talent for\ncunning, he simply talks too much and his loose tongue will be his undoing one day. Tyrion jests that he should have\nlet Joffrey rip his tongue out then and Lord Tywin says he shouldn't tempt him.\nThe discussion moves on to the Dornish issue. Lord Tywin considers the presence of \nOberyn Martell\n unfortunate,\ndescribing him as half-mad while he believes \nDoran Martell\n to be a reasoned man who weighs the consequences of\nwords and actions. Tyrion asks whether it is true that Oberyn tried to continue \nthe war\n on behalf of \nViserys\nTargaryen\n. Lord Tywin confirms it, recounting how \nJon Arryn\n's negotiations with Prince Doran in \nSunspear\n put an\n\nend to the conspiracy with both sides deciding to remain silent about the issue afterwards, but distrust between King\nRobert and House Martell remained. Tyrion proposes that showing Oberyn around in the brothels of the city could\nease the Red Viper's impatience, jesting that he won't be accused of not serving House Lannister where he is needed\nmost. Lord Tywin finds this comment very droll and asks whether Tyrion wants motley to be sewn for him,\nprompting Tyrion's question as to whether he would be allowed to say anything he wants about King Joffrey if he\nwore it. Lord Tywin declares that, while he had to suffer \nhis father's\n follies, he won't suffer his son's.\nTyrion is more serious now, predicting that Oberyn will not be pleasant, nor satisfied with only receiving Gregor\nClegane's head. Lord Tywin reveals that he has no intention of sacrificing the Mountain, as he has served House\nLannister well and nobody is dreaded as much by their enemies. Tyrion is shocked; he thought that he and his father\nagreed that the woods are full of beasts and that even Ser Gregor is disposable. He points out that Oberyn knows it\nwas the Mountain who killed his sister and her children. Oberyn knows nothing and has no proof, Lord Tywin\nreplies, he merely heard rumors and Ser Gregor is not likely to confirm them, in particular as Tywin will keep him\naway for as long as the Dornishmen are in the city. If Oberyn raises the issue, Lord Tywin will claim the murderer\nwas Ser \nAmory Lorch\n – and the tale of Ser Amory's gruesome death by the hands of a bear set on him by \nVargo\nHoat\n would even appease Oberyn, he expects. Tyrion objects to his father's sense of justice, but Tywin tells him that\nit was in fact Ser Amory who found and killed Rhaegar's daughter \nRhaenys\n, also revealing that the child's mother\nand baby brother \nAegon\n were in the nursery below at the time. When Tyrion asks what he is going to tell Oberyn if\nhe inquires who gave the order for the murders, Lord Tywin answers that Ser Amory acted on his own in an attempt\nto win the favor of the new king, as Robert's hatred of Rhaegar was well known. Thinking about it, Tyrion has to\nconcede that this version might serve its purpose, although he suspects that the Red Viper will not be happy.\nTyrion's suggestion that it would have been better for his father to let Robert commit the murders himself prompts\nan astonished Lord Tywin to share his reasoning at the time of the \nSack of King’s Landing\n. He explains that they\ncame late to Robert’s cause, so they had to demonstrate their loyalty. When Tywin laid the bodies at the throne, it\nwas clear they had forsaken House Targaryen, and Robert was clearly relieved, knowing that Rhaegar’s children had\nto die for his throne to be secure, but not wanting to kill them himself. Tywin admits that it was done too brutally,\nand Elia did not need to be harmed. The Mountain only killed her because Tywin did not tell him to spare her.\nTywin asserts that at the time, he had greater concerns than the Dornish princess\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a5484fe15b0bdf98bb8f979280b69c8fa40d2adf459c14b4efcbb360c395fe11_v2"}
