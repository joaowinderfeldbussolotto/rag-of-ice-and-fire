Marillion shrieks when a rider leaps over them. When the rider turns, Tyrion charges and cuts\nthe horse’s neck so that the rider and his horse fall together on top of Marillion. Tyrion then buries his axe in the\nman’s neck and uses this opportunity to crush Marillion’s fingers with a boot.\nFor the rest of the battle, Tyrion keeps on the fringes, leaping out to cut at the legs of horses and kill wounded men,\ntaking a helm from one. Tyrion watches Jyck get himself killed, then comes across Kurleket’s body and helps\nhimself to the man’s dagger. Then he hears a woman scream. Tyrion goes to aid Lady Catelyn even as he thinks that\nhe should let them have her. Tyrion gets the first man in the knee and Catelyn kills a second as he reels from a blow\nby Tyrion. The third man makes a quick retreat, and the fighting is over.\nAs Bronn helps himself to Jyck’s boots, he asks if this is Tyrion's first fight, which Tyrion confirms. Bronn then tells\nhim that he needs a woman now; nothing like a woman after a man’s been bloodied. Glancing over to Lady Catelyn,\nwho is dressing Ser Rodrik’s wound, Tyrion quips that he is willing if she is.\nLooking over the dead clansmen, Tyrion notes that they are thin, ragged men with unimpressive weapons. The\nleader in the shadowskin cloak is not near as big or terrifying as he seemed now that the cloak is gone, and his great\nsword turns out to be notched and poorly made. They have only three dead: the \nBracken\n men-at-arms \nMohor\n and\nKurleket, and Tyrion’s man Jyck. Tyrion remembers Jyck’s bareback charge and thinks of him as a fool to the end.\nSer Willis Wode urges that they must proceed in haste before more clansmen arrive, but Lady Catelyn wishes to\npause to bury the dead. When Ser Willis points out that the soil is too stony for graves Catelyn suggest they gather\nstones for cairns. Bronn tells Catelyn that she can do as she likes, but that he and Chiggen have better things to do\nthan pile rocks, such as breathing. When Ser Rodrik agrees with Bronn, an angry Lady Catelyn agrees and they ride\n\non. Now there are plenty of horses. As Tyrion mounts Jyck’s horse, Lharys demands the dirk Tyrion took from\nKurleket’s body, but Catelyn intercedes, telling them to give him back his axe as well.\nTyrion is pleased to learn that Marillion the singer has broken several ribs, four fingers, and lost his harp. Tyrion is\nless pleased to find Marillion has also acquired the magnificent shadowskin cloak. The singer, for once, has nothing\nto say, and Tyrion can see him cringe when they hear shadowcats fighting over the bodies they left behind. He trots\nup to the singer and taunts that “craven” rhymes nicely with “raven.” Then he moves up to ride next to Lady\nCatelyn. Picking up the conversation from before their interruption, Tyrion points out that there is a serious flaw in\nLittlefinger’s story: he \nnever\n bets against his family.\nNavigation:\nTyrion III\n↑\nEddard VII\n ←\nTyrion IV\n→ \nArya III\n↓\nTyrion V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 32: Arya III\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya II\n↑\nTyrion IV\n ←\nArya III\n→ \nEddard VIII\n↓\nArya IV\nArya\n is chasing a cat when \nMyrcella\n and \nTommen\n discover her. She escapes unidentified, but finds herself in the\ndungeons. There she overhears two men talking about killing \nher father\n. After eventually finding her way out she\ntries to tell her father what she heard but he does not believe her.\nSynopsis\nArya\n is chasing a one-eared \nblack tomcat\n as part of her training with \nSyrio Forel\n. Arya has found that catching cats\nis hard; half-healed scratches cover her hands and her knees are scabbed from tumbles. At first, even the fat kitchen\ncat could avoid her. As she stalks the black tom, Arya recalls when she originally went to Syrio with her hand\nbleeding. He told her she was too slow and that her enemies would give her more than scratches. The castle is full of\ncats, all of which she has caught and brought to Syrio, except for this one, which a \ngold cloak\n claimed was older\nthan sin and twice as mean; it had even snatched a quail from Lord \nTywin\n’s fingers once. Arya has chased the cat all\nover the castle and she does not know where she is, but she has finally cornered the cat in a narrow alley.\nThe tomcat tries to dart between her legs, but Arya catches it. As she excitedly hugs the cat to her chest and gives it\na kiss, she is interrupted. Princess \nMyrcella\n, at the end of the alley, asks what “that boy” is doing with that cat.
