He looks again at\nthe assassin’s dagger and wonders if it has some connection to the mystery of Arryn’s death. Could Robert be part of\nit? He remembers Catelyn telling him that he knew the man but the king is someone different. Ned summons Poole\nback and tells him to find a fast ship with a good captain, quietly but quickly; if he could find a ship tomorrow, it\nwould be best to be on it.\nTomard\n announces the arrival of Littlefinger. Ned is tempted to send him away, but thinks better of it. Littlefinger\ninforms Ned that he has managed to convince the council to offer a lordship to any man who kills Daenerys rather\nthan hire the Faceless Men. When Ned criticizes the principle of giving titles to assassins, Littlefinger points out that\nhe actually did Daenerys more good than Ned did; if a \nFaceless Man\n were to be sent against the girl she would be as\ngood as buried, whereas this way some idiot will likely botch the job and put the Dothraki on their guard.\nNed is incredulous; Littlefinger supported the proposal but now expects him to believe that he was defending the\ngirl. Littlefinger then calls Ned an enormous fool who rules like a man dancing on rotten ice. Ned insists that he has\nhad his fill of politics. Littlefinger then says that if Ned is still in the city this evening he will take him to the \nbrothel\nhis men have been searching for so ineffectually.\nNavigation:\nEddard VII\n↑\nArya III\n ←\nEddard VIII\n→ \nCatelyn VI\n↓\nEddard IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 34: Catelyn VI\nPlace(s): \nThe \nBloody Gate\n - The \nEyrie\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn V\n↑\nEddard VIII\n ←\nCatelyn VI\n→ \nEddard IX\n↓\nCatelyn VII\nCatelyn\n and her party finally reach the \nBloody Gate\n and safety. At her sister’s request, Catelyn makes the dangerous\nnight ascent to the \nEyrie\n to meet \nLysa\n and her sickly son, \nRobert\n.\nSynopsis\nAs they approach the \nBloody Gate\n, Ser \nDonnel Waynwood\n tells \nCatelyn\n that she should have sent word before\ncoming because the \nhigh road\n is no longer safe. Catelyn replies that they learned that to their sorrow, reflecting on\nthe six men who died to bring her this far; three in the \nfirst attack\n, \nLharys\n and \nChiggen\n in the second, and \nMorrec\n of\na festering wound. Only Ser \nRodrik\n, \nBronn\n, \nMarillion\n, Ser \nWillis Wode\n, \nTyrion Lannister\n, and Catelyn herself\nremain. They had been sure they were all doomed when Waynwood’s men approached.\nSer Donnel goes on to explain that since \nJon Arryn\n’s death the \nVale mountain clans\n have grown bolder and Lady\nLysa\n has forbade sending men out to fight them, though no one is sure why. Catelyn chooses not to mention that it is\nLannisters\n her sister fears. Looking back at Tyrion, Catelyn notes the dwarf’s confidence in the presence of a large\nparty of men sworn to \nHouse Arryn\n and wonders again if she is wrong to suspect him. She is also unsettled by the\ncunning of the man; although he remains her prisoner, the dwarf now rides freely, armed with a dirk and an axe and\nwearing the \nshadowskin\n cloak he won gambling with Marillion.\nCatelyn asks Ser Donnel to send for \nMaester\n \nColemon\n when they arrive to treat a badly injured Ser Rodrik. She is\ntold that her sister has forbidden the maester to leave the \nEyrie\n because of her concern for her son \nRobert\n’s health.\nAll that Ser Donnel can promise is the attention of a \nsepton\n who tends to the garrison.\nWhen they arrive at the Bloody Gate, they are met by Catelyn’s uncle, Ser \nBrynden Tully\n, known as the Blackfish.\nOnce they have passed through the Gate, Catelyn can see the richness of the \nVale of Arryn\n spread out before her and\nthe peak known as the \nGiant's Lance\n rising miles above the valley floor. Her uncle points out the faint glimmer of\nthe seven towers of the Eyrie on the side of the mountain and says that they can reach the foot of the Lance by\nevening.\nWhen Ser Rodrik declares that he cannot go any farther, Catelyn decides to leave the rest of her party behind.\nMarillion the singer asks to accompany her to the castle. Catelyn, who cannot understand how Marillion survived\nthe journey which killed so many others, agrees. Then Bronn, whose ferocious fighting helped cut their path to\nsafety, declares that he is also coming. Catelyn dislikes the sellsword because of his lack of kindness and loyalty,\nand would prefer to separate the sellsword from his fast friend Tyrion Lannister.
