Jon Connington joined the Golden Company after his own defeat at the \nBattle of the Bells\n, at\nStoney Sept\n, when he failed to capture the then-rebel \nRobert Baratheon\n, seventeen years ago. It is revealed that\nConnington was dismissed from the Golden Company for ostensibly stealing from their war chest, but in reality left\ntheir service as part of a plan staged by Lord \nVarys\n to make his ignominious dismissal more forgettable. The\nCompany was previously led by Connington's close friend Toyne but now it is led by \"Homeless\" \nHarry Strickland\n,\na man skilled in negotiating lucrative contracts but cowardly facing combat, in the eyes of Connington.\nAfter presenting the young Griff as Prince Aegon Targaryen, son of the late Prince \nRhaegar Targaryen\n, to the\nhighest-ranking members of the Company, the officers, including Connington, voice their lack of enthusiasm for the\ncomplicated situation. They did not anticipate that Daenerys would decide to remain in \nMeereen\n instead of marching\nout to meet her enemies and joining with them. Strickland reveals that the Golden Company has received a large\nnumber of alternative offers, including some which would involve them joining the coalition currently arrayed\nagainst \nDaenerys Targaryen\n. They also bemoan the constantly-changing plans of \nIllyrio Mopatis\n and Varys, who did\nnot anticipate \nViserys Targaryen\n's death or that Daenerys would go to Slaver's Bay rather than \nWesteros\n. Seeing\ntheir disillusionment and an opportunity to claim the Iron Throne for his own, Prince Aegon offers them an\nalternative, earlier proposed by Tyrion: He does not wish to try to rally Daenerys and her dragons, but instead to sail\nto Westeros with the hope of obtaining support from \nDorne\n in accordance with \nDoran Martell\n's own plan for\navenging Princess \nElia Martell\n. Aegeon reasons that once he and the Golden Company have begun the rebellion,\nDaenerys will cross the \nNarrow Sea\n to join him. This proposal is met with great enthusiasm from the officers, except\nHarry Strickland, who nevertheless has no choice but to comply.\nOnce agreed on the new plan, Aegon is taken on a tour of the mercenary camp. Connington retires to his quarters,\nsatisfied with the new situation and impressed with a side of Aegon he has not previously seen. He hopes to return\nhome to the castle of his ancestors and repay his debt to his old friend Rhaegar. It is then revealed that he is slowly\nsuccumbing to \ngreyscale\n (presumably acquired during the attack by the Stone Men), which is beginning to spread in\nhis hand - he hopes that he will live several more years to see his ward sit the Iron Throne.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys IV\n ←\nThe Lost Lord\n→ \nThe Windblown\n↓\nThe Griffin Reborn\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 25: The Windblown\nPlace(s): \nSlaver's Bay\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Merchant's Man\n↑\nThe Lost Lord\n ←\nThe Windblown\n→ \nThe Wayward Bride\n↓\nThe Spurned Suitor\nSynopsis\nQuentyn Martell\n and his two companions have joined the \nWindblown\n, a sellsword company of two thousand people\nled by a \nPentoshi\n noble known\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3a516238c89c36718f20a65d67a26b204ef323ed42425abc6e2d173977e5af12_v2"}
