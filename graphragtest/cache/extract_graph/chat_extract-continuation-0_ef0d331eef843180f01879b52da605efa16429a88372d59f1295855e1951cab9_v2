Tyrion\nfeigns ignorance of him being in the city, blaming Bronn for making his friend that he walked \nThe Wall\n with wait.\nSer Alliser wants to speak to the king, but is told he is playing with his new crossbow (which Tyrion has just given\nhim), so Ser Alliser will have to talk with the King’s servants.\nSer Alliser relates how they found the corpses of two long dead rangers, and brought them back to the Wall. They\nrose that night and killed Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n and attempted to murder Ser \nJeor Mormont\n. Tyrion gets assurances that\nthe Lord Commander survived and they killed these two dead men. Ser Alliser tells them that they were dead the\nfirst time, pale and cold with black hands and feet. As proof he had a hand, but it rotted away while he waited.\nTyrion thinks of the dread he felt when he was on the Wall with \nJon Snow\n. He orders Littlefinger to send Ser Alliser\nback with 100 spades to bury the dead and prevent them from walking, and also tells Ser Jacelyn that Ser Alliser\nwill have the pick of the dungeons to use the spades. Tyrion is informed that the dungeons are near empty since\nYoren\n has already taken all the likely men. He tells Ser Jacelyn to arrest some more, or to spread the word that there\nis food at the wall. Ser Alliser is not easily dismissed, trying to warn Tyron of the danger. Ser Preston intervenes,\nand Ser Alliser knows better than to challenge a Kingsguard. Then, Bronn marches Ser Alliser from the hall.\nVarys compliments Tyrion on how he handled the situation. Littlefinger asks if he meant to send away all his\nguards, to which Tyrion responds only his sister’s guards. Tryion notes that Littlefinger is not happy with him, and\nLittlefinger replies that he loves him as much as ever but that Myrcella Baratheon cannot wed \nRobert Arryn\n if she\nweds Trystane Martell, and to leave him out of the next deception. Glancing at the knife at Littlefinger’s hip, Tyrion\napologizes, stating the realm needs him.\nTyrion asks Varys to walk with him. Varys tells him that Cersei will never let him send away her guard, and Tyrion\nreplies that Varys is going to help him accomplish this by saying it is part of the plan to free Jaime. Varys is to put\nthe thief, the poisoner, the mummer, and the murderer in crimson cloaks to join the rest of the guard escorting Ser\nCleos—four among 400 Lannister men cannot be watched closely. She will not like it and be uneasy, but Tyrion\nlikes her uneasy.\nSer Cleos leaves that afternoon, escorted by 100 Lannister guardsmen. That same afternoon, Tyrion finds \nTimett\ndicing in the barracks and tells him to meet him in his solar at midnight. He feasts with the \nVale mountain clans\n that\nnight, shunning wine for once. During the feast he asks \nShagga\n what moon it is and is told black, which they call the\ntraitor’s moon. He tells Shagga to not get too drunk and to keep his axe sharp.\nShagga uses his axe to destroy the door to Pycelle’s chambers. Tyrion has Timett pull the naked serving girl out of\nthe bed and march/drag her into the hall. Tyrion pulls the blanket off the maester, who asks why this is being done to\na loyal servant. Tyrion tells him that he sent one of his letters to \nDoran Martell\n and the other to Cersei. Pycelle tries\nto blame Varys, but Tyrion informs him that he was the only one he entrusted the information with. Pycelle tries to\nclaim that something happened to the letter on the way, and that he knows things about Varys that would chill\nTyrion's blood. Tyrion replies that his lady prefers his blood hot. Then, Pycelle tries to accuse Littlefinger, to which\nTyrion responds that he already knows about him. Tyrion instructs Shagga to cut off Pycelle's manhood and feed it\nto the goats. When Shagga states there are no goats, Tyrion tells him to make do. Shagga first takes most of\nPycelle’s beard with his axe as Pycelle sprays everything with urine. Pycelle tells Tyrion that he did everything for\nHouse Lannister and to ask \nTywin\n; he says he was even responsible for convincing \nAerys II Targaryen\n to open the\ngates. Tyrion, shocked, states “So the Sack of King’s Landing was your work as well?” He then asks him how many\nhe has betrayed: Aerys, \nEddard Stark\n, himself, King \nRobert\n, \nJon Arryn\n, Prince \nRhaegar\n? Pycelle pleads that Robert\nwas a wretched king, that \nRenly\n was plotting to bring \nMace Tyrell\n’s \ndaughter\n to court and have Cersei supplanted as\nQueen. Tyrion asks what Lord Arryn had been plotting, and Pycelle explains that Jon Arryn knew of Cersei’s incest.\nPycelle also knew that Lord Jon planned to send \nhis wife\n back to the Eyrie, \nhis son\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SER ALLISER THORNE<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch who complains about being ignored
