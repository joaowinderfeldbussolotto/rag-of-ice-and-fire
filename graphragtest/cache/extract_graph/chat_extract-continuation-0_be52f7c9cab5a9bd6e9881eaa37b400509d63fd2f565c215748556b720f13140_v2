The Blackfish is aware of the oath Jaime swore to \nCatelyn\n, but the member of the \nKingsguard\n makes it\nknown he does not have the \nStark\n girls. He offers \nEdmure Tully\n in exchange for Lady \nSybell Spicer\n and her\nchildren, but Brynden refuses, telling him he swore to \nhis king\n to keep \nhis wife\n safe and won't hand her over to a\nFrey noose. Jaime responds that the girl has been pardoned and no harm will come to her, nor anyone else if\nBrynden yields Riverrun; they will be free to go or \ntake the black\n as they choose, but Brynden dismisses the offer,\nclaiming that he and his men would rather die with swords in their hands than \n\"be paraded through \nKing's Landing\nto die like \nEddard Stark\n\"\n. Brynden adds that he is well provisioned for a siege and the Lannister and Frey casualties\nwill be far higher than his own if they storm Riverrun.\nThe Blackfish also makes it clear that he believes Lord \nTywin\n had a hand in the \nRed Wedding\n, though that will\nnever absolve the \nFreys\n for their breach of the sacred laws of hospitality. Jaime challenges the older knight to single\ncombat, with each choosing a champion. When Brynden prods Jaime to face him himself, Jaime cannot help but rise\nto the bait. But the Blackfish is not so foolish as to trust that Jaime's terms would be honored. The parley over, Jaime\nrides back to his camp and calls his captains for a war council, resolved that he must break his vow to Lady Catelyn\nand storm Riverrun.\nThe lords of the \nriverlands\n who have bent the knee to the \nIron Throne\n do not tolerate the Freys' presence at the war\ncouncil. Ser \nRyman\n is too drunk to attend, but \nEdwyn\n and \nBastard Walder\n are present. When confronted by Lord\nClement Piper\n as to the condition of his son, Ser \nMarq\n, Edwyn replies that he is still held at the \nTwins\n to ensure that\nPinkmaiden\n is truly loyal to the Iron Throne. When Bastard Walder and Lord Clement nearly come to blows when\nPiper challenges Edwyn to a duel over a threat to Lord Clement's heir, Jaime silences them, ending the council\nprematurely. Lord Clement storms out, and Lord Vance explains to Jaime that as well as his first born son, several of\nLord Clement's cousins and nephews accompanied Marq to the Twins, and are either captives or dead. When Edwyn\ndenounces them as traitors and rebels, Jaime coldly retorts that the Freys first rebelled against the Crown with Robb\nStark and then betrayed him, making them twice the traitors House Piper are. Jaime takes enjoyment out of watching\nEdwyn's smug attitude evaporate at that remark.\nSummoning Ser \nIlyn Payne\n and Ser \nLyle Crakehall\n, Jaime heads straight for the Frey camp. He first has Payne cut\nloose Edmure Tully, and when Edwyn and his father, Ser Ryman, come forth to protest, he warns them to keep\nquiet. When Ryman persists, stating that he is the heir to the Crossing, Jaime punches him in the face with his\ngolden hand. He then dismisses Ryman back to the Twins, sick of the man's whoring and drinking, and takes the\nbladed crown that his whore wears. When Jaime places Edwyn in charge of the Freys, Jaime witnesses a glimpse of\nthe contempt Edwyn feels for his own father. Jaime also demands that Lord \nWal\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KING ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>A former king mentioned in the text,
