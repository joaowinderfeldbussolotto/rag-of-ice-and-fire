When Stannis wants to send word that he will pardon any\nironman\n or \nnorthman\n who swears fealty, \nMelisandre\n tells him that her flames revealed that new kings will pick up\nwhere the old ones died. The \nSeven Kingdoms\n must be shown a sign, but Stannis has heard enough talk of stone\ndragons, knowing of all the follies the \nTargaryens\n caused by trying to return the \ndragons\n to life.\nDavos Seaworth\n persuades the king by asking Melisandre why she needs \nEdric Storm\n's life to raise the stone dragon.\nHe also inquires how her leeches were responsible for two kings' deaths, when one was killed by Walder Frey and\nthe other, \nBalon Greyjoy\n, fell from a bridge. He also points out that only two of the three false kings are dead so far.\nThe Red Woman has answers, but Stannis sends her away. Still not completely satisfied that he should spare Edric's\nlife, the king sends Davos away as well.\nThe Onion Knight seeks out Maester \nPylos\n, who has been teaching him how to read. Davos begins to slowly read a\nletter that arrived some time before from the \nWall\n. The missive speaks of Lord \nJeor Mormont\n's \ndefeat at the Fist\n,\nand Maester \nAemon\n's fear that the \nwildlings\n may conquer the Wall.

The castles along the Wall were designed defenseless, as the \nNight's Watch\n was not meant to be able to\nrepel a force from the South. Castle Black was meant specifically to be protected from \nwildlings\n by the \nWall\n itself.\nWhen \nStyr\n, the \nMagnar\n of the \nThenns\n, and his men attack, many of the defenders die, while Jon and \nSatin\n fire\narrows from one of the roofs. At one point, Jon has \nYgritte\n in his sights but he cannot loose an arrow at her.\nFinally Donal Noye fires the powder kegs he had placed along the lower staircase of the Wall. The Magnar and the\nrest of his men perish as the staircase and a section of ice from the Wall crushes them. Amidst the destruction, Jon\nfinds Ygritte, shot through the chest with a crossbow by someone else, and the woman he loved dies in his arms.\nNavigation:\nJon VI\n↑\nDavos V\n ←\nJon VII\n→ \nBran IV\n↓\nJon VIII\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 56: Bran IV\nPlace(s): \nthe \nNightfort\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran III\n↑\nJon VII\n ←\nBran IV\n→ \nDaenerys V\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nBran I\nSynopsis\nReaching the \nNightfort\n, \nBran\n recalls all the horror tales he’s heard about this castle, such as the stories of the \nRat\nCook\n, \nMad Axe\n, and the \nNight's King\n. Before it was abandoned by the \nWatch\n some two hundred years before, the\nNightfort had once been the greatest castle along the Wall. However, \nMeera\n and \nJojen Reed\n are unafraid of the\nancient castle. They sleep that night in the kitchens, near a seemingly bottomless well. Deep in the night, Bran is\nwoken by footsteps coming from the well. He awakens Meera, and then takes control of \nHodor\n’s body as he does\nwhen he enters \nSummer\n.\nBut it is only \nSam\n and \nGilly\n who emerge from the well, carrying Gilly’s infant son. Gilly asks them if they are the\nones \nColdhands\n was sent to find, but Bran has no idea what she is speaking of. Meera asks them how they got past\nthe Wall\n, and Sam reveals that Coldhands had led them to the \nBlack Gate\n, which only a brother of the Night’s\nWatch can open. Sam describes Coldhands as dressed all in black like a sworn brother, but his skin and the cold\nfrom his body reminded Sam of a \nwight\n. But Coldhands could speak, his eyes did not burn blue, and he and his\nravens had saved them from the wights. When the Reeds inquire why Coldhands wasn’t with them, Sam tells them\nthat the Wall was more than just ice and stone, there were ancient spells woven into it, and the Wall would not let\nColdhands pass. Jojen tells Sam that Bran is the one Coldhands seeks. Tarly realizes who Bran is, but promises not\nto tell anyone of Bran’s whereabouts on his honor and his friendship with \nJon\n.\nJoj\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0f1c7b17b70ed09fe84ee95364afa9575ed4ce7b122283338e897f5588e45b97_v2"}
