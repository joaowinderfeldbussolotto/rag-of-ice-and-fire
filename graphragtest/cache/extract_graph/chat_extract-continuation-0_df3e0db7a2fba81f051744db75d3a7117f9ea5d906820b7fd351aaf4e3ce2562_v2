Roose says that Theon has been seen where\nall the murders have occurred. Theon is freed from the suspicions due to his weakened physical and psychological\nstate, as remarked by Lady Dustin and Roger Ryswell. It is now however undeniable that someone has been\ncommitting murders, possibly at Stannis' behest. The resulting suspicion flames the tensions between the Freys and\nthe Northmen, who are reminded of their role at the \nRed Wedding\n and the fact they are surrounded by northern\nHouses who all lost people at the Red Wedding and have more than good reason to despise and do harm to the\nFreys.\nSuddenly a war horn and drum is sounded, and the men inside the walls begin to believe that Stannis has arrived.\nTheon goes to pray in the \ngodswood\n, seeing hints of \nBran\n's very face in the \nweirwood\n, hearing it whisper his name.\n\nHolly\n, \nRowan\n and a third washerwoman appear, claiming to have come for him. Theon believes that they are behind\nthe murders and want to kill him now, but they deny his suspicions and insist that there will be no more hurt for him\nbut instead a nice, quick death - but first he must see Abel.\nNavigation:\nThe Turncloak\n↑\nThe Blind Girl\n ←\nA Ghost in Winterfell\n→ \nTyrion X\n↓\nTheon I\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 47: Tyrion X\nPlace(s): \nYunkish\n camp near \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion IX\n↑\nA Ghost in Winterfell\n ←\nTyrion X\n→ \nJaime I\n↓\nTyrion XI\nSynopsis\nAll remaining crewmen and passengers of the \nSelaesori Qhoran\n are sold into slavery in a \nYunkish\n camp near\nMeereen\n. \nTyrion\n and \nPenny\n are sold together to \nYezzan zo Qaggaz\n, an immensely fat Yunkish (though a \nWesterosi\nsellsword tries hard to buy them-Tyrion suspects this is because the sellsword knows him and wants to claim\nCersei's\n bounty on his head) and put under the charge of his retainer called \nNurse\n.\nTyrion sees \nJorah Mormont\n brought on the auction block behind them. The knight tried to fight off the slavers and\nwas beaten almost to the point of death, his face is so swollen as to be almost unrecognizable. Tyrion convinces\nNurse that Mormont is an essential part of their show and needs to be bought too. Jorah fought bravely, killing three\nof the slavers, before being captured and beaten so severely. The fight went out of him once he heard that \nDaenerys\nhad wed \nHizdahr zo Loraq\n.\nOnce purchased, they are brought to Yezzan's pavilion, where they meet some of his other \"treasures\" and his most\nprized possession \nSweets\n, a hermaphrodite. They are also fitted with slave collars, which Tyrion does not mind as he\nobserves that collars can be removed. There they find out that the sellsword who also tried to buy them was \nBrown\nBen Plumm\n of the \nSecond Sons\n. In the evening, Tyrion and Penny are summoned to perform a joust for the guests of\nYezzan, including the Yunkish supreme commander \nYurkhaz zo Yunzak\n. The joust is well received, following\nwhich they are to pour wine and water for the guests. One of the men heard Tyrion's boast of his skill at \ncyvasse\n.\nTyrion plays against him and wins, angering the man. He also plays Ben Plumm as his master bets on him; he wins\nfour of five matches, and earns much gold for his master.\nAs a reward for their great jousting performance, Yezzan announces they are to repeat it in the \nGreat Pit of Daznak\nin front of tens of thousands of people.\nNavigation:\nTyrion IX\n↑\nA Ghost in Winterfell\n ←\nTyrion X\n→ \nJaime I\n↓\nTyrion XI\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 48: Jaime I\nPlace(s): \nRaventree Hall\n - \nPennytree\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime VII\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nTyrion X\n ←\nJaime I\n→ \nJon X\nJaime lifts the siege at \nRaventree Hall\n.

The siege here is much smaller than the one at\nRiverrun\n as the intentions are not to storm the castle but rather to starve them out. The siege has been going on for\nsix months and there is not much hope of rescue for \nTytos Blackwood\n as it is only a matter of time.\nJaime meets first with Lord Jonos who is in an intimate position with \nHildy\n. After she leaves, Jaime inquires as to\nwhat Jonos seeks from the situation. Jonos insists on acquiring a quarter of the \nHouse Blackwood\n lands, saying that\nthey were stolen from them long ago, and that \nTywin Lannister\n promised them to Jonos if he subdued
