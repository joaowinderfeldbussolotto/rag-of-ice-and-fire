After the \nTrident\n, Aerys sent \nhis\nwife\n and Prince \nViserys\n to \nDragonstone\n, but kept \nElia\n and her children in the \nRed Keep\n because he thought that\nPrince \nLewyn Martell\n had betrayed Rhaegar during the battle, and thus needed Elia and the children as hostages to\nensure \nDorne\n's loyalty. With the wildfire in place, Aerys told Rossart, \"The traitors want my city, but I’ll give them\nnaught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat.\" Aerys may have thought that the great\nfire would kill everyone, but transform him into a dragon, much as \nAerion Brightflame\n had thought. When the\nLannisters\n appeared before King's Landing \nVarys\n advised to keep the gates closed. But on the advice of \nPycelle\n,\nAerys let in the Lannisters, who proceeded to \nsack King's Landing\n.\nJaime felt he had to act after the Mad King commanded him to bring him his father’s head. He killed Rossart, then\nreturned to the Throne room and killed King Aerys. Days later he hunted down and killed the remaining two of\nAerys’ pyromancers, Garigus and Belis, so that their secret would die with them. When Brienne asks why no one\nelse knows this tale, Jaime tells her that the \nKingsguard\n are sworn to protect the king’s secrets, and that \nEddard\nwould never have believed his tale. Jaime then nearly passes out from the heat, and Brienne calls out for \nQyburn\n.\nThey are brought before Roose Bolton, who tells them he chose to wed \nWalda Frey\n because Lord \nWalder Frey\noffered him his bride’s weight in silver. When Brienne inquires after \nArya\n, Bolton mysteriously states that she was\nlost for a time, but she has been found and is to be returned safely to the north. Bolton tells them he awarded\nHarrenhal to \nVargo Hoat\n because the goat was a stranger to the \nSeven Kingdoms\n and did not know ‘the prize was\npoisoned’. He means the curse of Lord Tywin, for Hoat was not aware of what Tywin does to traitors such as the\nTarbecks\n and the \nReynes\n. Bolton explains that he has a small problem, because the goat wishes to return Jaime to\nRickard Karstark\n to claim the Lord’s reward of \nhis daughter\n’s hand in marriage. Vargo had Jaime’s hand chopped\noff to send as a grisly token to Lord Tywin, feeling he would be well safe in \nKarhold\n. What he doesn’t know is that\nRobb\n has beheaded Lord Karstark, and the goat is now doomed. But since Vargo is in Bolton’s employ, Tywin\nmight feel that Bolton was responsible for the maiming as well. Jaime agrees to carry word to his father absolving\nBolton of all blame. But as for Brienne, Bolton tells her, \"It would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo\nof both his prizes.\"\nNavigation:\n\nJaime IV\n↑\nDavos IV\n ←\nJaime V\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\nJaime VI\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 38: Tyrion V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion IV\n↑\nJaime V\n ←\nTyrion V\n→ \nArya VII\n↓\nTyrion VI\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n has been sent to greet the three hundred \nDornishmen\n with a small retinue. However, he is shocked when he\nfinds that the Dornishmen are being led by Prince \nOberyn Martell\n and not his brother, Prince \nDoran\n. The Red Viper\nof Dorne has an infamous reputation for using poisoned weapons in battle. The man fought in the \nFree Cities\n and\neven formed his own \nsellsword\n company, he studied at the \nCitadel\n for a time, and most importantly, he crippled\nWillas Tyrell\n in a tourney. Though this was years ago, it has never been forgotten by the \nTyrells\n, who will not be\nhappy that this man is attending the marriage of one of them.\nThe Red Viper tells Tyrion the story of how he and \nElia\n traveled to \nCasterly Rock\n when Tyrion was an infant. It was\njust after the death of \nJoanna Lannister\n. \nTywin Lannister\n was in mourning and ignored the Martells. Oberyn and Elia\nwere disappointed to find out that Tyrion was only a dwarf, after the stories they had heard about him being Tywin’s\nmonster son. The Red Viper then gets down to the point, asking Tyrion, \"when will justice be served?\" He warns\nTyrion that he does not mean to stop after killing \nGregor Clegane\n: \"Before he dies, the Enormity that Rides will tell\nme whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that.\" But Tyrion has a more subtle warning: The\nLannisters\n have tens of thousands of Tyrell men present as allies.
