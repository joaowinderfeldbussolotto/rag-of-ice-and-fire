When \nSansa\n claims\nshe does not remember, Queen \nCersei\n demands the death of a \ndirewolf\n. With \nNymeria\n gone, \nLady\n is sentenced to\ndeath instead.\nSynopsis\nAfter four days of searching, \nVayon Poole\n comes to \nNed\n with news that \nArya\n has been found unharmed. Ned is\nrelieved that it was \nJory Cassel\n who found her rather than Queen \nCersei\n’s men. Unfortunately, the \nLannister\n guards\nat the gate informed the queen, who had Arya brought directly before King \nRobert\n.\nNed rushes to the audience chamber of nearby \nCastle Darry\n, which has been hosting the king’s party during the\nsearch. He is dismayed to find the chamber full of people, preventing a private and amicable solution. Ned also\nnotes that very few in the crowd are likely to be sympathetic to the Starks; most are either Lannister men or loyal to\nthe local lord \nRaymun Darry\n, a prominent \nTargaryen\n loyalist who lost family and fortune at the \nTrident\n. However,\nNed is relieved that neither \nJaime Lannister\n nor \nSandor Clegane\n are present.\nArya apologizes to Ned profusely as she cries. Ned turns angrily to the king, demanding to know why Arya was not\nbrought to him first. Queen Cersei bristles at his tone but Robert apologizes, explaining that he only wanted to finish\nthe business quickly. Cersei then accuses Arya and \nMycah\n of ambushing Joffrey with clubs while setting \nNymeria\n to\ntear off his arm. When Joffrey affirms this, Arya calls him a liar. After the king has listened to Arya’s side of the\nstory, Lord \nRenly\n begins snickering and asks Joffrey how a skinny nine-year-old girl managed to disarm him with a\nbroom handle. When Joffrey recounts a very different story, King Robert is exasperated.\nNed reminds the king that \nSansa\n was also present and has Sansa brought in to testify. However, Sansa—torn\nbetween her family and her love for Joffrey—claims she doesn’t remember. This infuriates Arya, who lunges at\nSansa. Cersei uses this as an example of how wild Arya is, and insists she wants Arya punished. King Robert, even\nmore exasperated, orders Ned to discipline Arya while he will discipline Joffrey. Unsatisfied, Cersei demands that\nNymeria be killed and offers 100 gold dragons for her pelt. However, since Nymeria has disappeared, Cersei\ndemands the skin of the other direwolf. When Ned protests, Robert only responds that a direwolf is not a pet and that\nthe girl would be happier with a dog.\nSansa finally realizes that they are talking about \nher\n \ndirewolf\n and goes crying to Ned. In a final attempt to save the\ndirewolf, Ned insists that the king execute the wolf himself but Robert only walks away. Ned refuses to let \nIlyn\nPayne\n do the task. When Cersei voices suspicion about Ned’s intentions, Ned replies that the direwolf is from \nthe\nNorth\n and deserves better than a butcher.\nWith Sansa’s cries in his ears, Ned goes to Lady. As he sits beside the wolf waiting for his \nsword\n, Ned considers the\nnames his children chose for their wolves and finds that Sansa chose a good name for her well-behaved wolf. After\nthe deed is done, Ned commands four guardsmen to return Lady’s body to \nWinterfell\n for burial, insisting that Cersei\nwill never have her skin.\nAs he is returning, Sandor Clegane and his riders come back from the hunt. Clegane states that while they didn’t\n\nfind Arya they did find her pet and drops a corpse at Ned’s feet. As he bends to uncover the corpse, Ned wonders\nhow he will tell Arya. However, rather than Nymeria, the body turns out to be Arya’s friend Mycah, cut down from\nhorseback. When Ned states that Clegane ran the boy down, the burned man responds, “He ran. But not very fast.”\nNavigation:\nEddard II\n↑\nSansa I\n ←\nEddard III\n→ \nBran III\n↓\nEddard IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 17: Bran III\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran II\n↑\nEddard III\n ←\nBran III\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nBran IV\nWhile in his coma, \nBran\n dreams of falling and of a crow teaching him to fly.
