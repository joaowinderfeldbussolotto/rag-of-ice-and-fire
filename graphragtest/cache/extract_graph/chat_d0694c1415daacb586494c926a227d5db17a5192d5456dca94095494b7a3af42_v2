The end of the \nwar\n is within reach and \nLord Tywin\nintends to be generous to \nStark\n allies, but Joffrey wants all traitors executed and accuses his grandfather of\ncowardice during \nRobert's Rebellion\n. Tywin orders Joffrey to be escorted to his bedchamber, and Cersei leaves after\nan unsuccessful attempt to defend him. On the Dornish issue, Tywin reveals that he will not sacrifice \nGregor\nClegane\n to the \nMartells\n. Tyrion is shocked, and Tywin explains his rationale at the time of the \nSack of King’s\nLanding\n and the murder of \nElia Martell\n and her children. He also reveals that \nArya Stark\n is still alive.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n and \nSansa\n spend a joyless meal together, with both not talking much. Sansa takes a joke Tyrion makes about\nthe quality of the food as him criticizing her, but he assures her that it's not her fault and that he has more serious\nmatters to worry about. Besides \nJoffrey\n, \nCersei\n and \nhis father\n, what bothers him most are the 300 Dornishmen\nvisiting for the King's wedding. He has settled them in a cornerfort of the \nRed Keep\n, as far away from the \nTyrells\n as\npossible, yet there has already been a brawl between Tyrell and \nGargalen\n soldiers at \nFlea Bottom\n, leaving one dead,\nand a confrontation in the yard where \nOlenna Redwyne\n called \nEllaria Sand\n \"the serpent's whore\", while \nOberyn\nMartell\n keeps asking for justice concerning the death of his sister \nElia\n and her children every time he sees Tyrion.\nHowever, Tyrion sees no point in bothering his already troubled young wife with any of this. After the meal, Sansa\nasks for leave for her nightly visit to the \ngodswood\n. Although Tyrion finds Sansa's piety excessive, he allows it,\neven offering to accompany her some time. She immediately objects to this, telling him he would be bored, as\npraying to the \nold gods\n is mainly done in silence and without adornments. She knows him better than he imagined,\nhe thinks. He is tempted to ask what she prays for, but is afraid of what the answer would be.\nHe gets back to his tedious tasks as \nMaster of Coin\n, trying to make sense of some of the complicated numbers in the\nledgers \nPetyr Baelish\n left him. He considers some of Littlefinger's investments highly suspicious. Tyrion now regrets\nthat he consented so easily to the execution of the \nAntler Men\n, as he has since learned that some of them owed the\nCrown large sums and suspects that having \nBronn\n try locating their heirs will be a futile effort. Ser \nBoros Blount\narrives, delivering a summons from Lord Tywin. Tyrion is glad to leave the books. Outside, rain is in the air, making\nTyrion concerned Sansa will get soaked at the godswood.\nWhen he arrives at the \nHand’s solar\n, he finds King Joffrey, Queen Regent Cersei, Ser \nKevan\n and Grand Maester\nPycelle\n there as well, besides his father. Joffrey is obviously elated, Cersei smiles smugly, yet Lord Tywin is his\nusual grim self and Tyrion wonders whether his father can smile at all. Tyrion asks what has happened and is shown\na roll of parchment. The message reads: \"\nRoslin\n caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for\nher wedding.\" Checking the seal, Tyrion realizes that the message comes from \nThe Twins\n. He asks whether Lord\nWalder Frey\n thinks he is being poetic. He realizes that \"trout\" refers to \nEdmure Tully\n, but before he can speculate on\nthe meaning of the \"pair of wolf pelts\", Joffrey announces that the message implies that \nRobb Stark\n is dead.\nTyrion's thoughts immediately drift to his wife, probably praying this very moment to her \nfather's\n gods, for her\nbrother's victory and her \nmother's\n safety. It seems that neither the Old nor the \nNew Gods\n are listening to prayer,\nTyrion thinks, wondering whether this should give him some comfort. He makes a glib comment about the kings\nfalling like leaves this autumn and their little war winning itself, prompting a poisonly sweet reply by Cersei that it's\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d0694c1415daacb586494c926a227d5db17a5192d5456dca94095494b7a3af42_v2"}
