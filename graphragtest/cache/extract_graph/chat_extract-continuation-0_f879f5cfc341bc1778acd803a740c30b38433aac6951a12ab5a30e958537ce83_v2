When\nJaime comes to him, the king pushes him away hard, causing Jaime to fall. The king boasts that he can still knock\nJaime in the dirt and that with his war hammer nobody can stand before him. Jaime replies stiffly, “As you say, your\ngrace.”\nJoffrey then tells Sansa it grows late and asks if she needs an escort back. With Septa Mordane asleep at the table,\nJoffrey calls to the Hound to take his betrothed back to her quarters, and deserts Sansa. The Hound asks Sansa if she\nexpected Joffrey to escort her back himself and scoffs at the idea. Sansa’s dreamy night has suddenly vanished. She\ndoes not like the idea of the Hound taking her back to the apartments, but cannot wake Septa Mordane.\nAs the Hound escorts her back, Sansa cannot stand the sight of his burned face, despite insisting to herself that a true\nlady would not notice. She compliments the Hound’s riding in the joust, giving him the knightly title “Ser.” He\nresponds angrily that he is no knight and that he spits on the vows knights take. He tells her that his brother is a\nknight, and asks if he fulfills her naïve expectations. Sansa, lost for words, can only reply that no one could\nwithstand Ser Gregor. The Hound merely laughs that Sansa’s septa has taught her well: she is just a pretty little bird\nreciting the words they taught her. When Sansa tells the Hound that he is frightening her, the scarred man only\ncontinues his story, insisting that during the tourney his brother noticed Ser Hugh’s improperly fastened gorget and\npurposely let his lance ride up to kill Ser Hugh.\nThe Hound then forces Sansa to look at his burned face. When she starts to cry, the Hound tells her how his brother\nGregor burned his face when he was six for stealing a toy knight. The toy had been nothing to Gregor, who was\nalready a six-foot-tall squire. He had lifted Sandor bodily up and pressed his face into a brazier. Four years later they\nhad anointed Gregor with the seven oils, and after his said his vows he was called \nSer\n Gregor.\nSansa now feels sad for the Hound, and is no longer afraid of him. The silence goes on for a long while, and finally\nshe touches the Hound and assures him that his brother is no true knight. They travel the rest of the way in silence.\nWhen he has finally delivered her to the corridor outside her bedchamber, Sansa thanks him. The Hound’s only\nreply is a warning; keep the story about his face a secret or he will kill her.\nNavigation:\nSansa I\n↑\nCatelyn V\n ←\nSansa II\n→ \nEddard VII\n↓\nSansa III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 30: Eddard VII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard VI\n↑\nSansa II\n ←\nEddard VII\n→ \nTyrion IV\n↓\nEddard VIII\nAfter viewing the body of Ser \nHugh\n, \nNed\n and Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n struggle to convince King \nRobert\n not to compete\nin the melee. \nThe Hound\n wins the \ntourney\n when he saves the life of the \nKnight of Flowers\n.

Barristan Selmy explains that he stood\nvigil for the fallen knight himself, as the boy had no one else except a mother far away in the \nVale of Arryn\n. Ser\nHugh had been Lord \nJon Arryn\n’s squire for four years and had been knighted by King \nRobert Baratheon\n after Jon\nArryn’s death. Ned wonders if the boy was killed on purpose by a \nLannister\n bannerman to prevent Ned from\ninterviewing him.\nSer Hugh’s armor is new, forged especially for the tourney, and worth good money. Ser Barristan does not know if\nSer Hugh had even finished paying the smith. Ned replies that the boy paid dearly, and orders the silent sisters to\nhave the armor sent to the boy’s mother. Ser Barristan continues to walk with Ned and informs him that King \nRobert\nintends to fight in the melee. Ned already knows. When Ser Barristan suggests that drunken words are often\nforgotten in the morning, Ned insists that Robert will remember.\nAs they approach the king’s pavilion, they hear Robert raging at his squires, \nTyrek\n and \nLancel\n. When they enter the\ntent, Robert complains that his squires cannot even put a man’s armor on him properly, but Ned tells him the boys\nare not at fault—Robert is too fat for his armor. Robert tells Ned in mock anger that he should not call his king fat,\nand then sends the two squires off to get a breastplate stretcher from Ser \nAron Santagar\n. After the squires run out,\nRobert and Ser Barristan laugh and even Ned smiles at the thought of the boys asking for the non-existent device.\nNed asks if the two squires are from \nHouse Lannister\n.
