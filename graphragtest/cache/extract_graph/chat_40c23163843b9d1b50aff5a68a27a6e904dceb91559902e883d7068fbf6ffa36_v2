When Catelyn demands to know why she\nwas not notified, Edmure explains that with the \nSeven Kingdoms\n so volatile their father forbid it; if word had gotten\nout that he was ailing, the Lannisters might have attacked. Catelyn immediately blames herself, remembering it was\nshe who sparked the war by \narresting\n \nTyrion Lannister\n.\nThe solar is also triangular with a balcony to the east from which the walls, battlements, and river fork can be seen.\nLord Hoster’s bed has been moved onto the balcony so he can sit in the sun and watch the rivers. He is shrunken,\nlooking much older and frailer than Catelyn remembers. Lord Hoster calls her “Little Cat” and tells how he wanted\nto be awake when she arrived; he was afraid he would not wake again. He speaks weakly and is wracked by spasms\nof pain. He defends his decision to keep news of his illness a secret, but admits that he was afraid he would die\nbefore seeing her again, especially once the siege began. She tells him that Robb is here, they have \nJaime Lannister\nin irons, and Riverrun is free again. This leads Lord Hoster to tell her of the joy he had as he watched the \nbattle\n from\nthe battlements.\nHer father asks if it was Robb who won the battle and Catelyn tells him that it was. Then she mentions that Ser\nBrynden was also an important figure. Lord Hoster seems surprised by the mention of the Blackfish and asks if \nLysa\nhas come down from the \nVale\n as well. Catelyn cannot lie and explains that Lysa is frightened and believes she and\nher son are only safe in the \nEyrie\n. Hoster is very disappointed that he will not see her.\nLord Hoster agrees to see Robb, who he remembers has his Tully eyes. When Catelyn presses on to ask if he will\n\nsee his brother, her father asks if Ser Brynden has married anyone yet. Catelyn is saddened that her father cannot\nallow the old feud to rest. She tells him that his brother has not wed, nor will he ever. Lord Hoster launches into a\nweak rant, criticizing Brynden’s choice to defy him and never marry, saying that \nBethany Redwyne\n is still waiting\nfor Brynden. Catelyn has to remind her father that Bethany Redwyne has long ago married Lord \nMathis Rowan\n and\nhas three children. Her father states there were also offers from others, including Lord \nJonos Bracken\n’s daughter or\nany of three by \nWalder Frey\n. Catelyn tells how she would not have made it to Riverrun without Brynden, and her\nfather agrees that he was always a warrior. Lord Hoster agrees to see his brother later but he is too tired to fight now.\nHoster is asleep before Catelyn leaves the solar.\nBrynden is talking with the Riverrun guards when Catelyn returns, but he anxiously asks about his brother, and\nCatelyn confirms that he is dying. When Brynden asks if Hoster will see him, Catelyn conveys that he will but he is\ntoo tired to fight. Ser Brynden only laughs that his brother will be chiding him about the Redwyne girl as they light\nhis funeral pyre. Catelyn smiles and asks where she can find Robb.\nIn the halls Catelyn finds Theon regaling the garrison an account of the battle and of how \nGrey Wind\n tore off a\nman’s arm and drove the Lannister horses mad. When asked, Theon tells her that he believes Robb went to the\ngodswood\n. She realizes that this is just what Eddard would do after a battle.\nCatelyn finds Robb praying with those of his lords bannermen who hold to the \nold gods\n, including the Greatjon,\nRickard Karstark, \nMaege Mormont\n, \nGalbart Glover\n, and Lord Tytos Blackwood (one of a very few followers of the\nold gods south of \nthe Neck\n). She feels she should not disturb their prayers. As she walks through the godswood,\nmemories of her childhood beset Catelyn. Here her father taught her to ride, there Edmure fell and broke his arm,\nand under that bower she and Lysa played at kissing with \nPetyr Baelish\n and he tried to tongue them with mint from\nthe godswood on his breath. As Robb rises from his prayers, Catelyn wonders if Robb--who has ridden into battle\nand killed men with a sword--has ever been kissed in the godswood.\nWhen he sees her, Robb declares that they must call a council. Catelyn tries to get him to see his very sick\ngrandfather, but Robb insists that first they must meet to discuss the news that \nRenly Baratheon\n has proclaimed\nhimself king. Catelyn says she had expected it to be Lord \nStannis\n and Galbart Glover says they all did.\nThe meeting is held in the great hall at four long tables. Lord Hoster is too weak to attend, but the attendance\nincludes Edmure and the Blackfish with the Tully bannermen arrayed around them: Lord \nJonos Bracken\n, Lord \nTytos\nBlackwood\n, Lord \nJason Mallister\n,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_40c23163843b9d1b50aff5a68a27a6e904dceb91559902e883d7068fbf6ffa36_v2"}
