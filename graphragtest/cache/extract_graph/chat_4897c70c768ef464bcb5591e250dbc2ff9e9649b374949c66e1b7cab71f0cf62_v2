Nine months after the deaths of her brother and father, Daenerys's mother died giving birth to her\n(something for which Viserys has never forgiven her), during a summer storm which destroyed most of the\nTargaryen\n fleet which had been Dragonstone's last defense. When the garrison of Dragonstone was wiling to give\nViserys and Daenerys over to \nStannis Baratheon\n, who was \non his way to take Dragonstone\n, Ser \nWillem Darry\n and\nfour loyal men secretly took them to \nBraavos\n. There they lived in a big \nhouse with a red door\n. However, Ser Willem\ndied, leaving them without a guardian, and the servants stole what money was left. When Viserys and Daenerys\nwere put out of the house not long afte, they began to travel from city to city, never staying anywhere long, as\nViserys feared the Usurper's assassins. Daenerys recalls how rich merchants, archons and magisters became less and\nless willing to host the Targaryens as the years went by, and how Viserys had been forced to sell their mother's\ncrown. However, despite the lack of support, Viserys has become obsessed with recovering the Iron Throne.\nDaenerys knows that he is being called \"the Beggar King\" behind his back, and wonders if people have given her a\nnickname too.\nIllyrio's servants come to bathe Daenerys and prepare her for the feast given at the manse of Khal \nDrogo\n, where she\nis to meet and impress the Khal, so he will ask for her hand in \nmarriage\n. The servants tell her how lucky she is to\nmarry a man so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. Once she is properly dressed, her brother returns with\nMagister Illyrio and commands her to stand up and turn around. Illyrio showers Daenerys with compliments while\nViserys complains she is too skinny and too young. Illyrio reassures him that she is old enough for the \nkhal\n and\ncomments on her silver-gold hair and purple eyes, the hallmarks of old \nValyrian\n nobility. When Viserys states that\nbarbarians are said to have queer tastes such as boys and sheep, Illyrio warns him not to say these things to Khal\n\nDrogo, creating a flare of anger in Viserys’ eyes.\nThe three of them journey in Illyrio's litter to Khal Drogo's manse in the pitch dark. Viserys states that ten thousand\nDothraki “screamers” will be enough to overthrow \nthe usurper\n when combined with those in \nWesteros\n that are\nawaiting his return. He speculates on those who would join their cause: \nHouse Tyrell\n, \nHouse Redwyne\n, \nHouse\nDarry\n, \nHouse Greyjoy\n, and the \nDornishmen\n. Illyrio assures Viserys that the people in the \nSeven Kingdoms\n secretly\nawait his return, though Daenerys doubts him.\nIllyrio says that Drogo’s mansion was a gift from the magisters of \nPentos\n, to help win Drogo's friendship. They\narrive at the mansion and are announced as King Viserys III and Princess Daenerys. Illyrio points out several\nprominent guests, including Ser \nJorah Mormont\n, who had fled the Seven Kingdoms under sentence of death several\nyears before, and has since spent much time among the Dothraki. Illyrio then points out Khal Drogo himself, who is\nas graceful as a panther, and younger than Daenerys had expected. Viserys notes his long braid, which means he has\nnever been defeated in combat. Daenerys only notes his cold, hard face and is afraid of him. She asks to go home,\nprovoking a rant from Viserys about how their \nhome\n has been taken away from them. Daenerys only meant their\nrooms in Illyrio’s estate, but none of the places they have stayed in have been Viserys' home. Viserys also assures\nDaenerys that he would let Khal Drogo's whole \nkhalasar\n, including their horses, rape her if it would win him back\nthe Seven Kingdoms. He then tells her to stop crying, because Illyrio is leading Khal Drogo over to meet them.\nDaenerys stops crying, stands up straight, and smiles.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn I\n ←\nDaenerys I\n→ \nEddard 1\n↓\nDaenerys II\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 4: Eddard I\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys I\n ←\nEddard I\n→ \nJon I\n↓\nEddard II\nKing \nRobert I Baratheon\n arrives with his party at \nWinterfell\n, where he offers Lord \nEddard Stark\n the position of\nHand of the King\n and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4897c70c768ef464bcb5591e250dbc2ff9e9649b374949c66e1b7cab71f0cf62_v2"}
