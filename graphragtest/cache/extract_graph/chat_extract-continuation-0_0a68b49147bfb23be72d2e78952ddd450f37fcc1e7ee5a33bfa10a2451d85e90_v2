Lord Tarly\nhas created this rumour in the hopes of turning the smallfolk against Lord Beric. Ser Hyle knows a septon with great\nknowledge of the \nRiverlands\n, and proposes that they accompany the man to Saltpans. When Brienne says she has no\nintention of traveling with Hunt, he tells her that he is no longer in Lord Tarly's service. They soon depart for\nSaltpans, while Septon \nMeribald\n talks of the gods, his past and the great bands of wolves in the Riverlands led by a\ndemon of a she-wolf. Meribald tells them there may be broken men about on their way to \nQuiet Isle\n, and Brienne\nsurmises that the septon himself once had such an experience before he discovered his piety.\nNavigation:\nBrienne IV\n↑\nCersei V\n ←\nBrienne V\n→ \nSamwell III\n↓\nBrienne VI\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 26: Samwell III\nPlace(s): \nBraavos\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell II\n↑\nBrienne V\n ←\nSamwell III\n→ \nJaime III\n↓\nSamwell IV\nSynopsis\nStaying at an inn in \nBraavos\n, \nSam\n is nearing wits' end. \nDareon\n has abandoned them for the brothels, \nGilly\n remains\ninconsolable, and Maester \nAemon\n's health deteriorates daily. To make matters worse, Sam had spent nearly all their\ncoin on their rooms, a healer for Aemon, and passage on a boat, \nLady Ushanora\n, that they wound up unable to board\ndue to the maester's health. Feverish and dying, the maester begs Sam to return to the docks to learn more about this\nrumor of dragons that Dareon had heard at some winesink. Aemon mumbles to Sam, \"Dragons. The grief and glory\nof \nmy house\n... \nMy brothers\n dreamed of dragons too, and the dreams killed them, every one. Sam, we tremble on the\ncusp of half-remembered prophecies... I should have seen it. Fire consumes, but cold preserves. \nThe Wall\n...\"\nSam departs that night to find Dareon, but gets accosted by two bravos because he is wearing a sword.

Sam finds\nDareon at the \nHappy Port\n, but his brother from \nthe Watch\n wants nothing more to do with the black, or Gilly and\nAemon for that matter.

But his sister responds that she can't rely on \nDaven\n, and needs Jaime to defeat \nBrynden Tully\n, as well as\nfind out why \nGregor's men\n at \nHarrenhal\n have not released \nWylis Manderly\n as the crown requested. She states that\nOsmund Kettleblack\n will command the \nKingsguard\n in his absence, although Jaime dislikes the idea.\nJaime's command consists of \nKennos\n, \nDermot\n, \nStrongboar\n, \nRed Ronnet\n, as well as \nIlyn Payne\n and \nAddam\nMarbrand\n, whom Jaime demanded as concessions from his sister.\nOn the first night, they guest at Castle \nHayford\n, and Jaime considers the fate of his cousin \nTyrek\n, who would be lord\nof the castle were he not missing. He thinks it possible the boy is still alive, perhaps having been secreted off by\ncommand of \nVarys\n, who very well could have known that the riot would occur.\nStarting that night, Ser Jaime begins training every night with Ilyn Payne, in the hopes that he can become a\nproficient swordsman with his left hand. The company also visits \nSow's Horn\n and meets with Ser \nRoger Hogg\n.\nArriving at \nHarrenhal\n, Jaime has Gregor Clegane's men release all prisoners, including Wylis Manderly, and then\nleaves Ser \nBonifer Hasty\n and the \nHoly Hundred\n to hold the castle until \nPetyr Baelish\n takes up its lordship.
