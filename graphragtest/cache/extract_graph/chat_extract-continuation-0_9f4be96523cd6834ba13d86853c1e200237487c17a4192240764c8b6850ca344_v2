Jon denies this, but says that the outcome of the\nstruggle is unclear following the death of \nTywin Lannister\n. Jon shares a cup of wine with \nClydas\n, telling him that\nMaester \nAemon\n had shown him a passage in the \nJade Compendium\n describing \nLightbringer\n as both bright and\nfearfully hot. He notes that although Stannis's sword radiates light, it produces no heat.\nNavigation:\nJon II\n↑\nDavos I\n ←\nJon III\n→ \nDaenerys II\n↓\nJon IV\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 11: Daenerys II\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nJon III\n ←\nDaenerys II\n→ \nReek I\n↓\nDaenerys III\nSynopsis\nThere have been more murders by the \nHarpy's Sons\n on the streets of \nMeereen\n. This time they involved an attack on\nfully-armed \nUnsullied\n in pairs. Nine died, including one of \nMissandei\n's brothers, \nMossador\n. Once again, \nDaenerys\norders an investigation, permitting \nSkahaz mo Kandaq\n to torture a wineseller when she discovers that three\nfreedmen\n were among the slain. Furious, Dany orders the Unsullied to restrict themselves to patrolling the walls,\nand imposes a blood tax on the great families of Meereen to fund a new mixed force of freedmen and \nshavepates\n to\npatrol the city streets under the control of Skahaz. The families of \nZhak\n and \nMerreq\n are preparing to leave the city;\nthe Queen orders that their wealth must remain behind, as well as some of their children in her custody.\nThat night, Dany offers Missandei the chance to return to \nNaath\n, but the girl feels safer with her. Dreaming of\nDaario Naharis\n, Dany hopes that the sellsword will remain loyal to her. Dany goes to take a bath on her terrace,\nwhen she is surprised by the voice of \nQuaithe\n, speaking to her via some magic. \"Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The\nglass candles\n are burning. Soon comes the \npale mare\n, and after her the others. \nKraken\n and dark flame, \nlion\n and\ngriffin, the \nsun's son\n and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the \nUndying\n. Beware the \nperfumed\nseneschal\n.\" After telling her to remember who she is, Quaithe is gone. As the sun rises, Dany breaks her fast and\nprepares for court.\nAt court she gazes suspiciously at \nReznak mo Reznak\n - could he be a traitor? \nHizdahr zo Loraq\n pleads for the\nseventh time for the reopening of the fighting pits, this time cunningly presenting former fighters who themselves\nwillingly ask to be returned to combat. She promises to consider all they have said and then ends the session.\nBarristan Selmy\n relates how he escaped from \nKing's Landing\n and \nJoffrey\n's guards, and defends \nEddard Stark\n when\nDaenerys angrily denounces him as a traitor, asserting that Stark argued against having her killed in the \nsmall\ncouncil\n. Dany asks to see her dragons: \nRhaegal\n and \nViserion\n have been chained up in a pit since the killing of the\nlittle girl \nHazzea\n, but \nDrogon\n could not be taken and was last seen flying off north to the \nDothraki Sea\n.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nJon III\n ←\nDaenerys II\n→ \nReek I\n↓\nDaenerys III\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 12: Reek I\nPlace(s): \nthe \nDreadfort\n \n \nNavigation:\nTheon VI\nA Clash of Kings\n↑\nDaenerys II\n ←\nReek I\n→ \nBran II\n↓\nReek II\nSynopsis\nBig Walder\n and \nLittle Walder\n enter a cell in the dungeons of the \nDreadfort\n. Cowering before them is a weak and\nfoul-smelling man, who knows his name is \nReek\n - but that he once had another name.\nReek is so weakened and mentally ravaged that he is terrified of the two eight year old Freys. He remembers his\nattempt to escape with the bedwarmer \nKyra\n, but that had been a ruse by \nRamsay Bolton\n for his own amusement.\nKyra had suffered horribly at the hands of Ramsay's dogs, and Reek has lost several of his own fingers and toes\nthrough agonizing flayings at the hands of the \nBastard's Boys\n.\nThe Frey boys bring Reek before Ramsay, who is with \nArnolf Karstark\n and \nHother Umber\n. Ramsay taunts him in\nfront of his guests. The reader learns that Reek is \nTheon Greyjoy\n when \nArnolf Karstark\n recognizes him as \"Stark's\nward\". In his degraded state, Reek thinks of him as a merciful and kind master.
