Immediately she wonders if she can find the room with the monsters again. However, to do that she\nmust cross the open yard and the walls are crowded with more \ngold cloaks\n and soldiers than she has ever seen.\nReciting Syrio’s words to herself, she walks slowly across the yard to the empty royal sept, hiding Needle under the\ncloak she has put on; it is the scariest thing she has ever done. Taking two of the candles in the sept, she crawls out a\nback window.\nIt takes Arya more than an hour to find the room: crawling through windows, over walls, and through cellars. She\ngoes back to light her candle and returns. Now the monsters do not frighten her. Neither do the rats in the dungeons.\nThe \ncrypts of Winterfell\n were scarier, and she and her siblings were once taken there by \nRobb\n to visit their own\nwaiting tombs. Then Jon had suddenly appeared covered in flour, pretending to be a ghost, but that had not scared\nher. The memory of her safe home at Winterfell makes Arya smile as she plunges deeper into the darkness of the\ntunnel.\nNavigation:\nArya III\n↑\nEddard XIV\n ←\nArya IV\n→ \nSansa IV\n↓\nArya V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 51: Sansa IV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa IIV\n↑\nArya IV\n ←\nSansa IV\n→ \nJon VII\n↓\nSansa V\nOn the third day after sneaking out to tell Queen \nCersei\n of \nher father\n’s plans to send her away, \nSansa\n is summoned\nfrom her house arrest. She is brought before the queen and the \nsmall council\n. There she is informed that her father is\na traitor and is persuaded to write letters to her relatives explaining what has happened.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n is locked in a room with \nJeyne Poole\n, who does nothing but cry for \nher father\n. Sansa, thinking Jeyne was\nacting childish, has told her friend that she would ask \nQueen Cersei\n to let her see her father, but it does not seem to\nhave helped.\nSansa herself wept the first day. She was used to the sound of fighting in \nWinterfell\n, but knowing it was real—with\nangry shouts and the moans of dying men—was different. At first she pleaded for news and to see someone familiar,\nsuch as her father or her \ngallant prince\n, but she got no answer. Then they shoved Jeyne into the room and she\nclaimed they were killing everyone and that there were bodies on the steps. The next day the fighting was over and\nLannister\n guardsmen patrolled the walls. The servants who bring them food and clothes refused to answer any\nquestions. At sunset they heard the bells tolling from the \nGreat Sept of Baelor\n proclaiming King \nRobert\n’s death.\nSansa is afraid for her beautiful prince and her father and at night she dreams of Joffrey on the throne with her\nbeside him with everyone she knows coming before them to bend their knee.\nSer \nBoros Blount\n comes for her on the third day. Resolved to be a lady no matter what, Sansa complements the ugly\nknight. He leads her out of Maegor’s Holdfast, where she sees a body impaled on the spikes of the dry moat. Rather\nthan being taken to the queen’s apartments, Sansa is brought to the council chamber and presented to Queen Cersei\nand the \nsmall council\n, though her prince is not there as she was hoping.\nThe queen asks if she has been well taken care of and Sansa affirms that they have, though no one will tell them\nwhat happened. Sansa's use of the word \"us\" leads to confusion until Sansa explains that Jeyne is staying with her.\nCersei is surprised to discover that Jeyne has been put in with Sansa and expresses concern about what absurd tales\nJeyne might have told Sansa. Remembering her promise, Sansa asks about Vayon Poole, unable to imagine anyone\nkilling a steward who does not even carry a sword. Cersei asks what to do with Jeyne and \nLittlefinger\n states that he\nwill find a place for her. The queen then instructs that Jeyne be taken to Littlefinger’s apartments and that saying\nLittlefinger will take her to her father should calm her down. Sansa asks where Vayon is and where Jeyne is being\nsent, wondering why Littlefinger must be involved, but Cersei brushes off the question.\nCersei tells Sansa that Joffrey loves her, but that her father is a traitor. Varys and Pycelle explain that Lord Eddard,\nwho had sworn to protect King Robert’s children, was planning to turn the kingdom over to \nStannis Baratheon\n. Then\nCersei shows Sansa the letter her father wrote to Stannis, which has been taken off \nthe captain of his guard\n. Sansa\ninsists that it cannot be true because her father was the king’s friend.\nCersei informs Sansa that she cannot allow the daughter of a traitor to marry her son. Sansa is overwhelmed by the\nunfairness of taking away her beloved because of something her father did.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl who sneaks around King's Landing, hiding from guards and recalling memories of Winterfell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The ancestral home of House Stark, where Arya and her siblings grew up)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBB<|>PERSON<|>Arya's brother who took her to the crypts of Winterfell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON<|>PERSON<|>Arya's brother who once pretended to be a ghost in the crypts of Winterfell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRIO<|>PERSON<|>A mentor figure whose words Arya recites for courage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>The capital city where Arya is trying to escape and Sansa is held captive)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERSEI<|>PERSON<|>The Queen of the Seven Kingdoms who interrogates Sansa and declares her father a traitor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>A young noblewoman held under house arrest, forced to write letters under Cersei's orders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEYNE POOLE<|>PERSON<|>A friend of Sansa who is distraught and crying over her father's fate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>PERSON<|>A member of the small council who takes Jeyne Poole under his care)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ruling body of the Seven Kingdoms, which includes Cersei and Littlefinger)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR<|>GEO<|>A significant religious site in King's Landing where the bells tolled for King Robert's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>The late King of the Seven Kingdoms, whose death is announced by the bells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOROS BLOUNT<|>PERSON<|>A knight who escorts Sansa to the small council)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANNIS BARATHEON<|>PERSON<|>A claimant to the throne mentioned in Eddard Stark's letter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VARYS<|>PERSON<|>A member of the small council who explains Eddard Stark's alleged treason)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYCELLE<|>PERSON<|>A member of the small council who explains Eddard Stark's alleged treason)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>Sansa's betrothed, who is declared king after Robert's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD CLOAKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The city watch of King's Landing, guarding the walls and gates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANNISTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ruling family of the Seven Kingdoms, whose guards patrol the walls after the fighting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYPTS OF WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The burial place of House Stark, where Arya recalls a childhood memory)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Arya recalls memories of her home in Winterfell while navigating King's Landing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>ROBB<|>Robb took Arya to the crypts of Winterfell<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>JON<|>Jon pretended to be a ghost in the crypts of Winterfell to scare Arya<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>SYRIO<|>Arya recites Syrio's words for courage while escaping<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>CERSEI<|>Cersei interrogates Sansa and declares her father a traitor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JEYNE POOLE<|>Sansa and Jeyne Poole are held together in a room, and Sansa tries to comfort her<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>Littlefinger takes Jeyne Poole under his care, and Sansa questions his involvement<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SMALL COUNCIL<|>Sansa is brought before the small council, where Cersei and others accuse her father of treason<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JOFFREY<|>Sansa dreams of being queen beside Joffrey and fears for his safety<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERSEI<|>SMALL COUNCIL<|>Cersei presides over the small council and declares Eddard Stark a traitor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERSEI<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>Cersei instructs Littlefinger to take care of Jeyne Poole<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR<|>Sansa hears the bells of the Great Sept of Baelor tolling for King Robert's death<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>ROBERT<|>Sansa mourns the death of King Robert, who was her father's friend<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>BOROS BLOUNT<|>Boros Blount escorts Sansa to the small council<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERSEI<|>STANNIS BARATHEON<|>Cersei accuses Eddard Stark of planning to support Stannis Baratheon's claim to the throne<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>GOLD CLOAKS<|>Arya avoids the gold cloaks while escaping through King's Landing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>CRYPTS OF WINTERFELL<|>Arya recalls the crypts of Winterfell as she navigates dark tunnels<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
