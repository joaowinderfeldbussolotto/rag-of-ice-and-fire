Jon\nwarns her that if Mance's son is burned her own will die as well. She leaves wordlessly.\nSoon after, Sam arrives. After a brief discussion regarding what they know of \nthe Others\n and how to stop such\nmonsters, Jon breaks the news that he is sending Sam to the \nCitadel\n so he can train to become a maester and replace\nMaester \nAemon\n. Sam will travel by sea from \nEastwatch\n, along with Gilly, the baby, and Maester Aemon. Sam\nleaves him, distraught, while Jon remembers something Maester Aemon told him when he became Lord\nCommander of the Night's Watch:\nYou will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be\ndone. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.\nJon makes his inspection of Castle Black, during which he hears a report from \nDywen\n and \nKedge Whiteye\n that two\nof the \nqueen's men\n, Ser \nRichard Horpe\n and Ser \nJustin Massey\n, were seen riding off to the south.\nThe next morning, Jon wakes early to see off Sam, Gilly, and Maester Aemon, as they depart for Eastwatch. He then\nmeets with ranger \nBedwyck\n. Jon tells Bedwyck that he is putting a garrison in the abandoned way-castle \nIcemark\nand giving him command of it. Both of them assert the danger of wildlings climbing over and creating a toehold for\nthe rest, referring to \nRaymun Redbeard\n having done just that to bypass the wall. Jon says he is intending to garrison\nall of the castles on \nthe Wall\n, but for the time being, only Icemark and Greyguard. When he learns that \nJanos Slynt\n is\nto command Greyguard, Bedwyck urges Jon to choose someone more trustworthy.\nHalf the morning passes before Lord Janos reports as commanded, escorted by \nKegs\n and \nDolorous Edd\n. Jon tells\nhim that he is giving him command of \nGreyguard\n (partly in light of Slynt's years commanding the City Watch, but\nprimarily to separate Slynt from \nAlliser Thorne\n and end their scheming), but Slynt curses him and storms out. The\nnext morning, Jon finds Slynt breaking his fast in the common room and announces that he is giving Slynt one last\nchance to drop his spoon and report to the stables to depart for Greyguard. After Slynt refuses him again and mocks\nhim in front of his men and Stannis' men, Jon instructs \nIron Emmett\n and Edd to take Slynt to the Wall and hang him.\nAs Slynt is being dragged out, Jon changes his mind and orders a block brought so he can behead Slynt himself with\nLongclaw\n. With his head on the block, Slynt desperately begs Jon for mercy. Jon refuses and carries out the\nexecution. Watching from the steps of the \nKing's Tower\n, Stannis meets Jon's eyes and nods briefly in approval.\nNavigation:\nJon I\n↑\n\nThe Merchant's Man\n ←\nJon II\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nJon III\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 8: Tyrion III\nPlace(s): \nGhoyan Drohe\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n↑\nJon II\n ←\nTyrion III\n→ \nDavos I\n↓\nTyrion IV\nSynopsis\nAs dawn breaks \nTyrion\n awakes to find the litter has stopped.

Illyrio tells them the dwarf's name is Yollo,\nalthough Tyrion, misliking the name, claims it is his name in \nPentos\n and his name is Hugor Hill. The pair tease\nTyrion with tales of river \npirates\n and the \nShrouded Lord\n. Tyrion and Haldon test each others' book knowledge while\nDuck recounts the events that led to his knighting at the hands of \nGriff\n and his unusual name.

Griff is mistrustful and Tyrion is convinced he is no ordinary \nsellsword\n - he can\nread, and he is a \nknight\n, having knighted Duck himself. Tyrion promises to serve \nDaenerys Targaryen\n faithfully, but\nasks \"What if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of dragons was just some sailor's drunken fancy?\nThis wide world is full of such mad tales.
