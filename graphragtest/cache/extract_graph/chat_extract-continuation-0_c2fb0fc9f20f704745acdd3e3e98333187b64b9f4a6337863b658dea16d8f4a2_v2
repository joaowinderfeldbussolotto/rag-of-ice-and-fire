Lothar brings his father’s terms that Robb appear in person to offer apology, and\nthat Edmure marry \nRoslin Frey\n immediately. Robb dismisses Lothar and Bastard Walder, and when Edmure balks at\nnot being able to choose his wife, the Blackfish reminds him that he must make amends for his blunder with the\nBattle of the Fords\n.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n↑\nArya VI\n ←\nCatelyn IV\n→ \nDavos IV\n↓\nCatelyn V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 36: Davos IV\nPlace(s): \nDragonstone\n \n \nNavigation:\nDavos III\n↑\nCatelyn IV\n ←\nDavos IV\n→ \nJaime V\n↓\nDavos V\nSynopsis\nAxell Florent\n brings \nDavos\n before King \nStannis\n, taking the torch with him to leave his brother \nAlester\n alone in the\ndarkness. Axell tells Davos in private that he has seen Stannis’ victory in the flames, and if Davos does not help him\nbecome \nHand\n, he will see the Onion Knight killed. Stannis proclaims that Alester will die for treason, and has Axell\ntell Davos of his plan to invade \nClaw Isle\n. Davos calls the plan a folly, and Stannis dismisses the enraged Axell.\nStannis mentions that \nBarristan Selmy\n once told him that \"the rot in \nKing Aerys\n' reign began with \nVarys\n\", and that\nRobert\n should have killed the eunuch, and sent \nJaime\n to \nthe Wall\n as Lord \nEddard\n had suggested, but Robert listened\nto \nJon Arryn\n instead.\nStannis then raises Davos to Lord of the \nRainwood\n, Admiral of the \nNarrow Sea\n, and his new Hand of the King.\nWhen Stannis mentions battle, Davos mistakes him to mean the continuance of the war, but \nMelisandre\n has entered\nthe room and calls it \"the \ngreat battle\n… Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends\". Stannis has also seen a\nvision in the flames, of men in black with torches on a high hill in the forest during snow, while all around them\nshapes were moving. Melisandre proclaims that Westeros must unite under King Stannis in order to defeat the one\nwhose name must not be spoken. The King takes three leeches fat with the blood of \nEdric Storm\n and tosses them\none at a time into a brazier, naming each of the false kings: \nJoffrey\n, \nBalon Greyjoy\n, and \nRobb\n. Melisandre tells him\nthat this is not the best way, for it both will and will not work. The better way is to sacrifice Edric Storm to the\nflames, for there is power in a king's blood: Melisandre believes that his death will wake the stone dragon, as\nprophesized, and the sacrifice of one life to save thousands of others is warranted, but Stannis will not hear of it.\nNavigation:\nDavos III\n↑\nCatelyn IV\n ←\nDavos IV\n→ \nJaime V\n↓\nDavos V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 37: Jaime V\nPlace(s): \nHarrenhal\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime IV\n↑\nDavos IV\n ←\nJaime V\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\nJaime VI\nSynopsis\nJaime\n and \nBrienne\n are in the bathhouse in \nHarrenhal\n, washing themselves before meeting \nRoose Bolton\n. Jaime feels\ndizzy in the hot bath, and begins to tell Brienne his story despite his own misgivings about revealing the tale. Jaime\nsays, \"\nAerys\n would have bathed in wildfire if he’d dared. The \nTargaryens\n were all mad for fire.\" After the \nBattle of\nthe Bells\n, Aerys realized that \nRobert Baratheon\n was no mere outlaw, and that the Targaryens faced their greatest\nthreat since the \nBlackfyre Pretenders\n. He began to disperse his \nKingsguard\n to take command of the army, recalled\nRhaegar\n from the south, and sent letters to \nCasterly Rock\n. But when \nTywin Lannister\n never responded, Aerys\ncommanded his pyromancers \nRossart\n, \nGarigus\n and \nBelis\n “to place caches of \nwildfire\n throughout \nKing's Landing\n.”\nLord \nChelsted\n, the current \nHand\n, found out what was going on and tried to stop Aerys from continuing along his\nmad course, but Aerys had him killed and named the pyromancer Rossart, the man who had burned \nRickard Stark\nalive, his Hand.\nAll this time, Jaime remained in the throne room guarding the king and his secrets. After the \nTrident\n, Aerys sent \nhis\nwife\n and Prince \nViserys\n to \nDragonstone\n, but kept \nElia\n and her children in the \nRed Keep\n because he thought that\nPrince \nLewyn Martell\n had
