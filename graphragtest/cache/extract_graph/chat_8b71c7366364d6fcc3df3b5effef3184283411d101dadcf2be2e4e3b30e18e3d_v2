He was captured by Borrell's men while trying to find passage off the island to \nWhite Harbor\n. \nSalladhor\nSaan\n's fleet had been smashed by storms since heading south from the \nWall\n, until Saan, frustrated by \nStannis\nBaratheon\n's continual inability to make good on his promises, abandoned his cause, leaving his old friend Davos on\nSweetsister after Davos refused to journey south with him. Davos conceals this fact from Borrell, telling him that\nSaan has traveled south to raid the Lannisters at Stannis' command. Borell informs Davos that \nLysa Arryn\n is dead -\nand \nTywin Lannister\n, at the hand of \nhis dwarf son\n. We also learn that a shipload of \nFreys\n have reached White\nHarbor, with its Lord, \nWyman Manderly\n of White Harbor having pledged his allegiance to \nKing Tommen\n. The news\ndismays Davos, but he hides his reaction and asks Borrell to help him get to White Harbor.\nBorrell tells of his meeting with \nEddard Stark\n during \nRobert's Rebellion\n. Ned was attempting to reach \nWinterfell\n so\nhe could call his banners and join Robert's Rebellion, while avoiding \nGulltown\n, which was loyal to \nthe Mad King\n.\nStark had arrived at the \nThree Sisters\n after crossing the mountains to the Fingers, where he convinced a fisherman to\ncarry him to White Harbor. The fisherman drowned during passage, but the fisherman's daughter got Ned to The\nSisters. Lord Godric asserts that Ned left her with a bag of silver and a bastard son, whom she named \nJon Snow\n,\nafter Arryn. Borrell's father decided to let Ned go on his way instead of turning him over to the \nTargaryens\n after\ntelling Ned \"If you lose, you were never here\".\nBorrell decides to let Davos go on his way instead of turning him in, just as his father did to Ned Stark. Davos echos\nthe sentiments expressed by Ned Stark and agrees to deny his presence in Sweetsister if Stannis winds up on the\nlosing side of the conflict.\nNavigation:\nDavos VI\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nTyrion III\n ←\nDavos I\n→ \nJon III\n↓\nDavos II\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 10: Jon III\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon II\n↑\nDavos I\n ←\nJon III\n→ \nDaenerys II\n↓\nJon IV\nSynopsis\nAt \nCastle Black\n \nMelisandre\n is preparing to burn \nMance Rayder\n in a cage made out of wood from the \nhaunted forest\n,\ndespite \nJon\n's pleas to King \nStannis\n to spare him. At the sight of the cage, Mance's courage fails and he goes to his\ndeath begging for mercy, denying his kingship and his name and shrieking of witchcraft. Melisandre burns the \nHorn\nof Joramun\n as well, so that the Wall can never fall. As the cage burns Jon orders his bowmen to shoot Mance with\narrows, a fitting end for a man of the \nNight's Watch\n. Melisandre proclaims to the assembled \nwildlings\n that Stannis is\ntheir true King, \nAzor Ahai\n reborn. Stannis draws \nLightbringer\n which is blindingly bright, and promises all who\nserve him food, land and justice. The gates of the \nWall\n are opened and most of the captive wildlings enter to kneel\nbefore Stannis, feeding the fire with fragments of \nweirwood\n, pieces of the \nold gods\n to feed \nR'hllor\n's fires.\nBowen Marsh\n thinks it is wrong to let thousands of wildlings south of the Wall, and would prefer to seal the gates\nand let the wildlings defend the northern side. Many of the men of the Night's Watch are also muttering against the\nperception that Jon has taken Stannis' side in the game of thrones. Jon denies this, but says that the outcome of the\nstruggle is unclear following the death of \nTywin Lannister\n. Jon shares a cup of wine with \nClydas\n, telling him that\nMaester \nAemon\n had shown him a passage in the \nJade Compendium\n describing \nLightbringer\n as both bright and\nfearfully hot.
