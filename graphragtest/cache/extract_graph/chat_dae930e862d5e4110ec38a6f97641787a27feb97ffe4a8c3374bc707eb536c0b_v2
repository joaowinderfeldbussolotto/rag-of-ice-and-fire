Returning to his\ntent, Tyrion is greeted by a whore named \nShae\n, whom \nBronn\n has found for him. Before dawn, Tyrion is roused by\nthe call to arms. In the ensuing \nbattle on the Green Fork\n, Tyrion and his clansmen do well and the enemy is routed.\nAfterward Lord \nTywin Lannister\n learns that Robb Stark has tricked him.\nSynopsis\nA long table draped with a golden cloth has been set up on a hill overlooking the \nkingsroad\n for Lord \nTywin\nLannister\n and his chief knights and lords bannermen to take their evening meal. \nTyrion\n, arriving late, is embarrassed\nas he waddles up to the table. Lord Tywin mocks that he will charge Tyrion with burying the dead if he arrives as\nlate to battle as he does to table. Tyrion replies sourly that surely a peasant or two could be found for him to kill.\nThe news from Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n is that \nRobb Stark\n has moved south from the \nTwins\n with \nHouse Frey\n’s levies\nin tow and is now no more than a day away. Tyrion mockingly protests that he is about to eat and Tywin asks if the\nthought of coming to grips with Robb unmans him. Tyrion jests that he would prefer to come to grips with the roast\npig, which is far more tender and better smelling than Robb.\nThe army’s quartermaster, Lord \nLeo Lefford\n, who has had to supply Tyrion’s 300 \nclansmen\n, uses this opportunity to\nquip that he hopes the clansmen are braver than Tyrion or else they have wasted good steel. Tyrion assures him that\nthe arms and armor will be put to good use. Ser \nKevan\n, who Tyrion knows is giving voice to Lord Tywin’s thoughts,\ntakes the opportunity to inform Tyrion that he and his clansmen will fight in the vanguard since they seem so\nferocious. Tyrion stresses the ferocity of the clansmen by recounting their recent lethal fight over a sausage.\nLord Tywin uses this as evidence of a poor commander who cannot maintain discipline. Tyrion knows that \nhis\nbrother\n could always make men follow him eagerly, but Tyrion lacks such charisma and must use gold and his\nfamily name to get men to follow him. Tywin then tells Kevan that because the clansmen have no discipline, maybe\nthey should not be in the vanguard. When Lord Tywin suggests that he should guard the baggage instead, Tyrion\nangrily agrees to command the vanguard, only to learn that he will not command, but be under Ser \nGregor Clegane\n.\nDisgusted, Tyrion excuses himself after only eating one bite of the delicious pork.\nTyrion gets lost in the camp but finds his way by following the sounds of \nShagga\n’s laughter in the dark. \nConn\n calls\nfor him to share their meat and Tyrion agrees to join them when it is cooked, doubting that will be before the battle.\nWhen he reaches his tent, he finds Bronn sharing wine with his new servants—a groom, a body servant, a squire\nnamed \nPodrick Payne\n, and a slim young dark-haired whore named \nShae\n. Tyrion told Bronn to find him a young one\nwith a pretty face and to be sure to tell her who and what he is, so as to avoid the displeasing look of revulsion that\nsometimes greets him. He likes the girl Bronn has found.\nTyrion invites Shae into his tent. When he asks if she is a maiden, Shae tells him that finding out will cost him\ndouble and Tyrion decides they will get along fine. Tyrion explains that her duties besides sleeping with him include\nserving him and monogamy. When they have sex, Shae expresses pleasure, which pleases Tyrion, who decides he\ndoes not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_dae930e862d5e4110ec38a6f97641787a27feb97ffe4a8c3374bc707eb536c0b_v2"}
