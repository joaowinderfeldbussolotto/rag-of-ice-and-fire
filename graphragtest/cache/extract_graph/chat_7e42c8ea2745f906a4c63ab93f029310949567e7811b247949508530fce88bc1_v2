Meera is still worried, but Bran assures her that he would not have drawn her blood; he knows\nand likes her. Bran thinks about how Meera is so like his sister \nArya\n, and tells them that he wishes they were their\nwards instead of \nBig Walder\n and \nLittle Walder\n. They have stayed after all the others have gone, and have become\nhis constant companions. Bran tells Meera he has never heard of anyone fighting with a net, and asks if their master-\nat-arms taught her. She tells him her father taught her, and they have no knights or ravens at \nGreywater Watch\n; the\nisland moves so neither ravens nor enemies can find it. When Bran asks if he would be welcome at Greywater\nWatch after the hostilities end, they assure him that \ntheir lord father\n would welcome him anytime, and that leaving\nWinterfell\n sooner rather than later would be good for him.\nIt is revealed that the \nBastard of Bolton\n has forcibly taken Lady \nHornwood\n as his wife after the \nharvest feast\n, that\nLord \nManderly\n took her castle to protect it, and Ser \nRodrik\n has gone east to settle the uprising and see that justice is\ndone. Bran could ask Ser Rodrik about visiting the Reeds when he returns.\nMeera reveals that Jojen has the \ngreensight\n; he has dreams of things that have not happened but sometimes do; Jojen\ncorrects this by saying they always do. Bran asks to hear about the dreams, and is told that Jojen will, but only if\nBran tells them about his own dreams. Bran denies he has dreams, saying that Maester \nLuwin\n gives him sleeping\ndraughts, which he admits help only sometimes. Meera tells him that everyone in the Castle hears him scream when\nhe sleeps. Bran does not tell, but is interested in what dreams Jojen has had. Jojen thinks that Bran is \nthe Winged\nWolf\n bound to earth by chains. He also states that a crow is trying to peck through the chains, but his beak can only\nchip them. When asked if the crow has 3 eyes, Jojen nods.\nThe crow first came to Jojen when he almost died of greywater fever, and to Bran after he fell. It told him he had to\nfly, but when Bran woke, he was broken and couldn’t fly. After hearing this, Jojen is sure that Bran is the Winged\nWolf, and they tell Bran that the \nthree-eyed crow\n is not in Greywater Watch, but north, \nbeyond the Wall\n. When their\nfather heard Jojen’s dream, he sent them to Winterfell. When Bran asks how he will break the chains he is told to\nopen his eye, not the two that are opened, but the third one; when he opens his third eye he will be able to see south\nto the \nSummer Sea\n and north beyond the Wall.\nBran decides that he is tired of talking of crows, and wants to talk about something else, and then asks about \nlizard-\n\nlions\n. However, Jojen keeps asking Bran about his dream, whether he has dreamed he was Summer, and then reveals\nthat when he touched Summer the night of the harvest feast he felt Bran in Summer, and that he felt Bran fall. He\nthen asks if falling scares Bran; Bran thinks of \nthe golden man\n, and that he scares him. He has not been able to tell\nSer Rodrik or Maester Luwin, so cannot tell the Reeds either. Jojen continues by asking if he falls every night, and\nthere is a low rumbling growl from Summer. Meera puts herself between Summer and her brother and asks Bran to\nkeep the wolf back. Bran claims that Jojen is making Summer angry, but Meera responds that it is him that Jojen is\nmaking angry, his fear. She tells Bran that he and Summer are part of each other. \nShaggydog\n arrives. The direwolf\nlunges and Meera tells Bran to call them off, but he does not know how, and Jojen tells Bran that Summer is\nreacting to his anger. Meera tells her brother to climb the tree. Jojen responds that it is not his day to die, but\ncomplies, and Meera follows.\nBran has been unable to call off the wolves, but remembers he is not alone and calls to \nHodor\n. When Hodor appears,\nBran tells him to chase the wolves away, which he gleefully does. When Jojen returns to the ground he never takes\nhis eyes off Summer as he tells Bran that they will talk again. Bran only thinks that it was the wolves, not him, and\ntells Hodor to bring him to Maester Luwin.\nWhen he is with Maester Luwin, he tells him that Meera said her brother has the Greensight. Luwin explains that\ntheir wise men call such people greenseers. He then tells Bran that nobody truly knows what it is, but that the \nFirst\nMen\n thought the greenseers could see through the eyes of the \nweirwood\n, which is why the men cut down the trees,\nand that they have control over animals and fish. When asked, Bran tells the maester that Jojen only claims to have\ndreams that sometimes come true. The maester tells Bran that everyone has dreams that come true, like when he and\nRickon dreamed their \nfather\n was in the crypts before they knew he was dead. He then asks Bran whether he\nremembers the meaning of the metals of a maester’s\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7e42c8ea2745f906a4c63ab93f029310949567e7811b247949508530fce88bc1_v2"}
