She fears for \nher father\n, \nher brother\n,\nher husband\n, her daughters, and her sons in \nWinterfell\n. However, there is nothing she can do for any of them, so she\nmust save her strength for Robb and for that she must be as fierce and hard as the north.\nAs she watches her son’s actions, Catelyn realizes that he has learned so much from Ned, but worries about what he\nhas not learned. Ser \nBrynden\n leads a hundred outriders to scout and screen their movements. His reports state that\nLord \nWalder Frey\n has gathered 4,000 men at \nthe Twins\n and that Lord \nTywin’s\n host is days to the south. Lord Frey\nshould have gone south to join the host at \nRiverrun\n. When Catelyn rides forward, Robb is telling his companion of\nthe day that Lord Frey must be waiting to join his power to theirs. Catelyn reminds her son that if he expects nothing\nfrom Lord Frey he will never be surprised and that Lord Frey was always too friendly with the \nLannisters\n for a\nbannerman to \nHouse Tully\n.\nAfter they make camp, \nTheon Greyjoy\n brings another report from Ser Brynden. A dozen Lannister scouts have been\nkilled, and the Lannister force under Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n is retreating south, burning as they go. Theon declares\nthere is no way the Lannisters will know they have split their forces, but Catelyn cautions that Walder Frey may tell\nthem. She encourages them to place archers to kill any ravens leaving the Twins, but Theon says it has already been\ndone.\nAs she wonders what the Freys have been doing, Catelyn is told that there has been some fighting between the Freys\nand Marbrand’s men, but most of the Frey strength is at the Twins. This gives hope to Robb that Lord Frey will\nhonor his vows, but Catelyn points out that it is one thing to protect one’s land and another to engage in open battle.\nThe only way across the \nGreen Fork\n north of the \nRuby Ford\n is the bridge at the Twins, especially with the river\nrunning high and no wood for rafts. Theon suggests that they can storm the Twin if they must (they have five times\nLord Frey’s numbers), but Catelyn responds that it would not be easy. There is also no time; while they laid siege to\nthe Twins, Lord Tywin would bring up his host and attack from the rear. Catelyn can see that Robb is unsure as he\nasks her what his father would do. Catelyn insists that he would find a way across no matter what it takes.\nSer Brynden arrives with the dire news that Edmure’s host has been \ndefeated\n under the walls of Riverrun and\nscattered. Edmure himself has been wounded and captured, but some survivors have taken refuge inside Riverrun.\nOther news is that Lord Frey has withdrawn his strength inside his twin castles. Robb is frustrated, and states that he\nwill pull the walls down around Lord Frey. Catelyn rebukes him, saying he sounds like a sulky boy and that\nsometimes words are needed. She explains that the Freys have never failed to extract their toll in the 600 years that\nthey have controlled the crossing. What this toll will be, they have yet to learn but if Robb is unwilling to pay the\ntoll, the only option Catelyn can see is to retreat to \nMoat Cailin\n to meet Lord Tywin in battle. She rides away, not\nwanting to make it seem that she was usurping Robb’s authority and asks herself if her husband has taught their son\nwisdom, or how to kneel.\n\nIt is near midday when they arrive at the Twins, two ugly stout castles on either side of the Green Fork with a wide\nbridge between them. The Freys have gotten rich off the tolls from this bridge. Upon seeing the castles, the northern\nlords can see it would be very nearly impossible to take by storm. A dozen knights led by Ser \nStevron Frey\n, heir to\nLord Walder, come forward from the sally port. Ser Stevron asks who leads and Robb rides forward to be told that\nLord Walder invites him to share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain his purpose. None of Robb’s\nlords like this, fearing that Robb could easily be captured and sold to the Lannisters. Catelyn can tell that Stevron is\nnot pleased by the accusations, and attempts to save the negotiations by volunteering to go herself. There are\nobjections, but she tells them that Lord Walder is her father’s bannerman and will not harm her, hoping it is true. It\nis agreed and Stevron’s brother, Ser \nPerwyn Frey\n, remains as a hostage to her fair treatment.\nThe frail 90-year-old Lord Walder Frey meets Catelyn in the great hall with all but one (the hostage, Perwyn) of his\n21 sons, 36 grandsons, and countless other descendants. Walder is impolite and direct; even some of his sons\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0b8f28cd390ff20514480b2efe598995471cbb53321c34fadf99e5369fa52eab_v2"}
