She knows her father is still angry about it, but believes that blaming Joffrey would be like\nblaming her for something \nArya\n did. The mention of Arya leads Jeyne to speak of how she saw Arya walking on her\nhands. Both agree that they cannot understand why Arya does anything.\nNext Sansa tells Jeyne about \nYoren\n coming before the throne to ask for more men to man \nthe Wall\n. After seeing the\ndirty, smelly \nNight's Watch\n recruiter (nothing like her \nUncle Benjen\n), Sansa felt sorry for her bastard brother \nJon\nSnow\n. No one would volunteer for the Watch, so her father gave Yoren his pick of the dungeons. Jeyne soon\ninterrupts Sansa to suggest they go to the kitchen to get some lemon cakes and Sansa agrees.\nThe next morning Sansa wakes to watch Lord Beric depart with his men and thinks it is a song come to life.\nAfterward, the \nTower of the Hand\n is so empty Sansa is even happy to see Arya. Arya asks if the men have gone to\nhunt down Jaime Lannister, and Sansa explains that they have gone for Ser Gregor Clegane. Sansa then asks Septa\nMordane whether they will put the Mountain’s head on a spike over his own gate or bring it back to \nKing's Landing\n.\nThe septa is horrified that Sansa would discuss such a thing over breakfast.\nArya wonders why men were not sent after Jaime Lannister, since he killed \nJory Cassel\n and the others, or after \nthe\nHound\n for killing her friend \nMycah\n. Sansa declares that it is not the same thing because Mycah attacked Joffrey.\n\nArya erupts, shouting that Sansa is a liar. Sansa responds snobbishly that Arya can say whatever she wants but will\nstill have to bow and call her “Your Grace” after she marries Joffrey. Arya throws an orange at Sansa, staining her\nbeautiful ivory dress and driving Sansa to declare that it should have been Arya they killed, not \nLady\n. The septa\norders both of them to their rooms, where Sansa tears off her stained clothes and goes to sleep.\nSansa is dreaming of Lady when Septa Mordane wakes her and brings her to her father. Once Arya is brought, Sansa\nimmediately claims that Arya started the fight and ruined her dress. Eddard silences Sansa and Arya takes the\nopportunity to apologize and ask for Sansa’s forgiveness. Sansa is dumbfounded but eventually asks about her dress.\nArya offers to wash it, or failing that to sew her a new one.\nEddard interrupts to tell them that he did not call them in to talk about dresses but to inform them that he is sending\nthem back to \nWinterfell\n. Both sisters exclaim their unhappiness, and Eddard laughs that at last they can agree upon\nsomething. Sansa insists that she has done nothing wrong and tells her father to send Arya away since she started it.\nEddard explains that he is not sending them away as a punishment, but to keep them safe.\nSansa insists that she cannot go; she is to marry Prince \nJoffrey\n, whom she loves as much as Queen \nNaerys\n loved\nPrince \nAemon\n. She wants to be his queen and have his babies. Eddard assures Sansa that he will find her an\nappropriate match and that Joffrey is no Prince Aemon. Sansa insists that she wants Joffrey and that she will give\nhim a son with beautiful golden hair who will be the greatest king there ever was, as brave as a \nwolf\n and as proud as\na \nlion\n. Arya points out that Joffrey is not a lion, but a \nstag\n like his father, and a craven and a liar besides. Sansa cries\nout\nHe is \nnot!\n He's not the least bit like that old drunken king.\nEddard gets a strange look on his face before telling them that they will sail as soon as he can find a ship. He also\nwarns them not to tell anybody. Septa Mordane returns to urge Sansa to stop crying while Arya insists that a journey\nby ship will be an adventure and that they will get to see everybody back at Winterfell again. Sansa remains furious\nand storms off to her bedchamber and bars the door.\nNavigation:\nSansa II\n↑\nEddard XI\n ←\nSansa III\n→ \nEddard XII\n↓\nSansa IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 45: Eddard XII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard XI\n↑\nSansa III\n ←\nEddard XII\n→ \nDaenerys V\n↓\nEddard XIII\nNed\n now knows the truth \nJon Arryn\n died for.
