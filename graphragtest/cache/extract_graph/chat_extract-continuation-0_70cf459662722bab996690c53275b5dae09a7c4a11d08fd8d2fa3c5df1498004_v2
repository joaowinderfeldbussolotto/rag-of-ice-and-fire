Cersei does not appreciate the young queen's tone, and claims that it must fall to \nHighgarden\n to\nretake \"these rocks\". \nLoras Tyrell\n interjects as his sister seethes, stating that his brothers \nWillas\n and \nGarlan\n have the\nmen, but not the ships, to win back the islands. He requests that Cersei pull Lord \nRedwyne\n's fleet from their \nsiege of\nDragonstone\n, so they may return to gather troops at the \nArbor\n. The Queen Regent denies his request, implying that\nthe Redwyne fleet would not depart until \nDragonstone\n fell. Knowing that Lord Paxter intended to starve them out,\nSer Loras asks leave to lead the assault, and promises Cersei Dragonstone within a fortnight. Pleased by this\nunexpected \"gift\", Cersei grants him permission.\nReturning to her apartments, \nPycelle\n objects to her sending Loras, but Cersei is hoping the knight will die besieging\nthe walls of Dragonstone; but if not, she would still strike a blow against \nStannis\n. When she meets \nQyburn\n, he\nmentions that he has a \"champion\" to replace Loras should he fall. Cersei is not so sure of Qyburn's \"paragon\", and\ninforms him that the smiths she hired believe the weight of the armor he requested cannot be borne by a human.\nLater, in bed, Lady \nTaena\n asks her certain questions; Cersei becomes concerned the woman may report her answers\nto Margaery. But Taena assures her that all her secrets are safe. However, their chat is interrupted by a guard\npounding on her door with word that \nFalyse Stokeworth\n begged to see her. Cersei finds the woman battered, and\nlistens to the tale of \nher husband\n's death. After \nBronn\n defeated him in single combat, but before killing him, Bronn\nforced Ser Balman to confess who put him up to this. Bronn then told Falyse to leave immediately or meet the same\nfate. When Falyse told \nher mother\n's guards to arrest Bronn, they laughed and told her to listen to \"Lord Stokeworth\".\nFearful that Falyse would spread rumors of Cersei's involvement, Cersei summons Lord Qyburn so that he could\ntake another female subject to his lab in the \nblack cells\n. Back in her room, a very inebriated Cersei contemplates\nhow to deal with Bronn, and then begins to fondle Taena, \"claiming her rights as queen\" the way \nRobert\n would do to\nher when he was drunk.\nNavigation:\nCersei VI\n↑\nBrienne VI\n ←\nCersei VII\n→ \nJaime V\n↓\nCersei VIII\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 33: Jaime V\nPlace(s): \nRiverrun\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime IV\n↑\nCersei VII\n ←\nJaime V\n→ \nCat of the Canals\n↓\nJaime VI\nSynopsis\nReaching the camps besieging \nRiverrun\n, \nJaime\n meets with his cousin Ser \nDaven\n. The new Warden of the West spits\nwhen he discovers that it was \nVargo Hoat\n who had Jaime's hand amputated, informing him that he offered \nTywin\n to\nforage for Hoat, but he refused, saying that some tasks are fit for lions, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs.\nDaven reveals how much the \nFreys\n are vexing him, and even their own uncle \nEmmon Frey\n is trying his patience,\ncomplaining that he doesn't want his new seat destroyed by a siege. Worst of all is Ser \nRyman\n, who keeps tying a\nnoose around \nEdmure Tully\n's neck each morning threatening the \nBlackfish\n that he means to hang him unless\nRiverrun surrenders; however, the Blackfish has long exposed Ryman's threat to be empty.\nThey speak of \nLancel\n and his abandonment of \nDarry\n, which reminds Jaime of the looks on \nAmi\n's family's faces\nwhen Lancel made his intentions clear. He is all too aware of how Lord \nWalder\n \ndeals with\n \nthose who break Frey\nmarriage proposals\n. Daven tells the Lord Commander that their uncle \nKevan\n passed through the camps heading\nwest. He also mentions that Edmure's wife \nRoslin\n is pregnant, and oddly she is fond of the dispossessed Lord of\nRiverrun. He also tells Jaime of Lord \nGawen Westerling\n constantly hounding him to rescue his wife and children,\nwho are being held captive by Ser Brynden Tully.\nJaime is perturbed to learn how little help they are receiving from the bannermen of the Tullys who bent the knee to\nthe \nIron Throne\n after the \nRed Wedding\n. He realizes that he must secure Riverrun quickly to put down any threat of\nrebellion. Starving them out would take far too long.\nThe next morning, Jaime is considering a parley with Ser Brynden, and recalls when he was a squire of \nSumner\nCrakehall\n, sent to Riverrun with a message. Lord \nHoster\n seated Jaime next to \nLysa\n, but the young man was far more\ninterested in Lysa\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
