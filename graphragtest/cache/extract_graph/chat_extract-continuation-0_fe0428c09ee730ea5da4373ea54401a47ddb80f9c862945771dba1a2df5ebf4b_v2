A young boy tells her how two of his father's houseshold slaves had killed his father and older\nbrother, and raped and killed his mother. He request they be hanged, but Daenerys has to deny him, as she had\ndeclared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack, and will not punish slaves for rising up against\ntheir masters. The boy attempts to attack her upon hearing her decision, but fails when he trips on his own tokar.\nDaenerys forgives him and sends him away, but as he leaves she sadly thinks to herself that the Harpy has just\ngained another Son.\nThe day at court ends with petitions made by shepherds claiming that her dragons have devoured their animals;\nSome have even brought burned bones as proof. Although she is convinced that some of the claims are false,\nDaenerys orders Reznak to pay they for the animals they have lost. The petitioners are all sent away, but one man\nstays behind. As Daenerys asks him what he wants from them, he empties a sack of burnt bones on the floor. Reznak\nangrily berates him, telling him the compensations for the losses are to be collected the next morning, but Barristan\nquickly speaks up while Daenerys comes to the same realization.

In the dream Ghost is aware of the presence of the other stark direwolves \nNymeria\n, \nShaggydog\n and \nSummer\n.\nJon is awakened from the dream by \nJeor Mormont\n's raven. He resides in the old quarters of \nDonal Noye\n, since\nStannis\n occupies the King’s Tower and the Lord Commander’s Tower has burned down. He reflects that Ghost\nknows that \nGrey Wind\n is dead, but his other brothers' wolves are still alive. His wolf dreams are becoming more\nvivid and more frequent, and he wonders if part of \nBran\n and \nRickon\n survive in their wolves.\nAs \nLord Commander of the Night's Watch\n, Jon heads off to treat with King Stannis, who has requested his presence.\nAs Jon crosses the yard, he gives advice to sparring recruits and is challenged to a duel by Ser \nGodry Farring\n, from\nStannis’ retinue, but ignores the challenge. On the steps up, he runs into \nSam\n before finally arriving at the King's\nTower.\nStannis has been unsuccessful in seeking allegiance from the lords of the North; the latest rejection letter is from\nLyanna Mormont\n. So far, the only house to have declared for him is \nHouse Karstark\n. Stannis asks for gold from the\nNight's Watch to pay off \nSalladhor Saan\n. Jon recommends he take \nWhite Harbor\n for that, but Stannis dismisses its\nlord, \nWyman Manderly\n, as fat and useless. With \nwildling\n refugees still seeking shelter south of the wall, they\ndiscuss \nMance Rayder\n, whom Stannis intends to burn as a deserter, his wife's sister \nVal\n, and his child. Jon mentions\nthat \nGilly\n is acting as wet nurse for her own child and Mance's, and that he plans to send her and her babe away\nsouth. Stannis approves once he learns that Gilly's child was born of incest.\nStannis is demanding lands and castles from the Night's Watch. Jon has already ceded land in The Gift, and refuses\nto let him have the castles. He offers instead to have his own officers man the abandoned forts, to command Stannis'\nmen as a garrison. Stannis grumbles and threatens Jon before allowing him to leave. \nMelisandre\n, the priestess of\nR'hllor\n, follows Jon out from the meeting. Jon is wary of her but she warns him not to refuse her friendship, saying\nthat she has seen him in her visions. Underneath the Wall, she tells him to be wary of foes behind his back and\ndaggers in the dark. Jon assures her he is aware he has enemies in the Watch, to which Melisandre replies \n\"You\nknow nothing, Jon Snow\"\n.\nNavigation:\nJon XII\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nDaenerys I\n ←\nJon I\n→ \nBran I\n↓\nJon II\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 4: Bran I\nPlace(s): \nhaunted forest\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran IV\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nJon I\n ←\nBran I\n→ \nTyrion II\n↓\nBran II\nSynopsis\nBran\n is making his way through the \nhaunted forest\n, in search of the \nthree-eyed crow\n, accompanied by the Reeds,\nHodor\n, and \nColdhands\n.
