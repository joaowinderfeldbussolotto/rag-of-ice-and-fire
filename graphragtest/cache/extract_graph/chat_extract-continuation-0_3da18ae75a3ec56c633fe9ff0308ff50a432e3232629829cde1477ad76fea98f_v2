For this Arya is promised the reward of sharing\na crisp capron with Weese that night. As she runs errands, she searches for \nJaqen H'ghar\n to give him another name\nbefore he leaves. She finally asks a gate guard and is told that Ser \nAmory Lorch\n is to be castellan of \nHarrenhal\n, so\nJaqen will not be leaving. The \nBrave Companions\n will also be left to do foraging. Unfortunately, the Mountain will\nbe leaving to command Tywin’s van in battle, putting him, \nDunsen\n, \nPolliver\n, and \nRafford\n beyond reach.\nWeese gives Arya a message for \nLucan\n that Ser \nLyonel\n, who is to ride with \nKevan Lannister\n, needs a new sword.\nWhen she reaches the armory she spies \nGendry\n and asks him which one of the men is Lucan, he tells her that \nHot\nPie\n asked him if he heard her scream \nWinterfell\n when they were fighting on the wall. Arya immediately claims she\ndidn’t and Gendry tells her she did, but that he told Hot Pie he needs to clean out his ears because she yelled “Go to\nhell” and she better have the same story; she does not want Hot Pie to know who she really is, and thinks maybe she\nshould give Jaqen his name. Gendry gets Lucan, who pulls down a longsword and gives it to Arya with the message\nthat it is too good for such an oaf. Arya claims she will pass on the message, but will not because Weese would beat\nher bloody. The longsword feels good in Arya’s hand, although a lot heavier than \nNeedle\n, and she thinks that she\nmay not be a \nWater Dancer\n but she is not a mouse either. She considers using the note to get a horse, pretending she\nis doing it for Ser Lyonel since the stableboys are not able to read.\nShe is trying to decide whether to take the chance when she overhears some archers talk. One says that Robb\nbrought giants from the north, another that Starks are more like wolves than men, and then one states that Robb is\nscared to attack Harrenhal, and would piss in his pants if he knew they were coming. One man comments that\nmaybe they are the ones that should run. She thinks that yes, they should run or her brother will kill them. She is\ninterrupted by Weese, who has come up in front of her and she did not see him. He complains that she took long\nenough, and snatches the sword from her, slapping her with the back of his hand and telling her next time she will be\nfaster. She was a wolf and suddenly is not. He asks her if she wants another slap, and tells her he wants none of her\ninsolent looks, and to tell \nTuffleberry\n he has barrels for him but he needs to send lads to fetch them. He then warns\nher to run if she wants to eat tonight, and not to get lost again or she will be beat bloody.\n\nHalfway to the brewhouse, she runs into \nRorge\n and three other of Ser Amory’s men. He calls her “Yoren’s little\ncunt” and recalls that he promised to fuck her with her stick, saying she is no longer so brave now that he is not\nwearing chains. When she tells him she is looking for Jaqen, she can see something in his eyes, possibly fear. He\ntells her he is in the bathhouse and to get out of his way. In the bathhouse, she tries to sneak up on Jaqen, but he\nknows she is there, telling her the scuff of leather on stone is as loud as warhorns to a man with open ears, and\nclever girls go barefoot. She is upset that he heard her, and whispers Weese’s name in his ear. He states that a man\nwill attend him at his leisure.\nShe gives Tuffleberry the message and he curses, saying his lads are busy and that he will have those barrels within\nan hour, or Lord Tywin will hear of it. Weese is not happy about this message, but finds six men.\nSupper is a thin stew, and Weese shares his capon with a woman who has been sleeping with him. When he sees\nArya staring, he reminds her he told her what would happen if he caught her staring. He slaps her, then shoves her\nand her dress catches on a loose nail and rips. Weese commands her to fix that before she sleeps.\nShe is kicked awake in the morning by Weese, who tells them that the work will not get easier now that Tywin’s\nhost is gone. Later, Arya watches as Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan pass, followed by their great lords and captains.\nLast comes \nGregor Clegane\n, with \nPolliver\n beside him wearing Gendry’s helmet. Suddenly Arya realizes she was\nstupid and that neither \nChiswyck\n nor \nWeese\n mattered. Why didn’t she say Lord Tywin? She hurries to find Jaqen to\ntell him.\nShe hears a shriek of pain, and finds a dozen people looking at the body of Weese with his ugly dog on his chest.\nEvery so often the dog rips a mouthful of flesh off his face\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WEESE<|>PERSON<|>A man who interacts with Arya, shares food with her, and abuses her physically)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl running errands, searching for Jaqen H'ghar, and interacting with various characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAQEN H'GHAR<|>PERSON<|>A mysterious figure Arya seeks to give a name before he leaves)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER AMORY LORCH<|>PERSON<|>A knight appointed as castellan of Harrenhal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRENHAL<|>GEO<|>A castle where Ser Amory Lorch is appointed castellan and where the Brave Companions are stationed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MOUNTAIN<|>PERSON<|>A warrior leaving to command Tywin’s van in battle, likely referring to Gregor Clegane)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNSEN<|>PERSON<|>A man associated with the Mountain and part of Tywin’s forces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLLIVER<|>PERSON<|>A man associated with the Mountain and part of Tywin’s forces, later seen wearing Gendry’s helmet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAFFORD<|>PERSON<|>A man associated with the Mountain and part of Tywin’s forces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCAN<|>PERSON<|>A person for whom Arya delivers a message about a sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER LYONEL<|>PERSON<|>A knight who needs a new sword and is to ride with Kevan Lannister)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEVAN LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>A member of House Lannister, likely a commander or leader)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDRY<|>PERSON<|>A young man Arya interacts with in the armory, associated with Hot Pie and Needle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT PIE<|>PERSON<|>A friend of Gendry who asks about Arya’s scream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>A location referenced by Arya in her interaction with Gendry and Hot Pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEEDLE<|>GEO<|>A sword mentioned by Arya, likely her personal weapon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER DANCER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A term Arya thinks about, possibly referring to a group or skill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBB<|>PERSON<|>A leader bringing giants from the north, likely Robb Stark)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TUFFLEBERRY<|>PERSON<|>A man Weese mentions who needs barrels fetched)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RORGE<|>PERSON<|>A man who threatens Arya and mentions Jaqen H'ghar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREGOR CLEGANE<|>PERSON<|>A warrior also known as the Mountain, seen with Polliver)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHISWYCK<|>PERSON<|>A person Arya considers naming to Jaqen H'ghar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORD TYWIN<|>PERSON<|>A high-ranking leader, likely Tywin Lannister, who Arya considers naming to Jaqen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BRAVE COMPANIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group left to do foraging at Harrenhal)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WEESE<|>Arya interacts with Weese, who abuses her and gives her tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>JAQEN H'GHAR<|>Arya seeks Jaqen to give him a name and later whispers Weese’s name to him<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER AMORY LORCH<|>HARRENHAL<|>Ser Amory Lorch is appointed castellan of Harrenhal<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE MOUNTAIN<|>TYWIN<|>The Mountain commands Tywin’s van in battle<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLLIVER<|>GREGOR CLEGANE<|>Polliver is seen with Gregor Clegane, wearing Gendry’s helmet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>GENDRY<|>Arya interacts with Gendry in the armory and discusses Hot Pie<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>HOT PIE<|>Hot Pie asks Gendry about Arya’s scream, and Arya wants to hide her identity from him<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>NEEDLE<|>Arya compares the longsword to Needle, her personal weapon<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>ROBB<|>Arya thinks about her brother Robb and his actions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEESE<|>TUFFLEBERRY<|>Weese tells Arya to deliver a message to Tuffleberry about barrels<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>RORGE<|>Rorge threatens Arya and mentions Jaqen H'ghar<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>LORD TYWIN<|>Arya considers naming Lord Tywin to Jaqen H'ghar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>CHISWYCK<|>Arya considers naming Chiswyck to Jaqen H'ghar<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEESE<|>ARYA<|>Weese is killed, and his body is found with his dog on his chest<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
