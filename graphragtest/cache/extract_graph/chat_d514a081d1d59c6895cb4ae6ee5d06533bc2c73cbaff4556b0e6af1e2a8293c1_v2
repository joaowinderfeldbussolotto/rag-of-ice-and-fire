She also hears from Weese that \nStannis Baratheon\nand \nRenly Baratheon\n are both kings and have joined the fighting. Many of the Lannister men question how long\nJoffrey can hold the throne, protected only by \nGold Cloaks\n and ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf and a woman. There have\nalso been a number of reports of \nBeric Dondarrion\n being killed by the \nBloody Mummers\n, but he has already\nsupposedly been killed by \nAmory Lorch\n at \nRushing Falls\n, and twice by the Mountain.\n\nA fortnight later, the queerest collection of men Arya has ever seen arrives, the Bloody Mummers. Weese assures\nher that she does not want to know them, and is told they are called The Footmen, Toes of the Goat, and Lord\nTywin’s Bloody Mummers. They call themselves the Brave Companions and their leader is the very tall, stick thin\nVargo Hoat\n. They are housed in the Widow’s Tower, for which Arya is thankful. On their first night, Ser \nHarys\nSwyft\n’s squire is killed and two of the Bloody Mummers are wounded. Tywin hangs both along with one of Lord\nLewys Lydden\n’s archers who is supposed to have started the trouble. They do not stay long, but before they leave\nshe hears that \nRoose Bolton\n has occupied the \nRuby Ford\n and her brother is in \nRiverrun\n, which is much closer than\nWinterfell but she does not know where it lies in relation to Harrenhal; if only she could get away.\nShe learns that there are captives from the \nBattle of the Green Fork\n. They have been given freedom of the castle in\nreturn for a pledge that they will not attempt to escape, but Arya is hoping they can help her escape. There are three\nFrey brothers and their bastard brother, but they are soon ransomed. There is also a very fat lordling who is always\nin the kitchen, one that wears a black cloak with white suns, and Lord \nMedger Cerwyn\n, whom she recognizes. She\nfigures she can get aid from Lord Cerwyn, but learns later that he died from his wounds.\nArya hears all sorts of rumors about Lord Tywin’s plans. Lord Tywin spends his days with his war council. Arya\noften catches sight of him, and thinks he is strong looking for an old man, and his face reminds her of her father,\nalthough they look nothing alike, and she could never picture Tywin laughing.\nSer \nAmory Lorch\n arrives one afternoon, looking less frightening in the daylight. He has fewer men than she\nremembers and many wounded. She is told that they rode all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and\nslaying rebels. Arya figures they are talking about the men of the \nNight's Watch\n. At the end of the column she sees\nJaqen H'ghar\n, \nRorge\n and \nBiter\n with his body covered in half-healed wounds. Jaqen H’ghar still smiles, and his\nclothes are filthy, but his hair washed and brushed. His eyes pass right over Arya, and she thinks he did not even\nnotice her. Arya thinks that Gendry was right and she should have let them die. That night, she says the names\nagain: \nWeese\n, \nDunsen\n, \nChiswyck\n, \nPolliver\n, \nRaff\n the Sweetling, the \nTickler\n, \nthe Hound\n, Ser \nGregor\n, Ser \nAmory\nLorch\n, Ser \nIlyn\n, Ser \nMeryn\n, and King \nJoffrey\n and \nQueen Cersei\n. She thinks she might add three names to the list,\nbut she is too tired to decide.\nShe is dreaming of wolves in the wild when she wakes with Jaqen H’ghar’s hand over her mouth. He notes that the\nboy Arry became a girl and revealing that he did see her that afternoon. He then explains that she saved three lives,\nthus he has to repay her by taking three lives of her choice, in order to appease the \nRed God\n. When Arya asks him to\ntake her to Riverrun, he replies that he will take three lives for her, nothing more, and gives her some time to decide\nwhom to kill. Then, he leaves before she can even light her candle.\nThe next morning, Arya yawns in Weese’s presence, and he warns her not to let her mouth drop open again, telling\nher he will feed her tongue to his bitch, and twists her ear to make certain she heard. As she works, she thinks of\nwhom she wants dead, and that, being at war, she should try to kill as many Lannisters as she could, but her father\npersonally killed those he condemned to death. She is not sure she should trust Jaqen, and avoids him for a while,\nwhich is not hard to do.\nSer Gregor returns, and Weese sends Arya to see if they have clothes that need mending. She arrives to find\nChiswyck talking, and does not want to interrupt because she might be hit. He is talking about when he was\nreturning from the \nTourney of the Hand\n with Ser Gregor, Raff, \nJoss Stilwood\n, and \nEggon\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d514a081d1d59c6895cb4ae6ee5d06533bc2c73cbaff4556b0e6af1e2a8293c1_v2"}
