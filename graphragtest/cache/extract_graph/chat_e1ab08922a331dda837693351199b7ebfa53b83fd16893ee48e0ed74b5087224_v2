Rodrik agrees, but in the\nprocess he calls her “my lady” again, and comments on how old ways die hard when he realizes his mistake.\nIn the long and drafty common room the benches are crowded with a wide variety of people, but Catelyn doesn't see\nanyone who might recognize her. Ser Rodrik finds them a place by the kitchen where they are accosted by the singer\nMarillion\n, who asks about where they come from and where they are going. Catelyn answers the safest of the\nquestions, saying they come from \nKing's Landing\n. The singer tells them that is his destination for the \nTourney of the\n\nHand\n. The singer is disappointed when Catelyn has not heard about him, and proceeds to attempt to get paid silver\nfor a song. Ser Rodrik, believing that any healthy boy would prefer a sword to a lyre, tells him he might have a\ncouple of coppers but would prefer tossing them down a well to hearing the boy’s howling. The singer then tells\nhow he was made to sing for kings and high lords. Catelyn asks if Marillion has ever played for Lord Tully. The\nsinger boasts that a chamber is kept for him at Riverrun and that the young Lord Tully is like a brother. This amuses\nCatelyn, who knows her brother has hated singers ever since one bedded a girl he liked.\nIt is then that the door bangs open and the arrival of \nTyrion Lannister\n is announced, with a demand for room and a\nbath for Tyrion. When Tyrion is told that there are no rooms, he announces that his servants can sleep in the stable,\nand quips that he needs only a small room. When Masha Heddle repeats that there are no rooms, Tyrion takes a gold\ncoin and flips it into the air. A free rider tells Tyrion he is welcome to his take his room, and Tyrion flips the coin to\nthe man.\nTyrion declares that he wants some sort of roast fowl and the best wine sent up to his room, and asks the \nblack\nbrother\n \nYoren\n to join him. Marillion the singer stands and offers to sing to Tyrion of his father’s \nvictory\n at King's\nLanding while he dines. Tyrion replies that such a song would surely ruin his supper. He is about to turn away when\nhis eyes find Catelyn, and he comments that he was sorry to have missed her at Winterfell. Everyone in the inn is\nastonished, and every eye is turned to Catelyn as she stands.\nCatelyn decides to play her hand. She asks some of the men-at-arms in the room directly if their lords are true to her\nfather, Lord Hoster Tully. The \nBrackens\n, \nFreys\n, and \nWhents\n are all represented in the room, and all answer with\npolite agreement. Tyrion is confused and asks what Catelyn is doing, even sniggering at one of the comments.\nCatelyn then tells the bannermen that Tyrion, while a \nguest\n in her home, sent an assassin to murder \nher son\n in his\nbed. In the name of King \nRobert\n and the lords they serve, Catelyn calls upon them to seize Tyrion and return him to\nWinterfell to await the king’s justice.\nCatelyn cannot decide which is more satisfying: the sound of a dozen men drawing their swords or the look on\nTyrion Lannister’s face.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn IV\n↑\nEddard VI\n ←\nCatelyn V\n→ \nSansa II\n↓\nCatelyn VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 29: Sansa II\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa I\n↑\nCatelyn V\n ←\nSansa II\n→ \nEddard VII\n↓\nSansa III\nSansa\n is enthralled by the \ntourney\n, especially the knights. Ser \nGregor Clegane\n kills a new-made knight named Ser\nHugh\n in a joust, and after a victory Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n gives her a rose. During the feast that follows, Prince \nJoffrey\n is\nvery courteous, but afterward he orders \nthe Hound\n to escort Sansa back to her chambers. When the Hound notices\nSansa is avoiding looking at his burned face, he forces her to look and tells her how he acquired it.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n rides to \nthe Hand's tourney\n in a litter with \nSepta\n \nMordane\n and \nJeyne Poole\n. The splendor takes Sansa’s breath\naway, the knights most of all. All of the \nKingsguard\n are there in pure white cloaks and armor except Ser \nJaime\nLannister\n, the Kingslayer, who wears his famous gilded armor. The gigantic Ser \nGregor Clegane\n thunders past like\nan avalanche. Sansa also spies \nYohn Royce\n and whispers to Jeyne that he wears bronze armor that is thousands of\nyears old, engraved in runes that protect the wearer. Septa Mordane points out Lord \nJason Mallister\n in an eagle-\nwinged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor. The girls giggle at the warrior-priest \nThoros of Myr\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e1ab08922a331dda837693351199b7ebfa53b83fd16893ee48e0ed74b5087224_v2"}
