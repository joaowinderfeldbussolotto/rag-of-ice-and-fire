They also joined with \nDywen\n, \nEdd\n and \nGiant\n, survivors from the Bridge of Skulls where \nBowen Marsh\n held\nback the \nWeeper\n's advance. Sam is happy to be reunited with \nJon\n, although he is wary of King \nStannis\n's army being\npresent at Castle Black. It was the king who defeated the \nwildlings\n, scattering their remnants back into the \nhaunted\nforest\n. \nVal\n wants to bring her sister's baby to Mance, but Jon tells her that only Maester \nAemon\n is permitted to see\nthe imprisoned wildling king. Alone, Sam asks Jon, \"Could there be honor in a lie, if it were told for a good\npurpose?\" Sam is considering sending Gilly and her son to \nHorn Hill\n, with a letter claiming that he fathered the boy.\nJon reveals that \nSlynt\n still considers him a traitor, because he did not kill Mance as he was sent to do. Sam\nremembers swearing to \nBran\n and \nJojen Reed\n not to reveal to anyone, even Jon, that Bran is still alive. \nColdhands\n'\nlast words to Sam were, \"Let the world believe the boy is dead. We want no seekers coming after us. Swear it,\nSamwell of the Night's Watch. Swear it for the life you owe me.\" And Sam has kept his vows to all three. Later,\nSam considers the last vote for a new Lord Commander, with Ser Denys Mallister still leading, but no one near the\nmajority. At dinner, Bowen Marsh withdraws his name from the voting, and backs Janos Slynt. When the votes are\ntallied that night, both Ser Denys and \nCotter Pyke\n have lost votes, and Slynt has gained on both of them. Sitting with\nGrenn\n, \nPyp\n and Dolorous Edd, Pyp suggests that if Sam were to persuade either Ser Denys or Cotter Pyke to set\naside their quarrels and back the other, a new Lord Commander could be decided. Preferably one who would be\nbeneficial to the Watch, so long as it was not Janos Slynt.\nNavigation:\nSamwell III\n↑\nArya XIII\n ←\nSamwell IV\n→ \nJon XI\n↓\nSamwell V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 76: Jon XI\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon X\n↑\nSamwell IV\n ←\nJon XI\n→ \nTyrion XI\n↓\nJon XII\nSynopsis\nJon\n is training with \nSatin\n in the yard, when \nMelisandre\n arrives to take him before \nStannis\n.
