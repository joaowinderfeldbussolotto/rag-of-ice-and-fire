It\nis agreed and Stevron’s brother, Ser \nPerwyn Frey\n, remains as a hostage to her fair treatment.\nThe frail 90-year-old Lord Walder Frey meets Catelyn in the great hall with all but one (the hostage, Perwyn) of his\n21 sons, 36 grandsons, and countless other descendants. Walder is impolite and direct; even some of his sons point\nout his impoliteness, but he does not respond well to their criticism. Catelyn knows that she has to be careful with\nher words and explains that she is there to ask him to open his gates so they can proceed to Riverrun where she\nwould have expected to find him. Lord Walder insists that he was still gathering his strength when her brother lost\nthe battle. Catelyn doubts Lord Walder’s version of events, but does not press the issue. She asks that they talk\nprivately, and Lord Walder commands all the others to leave.\nOnce they are alone, Lord Walder declares that his descendants are all waiting for him to die, then he asks why he\nshould let Robb’s host cross. When Catelyn makes a very subtle threat about the size of Robb’s army, Lord Walder\nretorts that her son’s army will be 20,000 fresh corpses when the Lannisters arrive. When Catelyn reminds Lord\nWalder of his vows to \nHouse Tully\n, the old man counters that he also swore allegiance to the king, making her and\nher son nothing but rebels. Lord Walder then takes his turn at threatening: if he had the sense the gods gave a fish he\nwould deny them the crossing and let the Lannisters have them. However, the old man quickly reveals that he does\nnot care for the Lannisters either, with their gold, their lions, and their arrogant pride. Lord Walder goes on to say\nthat if the Lannisters want his help they must \nask\n. Catelyn humbly stresses that \nshe\n is asking, as are her father, her\nbrother, her sons, and her husband with her voice.\nWalder complains about her father insulting him by not being present for his last few weddings; an insult despite\nLord Hoster’s failing health. The old man complains about Lord Hoster not marrying Edmure to one of his\ndaughters, then he complains about how his heirs were defeated in a tourney he attended. He also complains that \nJon\nArryn\n would not foster two of his grandsons, or let him foster \nRobert Arryn\n. When Lord Arryn announced that his\nson was going to be fostered with Lord \nStannis\n, \nLysa\n stormed off and all the Jon could do was apologize. Catelyn\nasks if it was not Lord Tywin that Robert Arryn was to be fostered with, but Lord Walder insists that he knows the\ndifference between Stannis and Tywin. Then Lord Walder asks again why he should allow them to cross and the\nhaggling begins.\nCatelyn returns to Robb followed by Ser \nJared Frey\n, Ser \nHosteen Frey\n, Ser \nDanwell Frey\n, Walder’s bastard \nRonel\nRivers\n, and a long column of pikemen. She tells Robb that he has been granted the crossing and that all but 400 of\nLord Frey’s forces will join his army. In exchange, two of Lord Walder’s grandsons will be fostered by the Starks at\nWinterfell\n, \nOlyvar Frey\n will become Robb’s squire, Arya will marry Walder’s youngest son \nElmar\n, and Robb\nhimself will marry his choice of Lord Walder’s daughters when the fighting is done. Robb, realizing he has no\nchoice if he wants to cross, consents. Catelyn suggests that he should leave 400 archers and swordsmen at the Twins\nto ensure Lord Walder keeps faith under a reliable man. Robb suggests Ser \nHelman Tallhart\n and Catelyn agrees.\nRobb and his cavalry cross that evening as Lord Walder Frey watches from a litter while \nRoose Bolton\n and the\ninfantry stay on the east bank to march south and confront Lord Tywin.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VIII\n↑\nEddard XV\n ←\nCatelyn IX\n→ \nJon VIII\n↓\nCatelyn X\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 60: Jon VIII\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon VII\n↑\nCatelyn IX\n ←\nJon VIII\n→ \nDaenerys VII\n↓\nJon IX\nJon\n is presented with the \nValyrian steel\n sword \nLongclaw\n by \nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n.
