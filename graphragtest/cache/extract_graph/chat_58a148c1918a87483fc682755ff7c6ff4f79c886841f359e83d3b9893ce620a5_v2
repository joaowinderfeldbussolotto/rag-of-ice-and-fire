He declares that the battle is lost, and orders her to gather as many survivors as she\ncan and escape through the tunnel under the barn. Quick as that, he storms off again to rejoin the fighting. Arya\ngrabs Gendry and explains the plan. They call Hot Pie down from the walk and find Lommy bleeding from a spear\nwound in his calf. They find find Gerren too, but he is too seriously wounded. The crying girl will not walk, even\nwhen slapped, so Arya has to drag her while the others race ahead.\nThe barn is on fire when she arrives, and Hot Pie urges her to just leave the girl behind, but Arya stubbornly\ncontinues to drag her. Hot Pie abandons them and scuttles back inside, but Gendry comes back to hoist the girl over\nhis shoulder. The barn feels like a furnace. The back wall is ablaze and the animals are kicking and screaming.\nInside their wagon, \nBiter\n and Rorge struggle frantically to get free while Jaqen H'ghar calls out to Arya in his\nfriendly voice. The trap door is only a few feet ahead and the fire is spreading fast, which reminds Arya of \nthe\nHound\n's horrible burned face. Gendry wonders how to get the little girl through the narrow tunnel. Arya tells him to\npush her and asks where he left the axe. Eying the prisoners, Gendry says it is by the haven but he would save the\nanimals first. Arya tells him to go ahead with the girl and goes to get the axe.\nOutside, she sees Koss killed on the spot after he yields. There is no sign of Yoren, but the axe is where Gendry left\nit. As she wrenches it loose, a mailed hand grabs her arm. Spinning, she drives the axe up between the man's legs,\nthen dashes back to the barn. With heavy smoke pouring out and the animals screaming within, going back into the\nbarn is the hardest thing she has ever done. Inside, the roof has caught fire as well, and flaming bits of wood and\nstraw are raining down. The smoke is so thick she cannot see the wagon, so she crawls toward Biter's screams.\nFinding the wagon, she throws the axe in and runs for the tunnel. Rorge catches it and starts hacking at the wagon.\nArya hears the wagon splinter just before she rolls headfirst into the tunnel. She drops five feet and gets dirt in her\nmouth, but she does not care. She has crawled only a dozen feet when she hears the barn crash, sending a cloud of\nhot smoke and black dust billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. She holds her breath and kisses the mud on the\nfloor. Then she cries, but she does not know for whom.\nNavigation:\nArya III\n↑\nJon II\n ←\nArya IV\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nArya V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 15: Tyrion III\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n↑\nArya IV\n ←\nTyrion III\n→ \nBran II\n↓\nTyrion IV\nThe \nsmall council\n discusses \nStannis\n's declaration that \nCersei\n's children are bastards born of incest. Cersei wants the\nletters suppressed, but \nTyrion\n and \nLittlefinger\n convince her they should treat the letters with contempt whilst\nspreading their own rumor that Stannis' \ndaughter\n is illegitimate. Tyrion leaves the council to meet with city's smiths\nto commission an immense chain, then meets with \nVarys\n via a secret passage in a \nbrothel\n.\nSynopsis\nCersei Lannister\n is furious upon learning that \nStannis Baratheon\n is circulating letters accusing her of incest. The\nsmall council\n has two copies of the proclamation: one received by \nMaester\n \nFrenken\n at Castle \nStokeworth\n and a\nsecond received by Lord \nGyles Rosby\n. \nLittlefinger\n notes that if Stannis sent letters to them, every other lord in the\nSeven Kingdoms\n has seen a copy. Cersei wants every copy burned so that neither \nher father\n nor \nJoffrey\n learns of\nthem, but \nTyrion Lannister\n points out copies have likely been sent to \nHarrenhal\n and \nCasterly Rock\n as well and the\nsecret is out. When Cersei rages that she is being accused of incest, adultery, and treason, Tyrion is impressed by her\nacting skills since he knows the accusations are perfectly true. He points out that such claims are to be expected\nsince Stannis needs a pretext to justify his rebellion. When Cersei insists she will not be called a whore, Tyrion only\nthinks that Stannis never claimed \nJaime\n paid her.\nGlancing back over the letter, Tyrion points out the strange words \"Done in the \nLight of the Lord\n.\" \nGrand Maester\nPycelle\n explains it is a term commonly used in \nFree Cities\n, and Littlefinger notes that \nVarys\n, who is absent for\nreasons known only to Tyrion, reported years ago that Stannis' wife \nSelyse\n took up with a \nred priest\n. Tyrion notes\nthat this can be used as propaganda against Stannis\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_58a148c1918a87483fc682755ff7c6ff4f79c886841f359e83d3b9893ce620a5_v2"}
