As she speaks to Cohollo, Daenerys recalls that the \nkhal’s\nthree bloodriders are his sworn brothers who share everything with him except his horses. Daenerys is glad that\nDrogo does not hold to the tradition of sharing \nher\n with his bloodriders because some of them frighten her.\nBloodriders are bound to their \nkhal\n for life and die when he dies, living only long enough to avenge him if required.\nDaenerys finds herself wishing \nher father\n was guarded by such men, remembering the stories of \nthe Kingslayer\n who\nmurdered her father and Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n who went over to \nthe Usurper\n.\nDaenerys, who is tiring easily as her child grows, is looking forward to a night of rest. She is led to one of the\nhollow hills that has been prepared for her. She decides to give her brother his gifts tonight. She has prepared\nViserys several sets of clothes that she hopes will help him earn the respect of the Dothraki. She also intends the\ngifts as a way of apologizing for shaming him. Daenerys orders \nDoreah\n to invite him to supper and \nIrri\n to go to the\nmarket to buy something other than horse meat, which Viserys hates.\nViserys soon arrives, dragging Doreah by the arm, furious that Daenerys would presume to give him commands.\nDaenerys attempts to explain that Doreah misspoke, then shows Viserys the clothes she has had made for him.\nViserys only sneers at the clothes, calling them Dothraki rags. Her brother goes on to ridicule her for presuming to\ndress him and suggests spitefully that next Daenerys will want to braid his hair. Daenerys declares that he has no\nright to a braid because he has won no victories.\nViserys grabs her by the arm, hurting her, and for a moment Daenerys is a scared little girl again. Then she grabs\nhold of the first thing she touches, a medallion belt she meant to give Viserys, and swings it with all her strength.\nThe belt hits her brother full in the face and leaves a deep cut. Daenerys tells Viserys to leave and pray that Drogo\ndoes not hear of this. Viserys leaves in a fury, telling her that when he comes into his \nkingdom\n she will regret this\nday.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys III\n↑\nEddard IX\n ←\nDaenerys IV\n→ \nBran V\n↓\nDaenerys V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 37: Bran V\nPlace(s): \nOutside \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran IV\n↑\nDaenerys IV\n ←\nBran V\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\nBran VI\nDuring his first ride outside \nWinterfell\n since his fall, \nBran\n learns of \nJaime Lannister\n’s \nattack\n on \nhis father\n. \nRobb\ngoes ahead to find the \ndirewolves\n and Bran is attacked by six outlaws. Robb returns with the direwolves and defeats\nall but one. The last man holds a dagger to Bran’s throat until \nTheon\n kills him with an arrow from behind. \nOsha\n, the\nonly survivor, is taken captive.\nSynopsis\nBran\n is finally getting to ride outside of the castle in the oversize saddle that \nTyrion Lannister\n designed for him. He\nhas been riding a horse he named \nDancer\n in the yard for the past fortnight, getting bolder each time. With his legs\nunable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse makes him unsteady at first, but the straps around his chest and\nthighs prevent him from falling. Soon Bran gets into the rhythm and his anxiety fades into a tremulous smile.\nBran would have preferred to have gone out with just \nRobb\n, but neither \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n nor the new Captain of\nGuard, \nHallis Mollen\n, would allow it. The party includes Robb, \nJoseth\n the Master of Horse, \nTheon Greyjoy\n, Maester\nLuwin, and the \ndirewolves\n \nSummer\n and \nGrey Wind\n. As they pass through the village, Theon calls out to two serving\nwenches by the ale house. \nOne\n blushes and Theon declares to Robb that she squirms like a weasel in bed but blushes\nif you say anything to her in the street. Before Theon can continue his ribald story, Robb insists he not talk about\nsuch things around Bran. Bran notes that Robb seems to admire Theon, but Bran has never warmed to him.\nBran asks to go faster, and Robb agrees and spurs his own horse. Bran brings Dancer to a gallop, and catches up to\nRobb at the edge of the \nwolfswood\n. Bran exclaims his excitement at being able to ride, and Robb smiles, but Bran\ncan tell something is bothering his brother. Robb notes that something is bothering the direwolves as well before\nadmitting there was a raven the night before. The news recently from the ravens has not been good: \nUncle Benjen\nhas still not been found and \ntheir mother\n has taken \nTyrion Lannister\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ddc3514fbaae956b5d87972403374607e469ee413f8fc9936eab5d7642ce311f_v2"}
