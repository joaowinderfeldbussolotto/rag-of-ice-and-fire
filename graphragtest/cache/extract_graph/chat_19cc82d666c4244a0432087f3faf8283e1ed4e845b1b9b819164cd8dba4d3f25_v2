Arya is surprised when Eddard says\nshe looks like her aunt, who was always described as beautiful, something never said of Arya.\nEddard asks if Arya knows anything about how to use a sword, and she replies with the advice Jon gave her: “Stick\n'em with the pointy end.” She tells how she was trying to learn and sadly adds that she asked Mycah to practice with\nher. In grief she starts to sob against her father’s chest. He tells her that Mycah’s death was not her fault. Arya sobs\nthat she hates them all: the \nQueen\n, the Hound, Joffrey, and the King. Then she adds that Joffery lied, and that she\n\nalso hates Sansa.\nEddard says that everyone lies and that he does not believe that \nNymeria\n ran off. Arya then exclaims that Jory\npromised not to tell. Eddard informs her that Jory did not tell but that he had figured it out, because even a blind man\ncould tell that the wolf would not have left willingly. Arya then explains how she and Jory had to throw rocks to\ndrive the wolf away. She then asks her father if she did the right thing and Eddard assures her that she did.\nEddard then tells Arya that winter is coming. He explains to her how wolves stick together, and that in the winter a\nlone wolf dies. Now there are enemies threatening the \nStarks\n, so they must stick together like a pack of wolves and it\nis time for her to start growing up. He hands Arya back her sword, saying she can keep it; he only asks that she not\nstick her sister.\nThree days later, Arya is sent to the Small Hall by the \nsteward\n. She is met by \nSyrio Forel\n, a former \nFirst Sword\n of\nBraavos\n. He tells her that he is her dancing master, and throws her a wooden sword, which she cannot catch.\nUnperturbed, Syrion tells Arya that the next day she will be there at midday and catch the blade. She picks the\npractice sword up as instructed and finds that it is very heavy. When she complains about the weight, Syrio explains\nthat it is heavy to make her strong. Then he fixes her grip, telling her not to squeeze too tight. When Arya says that\nshe might drop it, Syrio tells her that the sword must become a part of her arm, and that she cannot drop a part of her\narm.\nWhen Syrio calls her a boy for the third time Arya objects. He insists that it does not matter; a sword has no gender.\nHe then explains that what he will be teaching her is not the hacking and hammering iron dance of \nWesteros\n, but the\nswift and sudden Water Dance of Braavos,. Then he tells her to try to strike him, and she tries unsuccessfully for\nfour hours until every muscle is sore. The next day the real work begins.\nNavigation:\nArya I\n↑\nTyrion III\n ←\nArya II\n→ \nDaenerys III\n↓\nArya III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 23: Daenerys III\nPlace(s): \nThe \nDothraki Sea\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nDaenerys III\n→ \nBran IV\n↓\nDaenerys IV\nDaenerys\n learns to embrace her life in \nDrogo\n's \nkhalasar\n, and stands up to \nViserys\n for the first time. Afterward, when\nDrogo arrives to have sex with her, she rides him instead of being taken from behind and becomes pregnant.\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n looks out for the first time onto the vast, empty, flat plain of the \nDothraki Sea\n with Ser \nJorah Mormont\nbeside her. Daenerys sees she has out-distanced the rest of \nDrogo\n’s \nkhalasar\n, who are still climbing the ridge behind\nher. Among them she can see her brother \nViserys\n struggling with his riding. The sight brings back the memory of\nIllyrio Mopatis\n offering to let Viserys stay in \nPentos\n as his guest. Viserys had refused and insisted on coming with\nthe \nkhalasar\n to ensure that Drogo would give him the army that he promised. Daenerys commands Jorah and the\nothers to wait. Mormont comments that Daenerys is starting to sound like a queen but Daenerys corrects him, calling\nherself a \nkhaleesi\n.\nAs she rides out alone, Daenerys reflects on how the days of the journey have hardened her body. She no longer has\nopen saddle sores nor does she suffer unbearable pain after a day’s ride. At first, Drogo would ignore Daenerys to\nspend his days talking, drinking, and racing with his \nbloodriders\n, leaving her to eat meals alone or with Viserys and\nJorah Mormont. Yet every night Drogo would come and ride her from behind. She had been miserable until she had\ndreamt of a dragon that engulfed her in flame and cleansed her. After that, each day had been easier than the one\nbefore it and she had found pleasure in the new sights of the journey, even starting to enjoy sex with Drogo.\nOnce she is totally alone, Daenery\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_19cc82d666c4244a0432087f3faf8283e1ed4e845b1b9b819164cd8dba4d3f25_v2"}
