Although Arianne has the utmost trust in \nGarin\n, \nDrey\n and \nSylva\n, she is still\nunsure about \nGerold Dayne\n the Darkstar. She considers his cruel nature and the mystery surrounding him. She is\nworried that \nArys\n may be wary of him. But if this would happen and they would to come to blows, who would win?\nGarin warns Arianne that he does not like the man, but she reminds him that they may need his sword and\neventually \nhis castle\n. Later, Darkstar tells her that this scheme to crown Myrcella will not work as she has planned.\nHe then unsheathes his sword, and reveals that you incite a war with steel (meaning they should kill Myrcella).\nWhen Arys and Princess Myrcella arrive, Arianne introduces the girl to her companions. Myrcella recalls the great\nknight \nArthur Dayne\n when she meets Darkstar, which seems to upset the Knight of \nHigh Hermitage\n, because in his\nmind people always remember his cousin for his famous sword. Arys draws Arianne off alone and reveals that\nTywin Lannister\n is dead.\nThey set off at night for the \nGreenblood\n, where they will take an orphan's barge west along the river. Myrcella is\nconfused, having been told nothing by Arys, especially the fact that everyone keeps calling her \"your Grace\".\nArianne tells her some of their plan, that they intend to crown her Queen, because her brother \nTommen\n was being\ncontrolled by evil councillors. During the trip, Myrcella asks Garin why they call him \"an orphan of the Greenblood\"\nwhen he has a mother and father. He explains that it is a metaphor for their mourning the loss of their homeland, and\nthe \"mother\" river the \nRhoyne\n. They built barges along the Greenblood and hammered them together, as they did in\ntheir ancestral land, for they were never comfortable in the deserts of Dorne.\nAs Arianne is considering her plan to crown Myrcella at \nHellholt\n, where \nEllaria Sand\n's father \nHarmen Uller\n rules,\nthey reach the river and spot the barge that Garin's people promised would be waiting. But as they get closer, \nAreo\nHotah\n steps from the cabin with a dozen crossbowmen. Arianne yells for them to flee, while Drey recommends they\nyield. But Arys Oakheart charges the boat, intent on protecting his two princesses at all costs. Hit with several bolts,\nhe reaches the deck but falls to Captain Hotah's longaxe. As Arianne falls off her horse screaming \"No!\", she hears\nMyrcella shrieking, and Hotah commanding horsemen to chase after Darkstar, who fled. Arianne notices Myrcella\non her hands and knees, her head in her hands and blood streaming down her arms. Then she is brought before\nHotah, pleading to know how her father discovered what she planned. The Captain of the Guards responds,\n\"Someone told.
