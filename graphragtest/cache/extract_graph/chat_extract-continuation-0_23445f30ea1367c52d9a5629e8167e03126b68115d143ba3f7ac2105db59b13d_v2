Lyanna had told him that Robert would never keep to one bed. Ned, who had already held Robert’s first\nbastard \ndaughter\n, assured her that Robert was a good man who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna responded\nthat one could not change a man’s nature. After what he has seen this night, Ned cannot say his sister was wrong.\nNed’s business at \nChataya's brothel\n was to meet the prostitute with \nRobert\n’s bastard daughter named \nBarra\n. The\nchild resembled Robert, and the girl was proud to show him that the baby had the king’s nose and hair. Ned still\nremembers that Robert’s firstborn had the same hair. The girl asked him to tell Robert how beautiful their daughter\nis, that she has not been with anyone else, and that she is waiting for him. Eddard vowed that she and the child\nwould be well cared for. As he rides, Ned reflects that he is cursed to always keep his promises, while Robert can\nswear undying love and forget it by the morning.\nNed thinks about \nJon Snow\n and wonders why the gods give men such lust only to frown on bastards. Ned then asks\nLittlefinger about Robert’s bastards. Littlefinger says he does not know exactly how many there are. He goes on to\nspeak in detail about Robert’s acknowledged bastard \nEdric Storm\n, the son of a \ncousin\n to the king’s \nsister-in-law\n.\nLittlefinger also speaks of a rumored pair of twins of a serving maid at \nCasterly Rock\n which \nCersei\n had killed. Ned\nis surprised that Robert would stand by and let such a thing happen, but then recalls that Robert seems to have\ngrown adept at shutting his eyes.\nNed asks why \nJon Arryn\n would suddenly take such an interest in Robert’s bastards. Littlefinger suggests that maybe\nRobert asked him to. Ned declares that Jon Arryn was killed for something more than that. Littlefinger says\nscornfully that maybe Lord Arryn had to be silenced for discovering Robert had bastard children, scoffing that next\nthe man might be audacious enough to claim the sun rises in the east. Ned thinks of \nRhaegar Targaryen\n for the first\ntime in years, and wonders if the Dragon Prince frequented brothels; somehow he thinks not.\nSuddenly they are surrounded by at least 20 \nLannister\n guardsmen. \nJaime Lannister\n rides up and declares that he is\nlooking for \nhis brother\n who apparently had \nsome trouble\n on the road. Ned tells him that \nCatelyn\n took Tyrion\n\nprisoner to answer for his crimes. This causes Littlefinger to groan in dismay and Jaime to move forward and draw\nhis sword. Jaime demands that Ned show his steel, declaring that he will butcher Ned but prefers it if Ned will fight\nback. Jaime then suggests Littlefinger leave if he does not want blood on his expensive clothes. Littlefinger needs no\nurging, but assures Ned that he will bring the \nCity Watch\n.\nThe Stark guardsmen have drawn their swords, but it is three against twenty, so Ned reminds Jaime that if he dies,\nCatelyn will kill Tyrion. Jaime doesn’t believe him but is unwilling to chance it, so he tells his men not to harm Ned.\nYet Jaime refuses to leave Ned entirely unchastened so he orders Ned’s guardsmen killed. Ned and his men are\nquickly overwhelmed and \nHeward\n and \nWyl\n are cut down. Jory manages to break free, but returns almost\nimmediately and is killed. In the confusion, Ned’s horse slips and falls and Ned is blinded by the pain of his leg\nbreaking.\nWhen he opens his eyes again, Ned drags himself through the mud. When Littlefinger and the gold cloaks finally\narrive they find him cradling Jory’s dead body. He is returned in horrid pain to the \nTower of the Hand\n, where Grand\nMaester\n \nPycelle\n attends to his injury.\nNavigation:\nEddard VIII\n↑\nCatelyn VI\n ←\nEddard IX\n→ \nDaenerys IV\n↓\nEddard X\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 36: Daenerys IV\nPlace(s): \nVaes Dothrak\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys III\n↑\nEddard IX\n ←\nDaenerys IV\n→ \nBran V\n↓\nDaenerys V\nThe \nkhalasar\n enters \nVaes Dothrak\n.
