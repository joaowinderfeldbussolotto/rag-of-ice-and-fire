Sansa is being beaten by \nBoros\nBlount\n when \nTyrion Lannister\n arrives. He stops the beating and has her taken to the \nTower of the Hand\n to be\ncleaned up and treated. The next morning he offers her protection, but she refuses.\nSynopsis\nSandor Clegane\n is telling \nSansa\n that if she keeps \nJoffrey\n waiting it will only be worse. As Sansa is making herself\npretty for Joffrey, she wonders if Joffrey has heard about her meetings with Ser \nDontos\n. As they are walking, Sansa\nasks the \nHound\n what she has done and is told that it is what her kingly brother \nRobb Stark\n has done. Sansa tells the\nHound that Robb is the traitor and she had no part; she can only think that if Robb harmed \nJaime Lannister\n she will\nhave to face Ser \nIlyn Payne\n. The Hound tells her again that they trained her well, calling her a little bird.\nShe is led to the lower bailey where a crowd is gathered. She can hear Lord \nGyles Rosby\n coughing as they part to let\nher pass. Ser \nHoras Redwyne\n and \nHobber Redwyne\n avoid her gaze as she passes. There is a cat shot by a bolt\nmewling on the ground. Ser Dontos, riding a broomstick as commanded by the king, whispers to her to “Be brave.”\nIn the center stands Joffrey with Ser \nBoros Blount\n and Ser \nMeryn Trant\n beside him. She kneels before him, but\nJoffrey snaps that kneeling will not save her and she must answer for her brother’s treasons. She is slow to get up,\nand the Hound, not ungently, pulls her up when commanded.\nSer \nLancel Lannister\n now speaks to her, claiming that Robb fell upon Ser \nStafford Lannister\n with an army of \nwargs\nnear \nLannisport\n, using some \nsorcery\n. Thousands of men were butchered as they slept. According to Lancel, the\nnorthmen\n feasted on their flesh after the slaughter.\nJoffrey asks if she has anything to say. Ser Dontos tells him that she is shocked witless. Joffrey then brings up that\nher \ndirewolf\n savaged him, and Sansa retorts that it was \nArya\n's wolf (\nNymeria\n), and that he killed \nLady\n even though\nshe never hurt him. Joffrey replies that it was \nEddard Stark\n that killed Lady, and he killed him. Joffrey then recounts\nhow he shot a man in the throat at the gates that was bigger than her father. He would shoot her also but \nCersei\n says\nthey will kill \nJaime\n. He then commands the Hound to hit Sansa, but Ser Dontos intervenes by wacking her over the\nhead with his morning star—a melon on the end of a stick. People are laughing, but, despite Sansa’s prayers, Joffrey\ndoes not. Instead he calls to his \nKingsguard\n, telling them to save her face. Ser \nMeryn Trant\n flings Dontos down\nwhile Ser Boros first slams a fist into Sansa’s belly, and then starts to lay the flat of his blade across her thighs. The\nHound rasps “Enough,” but the king orders Boros to make her naked and he tears the silk of her bodice away\nexposing her breasts. She can hear sniggers as Joffery orders her beat bloody.\nAt that point, a voice demands \n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n. Sansa looks to see the arrival of a furious \nTyrion\nLannister\n, flanked by \nhis sellsword\n and \none of his tribesmen\n who demands Blount tell him what sort of \nknight\n beats\nhelpless maids. Ser Boros replies one that serves his king, drawing his sword, with Ser Meryn stepping beside him.\nBronn warns them to be careful, as they don’t want to get blood all over their white cloaks. Tryion asks for someone\nto give Sansa something to cover herself with, and Sandor tosses her his cloak. Tyrion then asks Joffrey whether he\nhas no regard for her honor, considering that she is to be his queen one day. Joffrey replies that he is punishing her\nfor having the blood of the wolf, and Tyrion replies that Joffrey has the wits of a goose. Joffrey insists that the king\ncan do as he likes, and Tyrion asks if he knows what happened to \nAerys II Targaryen\n, who also did what he liked.\n\nSer Boros warns Tyrion that no one is to threaten the king, but Tyrion responds he is only educating him, and then\ntells Bronn and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d9b91d7de5239d610dec51c1fdf68ddcd6676f88e9a1db1ab8fb7b7941f64416_v2"}
