He knows that Ramsay has been forced to restrain his violent outbursts in \nBarrowton\n as he needs\nthe loyalty of the \nDustins\n and \nRyswells\n, but what he does behind closed doors is none of their concern. Ramsay then\nthrows a severed head for Theon to catch, which he cannot because of his maimed hands. He does not recognize the\nhead as it is covered in blood, rotting, and bursting with maggots.\nTheon is then ordered to put away the men's horses. He is followed by \nBig Walder Frey\n, who, Theon notes, does not\ntake after his older cousin in the malicious ways of the flayed men. Theon asks Big Walder who the man's head\nbelonged to, and he replies it was just an old man who called Ramsay \"Lord Snow.\"\nThen there is a feast, and Theon is chained to the wall and waits his turn to eat, though the dogs provide the night's\nentertainment fighting each other for scraps. Theon remembers when Ramsay told him that \nall the dogs\n are named\nafter peasant girls he hunted, raped, flayed, and killed. He notes the next litter will likely include a \nKyra\n. It is then\nthat \nRoose Bolton\n enters the hall with some of his men. Here it is discovered what happened to the Frey men and\nwhy they were searching. The Freys rode ahead of the procession of the \nManderlys\n. Wyman Manderly stopped\nfrequently to feast, but the Freys rode on and disappeared. Roose says that \nHosteen Frey\n and \nAenys Frey\n are\ndistressed, but Ramsay says it is of no concern, as there are plenty of Frey men at \nthe Twins\n.\nRamsay and Roose argue; Roose says that his son is acting brash and foolish and drawing attention to himself with\nhis cruel and barbaric amusements, that his fore-bears were no fools. He notes that they have powerful allies in the\nFreys and the \nLannisters\n, but the northmen despise them and only accept \nHouse Bolton\n's authority grudgingly (with\nonly the exception of Lady \nBarbrey Dustin\n, whose support Ramsay would cast aside because she hates him; Roose\npoints out that Lady Dustin was fond of his late son, \nDomeric Bolton\n, and holds Ramsay responsible for his death).\nThey talk briefly about the dead sons of the \nStarks\n, and what might happen if they were to \"return\" from the dead;\nRoose angrily chides his son for openly discussing his part in the \nSack of Winterfell\n, pointing out that their northern\nvassals would turn on them in an instant if they learned the truth. Roose then changes the subject by informing\nRamsay that \nStannis\n has marched from the Wall, adding that it is not towards the intended trap at the \nDreadfort\n that\nthe \nKarstarks\n baited, thus revealing that the Karstarks are double-crossing Stannis.\nRoose tells Ramsay he is to wed \nthe fake Arya Stark\n not in Barrowton, but in \nWinterfell\n. By doing so, the clansmen\nwho follow Stannis will be incensed to march on the keep, something they would not do while the Boltons are in\nBarrowton; once Stannis lays siege to Winterfell, Arnolf will turn on him there. Roose then takes Theon away from\nRamsay. Ramsay tells Theon to observe everything and report back to him, but he is to say nothing about his\ntreatment to Roose.\nAs they ride to \nBarrow Hall\n, Roose tells Theon he knows what his bastard son has asked of him. He goes on to say\nthat he knows what the real \nReek\n was like, the opposite of what Ramsay has turned Theon into. He notes that he\nprovided the first Reek as a servant to the unruly young Ramsay; he had intended it to be a cruel joke, but is now\nuncertain whether Reek corrupted Ramsay or the other way around. Ramsay was the child of a rape, one that Roose\n\nis not proud of; he chanced upon the beautiful young wife of an old miller while out hunting and decided to practice\nthe illicit tradition of the \nfirst night\n, having the miller hanged and then taking the man's wife. The woman showed up\nat the Dreadfort a year later with baby Ramsay; Roose had intended to have the woman whipped and the infant\nthrown down a well, but when he saw the child had his eyes, Roose stayed his hand and agreed to aid them- he gave\nthe woman back the farm her husband's brother had stolen from her, had the man's tongue cut out to stop him telling\ntales to \nRickard Stark\n, Roose's liege, and periodically sent the woman a few pigs, chickens and coin to help bring up\nthe bastard child on the condition she never tell the boy who his father was. He thinks that the woman may have had\na hand in turning Ramsay on to desiring goals outside the rights of a bastard\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
