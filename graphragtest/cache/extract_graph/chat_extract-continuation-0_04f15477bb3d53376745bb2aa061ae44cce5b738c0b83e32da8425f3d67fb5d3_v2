Hundreds of people are dying in\nthe water. \nKing Joffrey\n complains that most of his ships are ablaze, but for Tyrion there is no alternative to\nsacrificing them. Some of Stannis' ships have escaped, however, releasing men in front of the city wall or waiting on\nthe southern shore of the Blackwater. Tyrion allows Joffrey to launch the \nAntler Men\n with the \ncatapults\n into the\nfray. He gets word that there is a large force attempting to batter down the \nKing's Gate\n. When he arrives there, he\norders \nthe Hound\n, who is in command, to go out with his men, but Clegane refuses. Tyrion realizes that the man is\nafraid of the wildfire and he is forced to rally the troops himself, leading a sortie through the gate to stop Stannis'\nmen.\nSynopsis\nTyrion Lannister\n, standing on top of the \nMud Gate\n, watches motionlessly as half of \nStannis'\n fleet is ablaze in the\nBlackwater Rush\n, along with most of \nKing Joffrey's\n ships. It seems like the river itself is on fire. The air is full of\nsmoke, arrows and screams. The wildfire is drifting downstream towards ships that desperately, but futilely, try to\nescape. The low-hanging clouds reflect the green glow, creating an eerily beautiful scenery. Tyrion is reminded of\ndragon fire and wonders whether he feels the same way as \nAegon the Conqueror\n did when he watched the \nField of\nFire\n. He is captivated and can't turn away, although he realizes that this is only half a victory and that the\ncelebrations of the \nGold Cloaks\n behind him are premature.\nTyrion sees another ship loaded with wildfire exploding and has to shield his eyes. Hundreds of people are dying in\nthe water, either burning to death or drowning. He thinks of Stannis, who might be sitting on his warhorse among\nthe mass of people on the southern bank of the Blackwater, watching the same spectacle. Tyrion hears King Joffrey,\nhuddled among his guards on the wallwalk below, complaining about the fate of his fleet, as the \nKingslander\n, \nQueen\nCersei\n and \nLoyal Man\n are already burning and the \nSeaflower\n is about to be engulfed by flames as well. He advises\nhis nephew that there was no alternative to sacrificing the own fleet, thinking by himself that Stannis would have\nsensed the trap, if the royal fleet had not come forward for battle. \nBronn\n's position under the \nRed Keep\n is too far\naway for Tyrion to see anything, but the sellsword must have set the oxen into motion the second Stannis' flagship\nhad passed and the enormously heavy chain was pulled up by the winches, creating a barrier that now prevents most\nships from escaping the wildfire inferno.\nSome do, though, as Tyrion observes with dismay. While the main channel of the Blackwater is all aflame, the north\nand south banks are not, as the wildfire has not spread as evenly Tyrion hoped it would. A good part of Stannis'\nships have made for the southern side of the Blackwater, from where they can bring the enemy troops across later\non, while at least eight ships have already landed under the city wall, putting men ashore there. Stannis' main host\nmight need some time to regain their courage after watching the jade holocaust that has absorbed so many of their\nfellows, but when they start to attack again, the risk of the city forces breaking will be acute, as Lord \nJacelyn\nBywater\n has warned Tyrion. Seeing shapes moving among the charred ruins of the city wharves, he sends order to\nLord Jacelyn to make another sortie against soldiers stumbling ashore.\nHe also commands Ser \nArneld\n to swing the \nThree Whores\n thirty degrees west. King Joffrey brings up that his\nmother has promised him that he could use the catapults and Tyrion allows him to go through with his plan for the\nAntler Men\n. When they were brought before the King for justice, Joffrey promised them that he would send them\n\nback to Stannis. The traitors are now naked and trussed up in the square, antlers nailed to their heads, and Joffrey\nintends to catapult the bodies over the city wall in Stannis' direction. Tyrion tells Joffrey to proceed swiftly, as the\nGreat Whores will be needed for other things soon. As the happy King is about to leave, escorted by members of the\nKingsguard\n, Tyrion orders Ser \nOsmund Kettleblack\n that they should keep Joffrey safe under any circumstance but\nalso keep him among the defenders. He wonders whether \nCersei\n will be true to her promise of protecting \nAlayaya\nthe way he protects Cersei's wretched bastard son.\nTyrion gets word that hundreds of enemies have landed on the tourney grounds and prepare for battering down the\nKing's Gate\n with a ram\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYRION
