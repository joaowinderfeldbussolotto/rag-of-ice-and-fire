He considers\nthe possibility that the \npoisoned locusts\n that \nStrong Belwas\n ate might have been meant for Hizdhar, as part of a plot\nto direct Daenerys into marrying Quentyn, given that \nanother of the prince's uncles\n was notorious for poisoning\nthose who got in his way.\nBefore he makes up his mind on the matter, three \nWise Masters\n envoys from \nYunkai\n arrive, along with their\nsellsword \nBloodbeard\n, to talk with Hizdahr.
