If they remain where\nthey are they might get caught between three armies. Tywin explains that he plans to go to \nHarrenhal\n to confront\nRobb Stark. Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n will screen their movements, while \nGregor Clegane\n, \nVargo Hoat\n, and Ser \nAmory\nLorch\n with 300 men each will set fire to the \nriverlands\n south of the Red Fork.\nOnce Ser Kevan leaves to issue the orders, Lord Tywin offers to let Tyrion’s \nclansmen\n ride with Vargo Hoat, but\nTyrion wishes to keep them close. Lord Tywin insists that Tyrion must learn to control them then, because he will\nnot have King’s Landing pillaged. Tyrion does not understand until his father explains that he is sending him to\ncourt to act as \nHand of the King\n and clean up the mess Cersei and the \nsmall council\n have created. Lord Tywin goes\non to rant about the raising of \nJanos Slynt\n, the dishonoring of Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n--who lent honor to any man he\nserved--and the appointment of \nthe Hound\n to the \nKingsguard\n. He also tasks Tyrion with bringing Joffrey under\ncontrol if Cersei continues to fail and gives instructions to execute any councilors who play Tyrion false. When\nTyrion asks why ‘‘he’’ is being sent, Tywin states it is because Tyrion is his son; Tyrion, however, thinks it is\nbecause Tywin has given up Jaime for lost. As he leaves, Tywin commands that Tyrion is not to take \nhis whore\n to\ncourt.\nTyrion sits for a long while in the common room before going to his bed with Shae and whispering that he is of a\nmind to take her to King’s Landing.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VIII\n↑\nDaenerys IX\n ←\nTyrion IX\n→ \nJon IX\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nTyrion I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 70: Jon IX\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n- \nMole's Town\n and areas to the south of it\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon VIII\n↑\nTyrion IX\n ←\nJon IX\n→ \nCatelyn XI\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nJon I\nJon\n deserts in the middle of the night, determined to join his brother \nRobb\n in the quest for vengeance. South of\nMole's Town\n, his friends catch up and bring him back. In the morning, \nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n reveals he knows\nabout the night’s events and convinces Jon to stay and join him on a \ngreat ranging\n \nbeyond the Wall\n.\nSynopsis\nLate at night, \nJon\n saddles a mare in the stables of \nCastle Black\n. As he mounts up, \nSam\n appears in the doorway,\ninsisting that Jon cannot do this. Jon warns Sam to get out of his way since he does not want to hurt him. When the\nfat boy refuses, Jon spurs his horse and forces Sam to leap out of the way, stumbling and falling. The mare leaps\nover Sam. As he heads south down the \nkingsroad\n, Jon hopes that Sam has not hurt himself getting out of the way.\nThe whole castle is silent and there is no one to see him leave; all the sentries are atop \nthe Wall\n, looking north. Jon\ntrusts that Sam loves him enough to give him a head start. In truth, he does not believe the timid boy can summon\nthe courage to disturb the guards to wake the \nLord Commander\n in the night. As he rides, Jon flexes his burnt hand,\nappreciating having the bandages off.\nJon stays on the kingsroad in the moonlight, knowing that he must get as far from Castle Black as he can before\ndawn, planning to then go overland to confuse the pursuit. When he fails to bring the Lord Commander’s breakfast\nat dawn they will search his cell, discover \nLongclaw\n, and know he has deserted. It was hard to leave the sword, but\nin the end Jon followed \nJorah Mormont\n’s example. The thought of betraying old \nJeor Mormont\n’s trust bothers Jon,\nbut it cannot be helped. Jon is still not sure he is doing the honorable thing. Jon thinks that the southerners have it\neasier; they can talk to their \nseptons\n to help sort out right from wrong whereas the \nheart trees\n do not talk.\nOnce out of sight of Castle Black, Jon slows his pace to spare the horse. He hopes to trade her for a new one and\ncannot do that if she is injured or blown. He will also require an entire set of new clothes; his black wool, leather,\nand steel will draw the suspicions of everyone north of \nthe Neck\n. Once Maester \nAemon\n's ravens take flight, not even\nWinterfell\n will offer refuge to him.\nYet fond memories of Winterfell are not why Jon has forsaken his vows. He is \nhis father\n’s son and \nRobb\n's brother.\nMaester \nAemon\n was right about the pain of choosing, but \nTyrion Lannister\n was also right about denying a hard\ntruth. Jon is done with denying the truth. For the rest of his life, he will be accursed and outcast but it will be worth\nit so long as he lives long\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f616859eedadf657c4a2b985e6b18c03a8e479ea683731fda280c11f1e8a1196_v2"}
