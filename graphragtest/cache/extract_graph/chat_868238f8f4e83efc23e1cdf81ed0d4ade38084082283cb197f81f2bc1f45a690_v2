She had no\nsuch luck, but concluded that the \nFree Cities\n would be a good place to land, considering that \nSyrio Forel\n came from\nBraavos and possibly \nJaqen H'ghar\n as well.\nDuring the voyage, many of the sailors and even the captain have tried to get her to learn and remember their names,\nand many seem afraid of her. The captain's younger son \nDenyo\n is telling Arya some of the history of Braavos and\nthe Titan that guards its port. The free city honors all gods and even has temples devoted to them, and was founded\nby the \nMoonsingers\n when they brought the people to Braavos to escape the dragons of \nValyria\n. The \nTitan of\nBraavos\n is a massive statue, and has arrow slits and murder holes strategically placed to attack any boat that tries to\npass beneath without leave. Furthermore, the Free City of Braavos is protected by the \nArsenal\n, a massive fleet of\nships and their fortified port.\nThe captain has his older son \nYorko\n row Arya to shore, so as to get her off prior to customs coming aboard. As\nYorko navigates the hundred isles of Braavos, he points out many of the sites, before dropping her off at the quay in\nfront of the \nHouse of Black and White\n. Arya disembarks, assuring Yorko that she will remember his name, and\nenters the temple of the \nMany-Faced God\n. Within, the temple is quite dark with dozens of odd statues, and Arya\nnotices several people in alcoves who are either dead or dying. Soon, a robed man with a kind voice tells her that the\nHouse of Black and White is a place of peace. He asks her name, but despite Arya's use of nicknames, the man\nkeeps asking until she admits that she is Arya Stark. When the man asks if she fears death, Arya answers no. The\nman removes his cowl to reveal a decaying, horrible visage, but she sees through the illusion. Impressed, the \nkindly\nman\n asks if she is hungry, to which Arya thinks: \nYes, but not for food.\nNavigation:\nArya XIII\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nSamwell I\n ←\nArya I\n→ \nCersei II\n↓\nArya II\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 7: Cersei II\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei I\n↑\nArya I\n ←\nCersei II\n→ \nJaime I\n↓\nCersei III\nSynopsis\nCersei arrives at the \nGreat Sept of Baelor\n for \nTywin\n's wake.
