Jon knows that doing so\nwill break his vow to not interfere in the wars of the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, so he is prepared to go alone. He asks if\nanyone will ride with him and he gets an overwhelming roar of support from most of the wildlings, though not from\nhis Black Brothers - \nYarwyck\n and \nBowen Marsh\n leave the hall with their men. Jon doesn't mind as he appears to\nhave more than enough men to go with him and none of the Night's Watch will have to break their vows.\nWhen Jon is on his way to inform Queen Selyse, he hears the giant \nWun Wun\n roar and a man scream. When he\narrives, a bleeding Wun Wun is smashing dead \nSer Patrek\n against a tower wall. Jon tries to calm the people who\ncome running, when \nWick Wittlestick\n slashes at Jon's throat with a dagger, just barely grazing him. While Jon is still\ntrying to understand, Bowen Marsh and others plant daggers in him, all of them saying, \n\"For the Watch.\"\n By the\ntime the fourth dagger slashes him, Jon passes out.\nNavigation:\nJon XII\n↑\nThe Dragontamer\n ←\nJon XIII\n→ \nThe Queen's Hand\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 70: The Queen's\nHand\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Kingbreaker\n↑\nJon XIII\n ←\nThe Queen's Hand\n→ \nDaenerys X\nSynopsis\nIt is raining heavily in Meereen, for which \nBarristan Selmy\n is grateful; otherwise the fires caused during \nViserion\nand \nRhaegal\n's rampage might have consumed the entire city. There is no sign of the two \ndragons\n: they do not like\nthe rain any more than men. \nQuentyn Martell\n is dead; it took three days for him to die. Out of respect for the prince,\nSer Barristan had him placed in \nthe queen's\n bed, the same one he crossed half the world to reach. \nMissandei\n is the\nonly one he could get to help tend Quentyn, for none of the cupbearers were willing and the \nBlue Graces\n never\nresponded to his summons; he suspects the \npale mare\n has carried them off. Missandei asks what is to be done with\nQuentyn's body and Barristan replies that they will find a way to send him back to \nDorne\n, though he is unsure how.\nHe advises Missandei to get some sleep and she urges him to do the same as she has noted that he doesn't sleep very\nmuch. Barristan privately thinks it is not just needing less sleep than a younger man, as \nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n once\ntold him, but having reached the age where he fears to close his eyes in case he never opens them again; Barristan\ndoes not consider dying in his sleep a death worthy of a knight of the \nKingsguard\n. For a brief moment, he wonders if\nDaenerys is dead, but then dismisses the thought, though he notes that each time it becomes harder to convince\nhimself his queen is still alive.\nAt dawn, \nSkahaz mo Kandaq\n comes to speak with him; Skahaz is already aware that Quentyn is dead, and he\ninforms Barristan that the \nGreen Grace\n, who Barristan sent to treat with the \nYunkai'i\n to make them release the\nhostages, has not returned to the city. In addition, while the city is secure, an angry mob is gathered outside the\npyramid demanding \nHizdahr\n's release and that both dragons be destroyed, and since his arrest, the \nSons of the Harpy\nhave resumed their nightly murders with a vengeance; Barristan is shocked to learn they have killed twenty nine in\nthe night, in contrast to nine the previous night and three the night before. However, despite Skahaz's insistence,\nBarristan still refuses to kill the hostages in retaliation.\nThe Shavepate tells Barristan (who is now the Queen's \nHand\n, as head of a council ruling the city) that the council is\nwaiting for him. Barristan does not want the position, but in the absence of Daenerys, he doesn't trust any of the\nothers to rule. \nGrey Worm\n and the captains of the \nStalwart Shields\n, \nMother's Men\n and \nFree Brothers\n, along with\nStrong Belwas\n are present. Barristan informs them of Quentyn's death; most of the council express contempt for the\nprince's actions and many want his companions, who are at present imprisoned, executed for unleashing the dragons\non the city. The fighting pits are to remain closed, for fear that the noise and smell of blood will attract the dragons,\nthough \nMarselen\n suggests reopening the pits in the hope it lures \nDrogon\n back, and Daenerys with him. For the time\nbeing, the pits are packed full of livestock, from which the dragons are feeding regularly, and thus far, there has\nbeen no further evidence of either Viserion or Rhaegal eating people.\nThe council are convinced that the Yunkai'i are never going to accept any terms beside the killing of both dragons\nfor the return of the hostages.
