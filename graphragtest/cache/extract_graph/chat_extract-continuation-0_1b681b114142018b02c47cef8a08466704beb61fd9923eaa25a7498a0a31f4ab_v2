The maester states that it will work and he should\nhave thought of it himself. Tyrion responds that the idea came easier to him, since the design is similar to his own\nsaddle. Robb is suspicious of Tyrion’s motive, to which Tyrion replies that Jon asked it of him, and he has a weak\nspot for cripples, bastards, and broken things.\nRickon comes in from outside with the three direwolves, who immediately start growling and surround Tyrion.\nTheon\n comments that the wolves do not like Tyrion’s smell. Tyrion says that it is time he took his leave, but the\nwolves assault him before he can move more than a step. They are called off in time by the boys. Tyrion finds the\nhostility of the wolves to be interesting, and states nothing is harmed save his dignity. Even Robb is shaken and says\nhe does not know why the wolves attacked. Before Tyrion can leave, Maester Luwin confers with Robb, who then\noffers the hospitality of Winterfell to Tyrion. Tyrion declines the invitation as a false courtesy, declaring that he will\nstay in the inn he saw outside the wall.\nRobb then tells the Night’s Watch men they have rooms prepared, and invites them for dinner. Bran is looking\nforward to feasting that night with the Night’s Watch. In his room, Bran expresses his excitement at being able to\nride again to Summer. Bran dreams of climbing, and sees the shapes of twisted and grotesque gargoyles, and then he\nhears them whispering. The gargoyles pull themselves free and climb towards Bran. Bran starts to scream, shouting\nthat he did not hear. He wakes to find Hodor above him. Hodor cleans and dresses him and carries him down to the\nGreat Hall.\nThat evening, Robb and Bran host the Night’s Watch men for dinner. The black brothers bring the dire tidings of\nBenjen Stark\n. \nYoren\n states that Benjen is probably dead, but Robb vehemently disagrees. One of the brothers\nassures them that Benjen knows the haunted forest better than anyone, and will find his way back. Bran thinks of\nOld Nan’s stories and blurts out that uncle Benjen will be saved by the children of the forest. Maester Luwin tells\nhim the children have been dead for thousands of years, but Yoren disagrees, wondering who’s to say what lives\nbeyond the Wall?\nThat night Robb carries Bran up to his bed himself. Robb sits by Bran for a long time, and tells him that they will\nfind a horse for him. Bran asks if the others will be coming back. Robb says yes with much hope in his voice. Robb\nthen tells Bran that he can meet his mother riding his new horse and later they can visit the Wall together.\nNavigation:\nBran III\n↑\nDaenerys III\n ←\nBran IV\n→ \nEddard V\n↓\nBran V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 25: Eddard V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard IV\n↑\nBran IV\n ←\nEddard V\n→ \nJon IV\n↓\nEddard VI\nNed\n speaks with \nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n about Lord \nJon Arryn\n’s final days. On his way back, he finds \nArya\n training\nto be a \nwater dancer\n on the steps of the \nTower of the Hand\n. Later, he is visited by \nLittlefinger\n who has found four of\nLord Arryn’s household remaining in \nKing's Landing\n.\nSynopsis\nNed\n meets with Grand \nMaester\n \nPycelle\n in the stifling heat that has covered the city. Pycelle talks about how the\nsmallfolk claim that the last year of summer is the hottest. The Grand Maester goes on to say that he does not\nbelieve this, noting that the King Maekar’s Summer was even hotter and broke in the seventh year, leading to a short\nautumn and a terrible long winter. Then Pycelle digresses about being a young man, forging his maester’s chain\nduring the reign of King \nMaekar I\n.\nFinally, Pycelle remembers that Ned asked about \nJon Arryn\n and explains that Lord Arryn was melancholy but\nhealthy, then suddenly became ill. He had asked Pycelle about a \nbook\n, and Pycelle remembers noting that something\nwas troubling him. The next day, Lord Arryn was twisted over in pain, unable to get out of bed. Ned mentions that\nhe has heard that Pycelle sent away Lord Arryn’s maester. Pycelle states that this was because he felt Maester\nColemon\n didn’t understand the older body and was endangering Lord Arryn's life with purging potions.\nNed asks if Lord Arryn had any final words. Pycelle responds that Jon Arryn called out the name “Robert” several\ntimes, but does not know if he was talking about \nthe king\n or \nhis son\n. His last words were whispered to \nLysa Arryn\nand King Robert: \"The seed is strong.\"\nNext, Ned asks if there was anything unnatural about the death, and follows up by asking if Pycelle had seen\nanything like this illness before. Pycelle states that he has seen more of illness than he would like to remember and\nthat every illness is different and yet alike. Eventually, Pycelle says that Jon Arryn’s death was no stranger than any\nother.
