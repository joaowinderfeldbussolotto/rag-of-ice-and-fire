There, the Shavepate says that the \nSons of the Harpy\n \npoisoned the\nlocusts\n that Belwas ate, intending to kill Dany, that \nVolantis\n has dispatched its fleet, and that Hizdahr means to open\nMeereen's gates for them.\nSkahaz asks him to speak to \nGrey Worm\n, as he will trust Barristan and support them. Selmy agrees to conspire with\nthe Shavepate against Hizdahr, and to attack the unsuspecting Yunkai'i before the fleet from Volantis can arrive to\ntake the city and enslave all Dany's people. He does this on the condition that Hizdahr's guilt can be proven and\nBarristan thinks to himself that he will kill the man personally.
