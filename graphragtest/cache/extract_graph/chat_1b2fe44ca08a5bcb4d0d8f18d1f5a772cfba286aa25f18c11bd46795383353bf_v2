However, the sellswords and slaves from Yunkai and its allies\nare still besieging Meereen. Just as in Meereen, the \nbloody flux\n has been affecting the Yunkish troops as well.\nDaenerys is upset that the Yunkai'i are holding a slave market just outside the city, but \nHizdahr\n tells her it is only for\na time and to let them have their show and they will have their peace, with Yunkai keeping their slave trade and\nMeereen remaining out of it.\nThe Yunkai'i have brought representatives of the four sellsword companies serving them: the \nTattered Prince\n for the\nWindblown\n, \nGylo Rhegan\n for the \nLong Lances\n, \nBloodbeard\n for the \nCompany of the Cat\n and \nBrown Ben Plumm\n for\nthe \nSecond Sons\n. Daenerys is relieved by \nDaario\n's absence, since she knows that he would be furious with Plumm.\nAn exchange of seven hostages has been arranged in order to ensure a measure of peace during the cerimonies. The\nfour sellsword captains and the three Yunkish nobles present \nYurkhaz zo Yunzak\n, Supreme Commander, and two\nothers) are understood to be Daenerys' hostages for the time being, while Daenerys offers seven of her own to the\nYunkish siege camp in exchange (Hizdar's sister, two of his cousins, her bloodrider \nJhogo\n, her admiral \nGroleo\n, her\nUnsullied\n captain \nHero\n and Daario Naharis).\nSkahaz mo Kandaq\n the Shavepate is absent as well, having been replaced as commander of the \nBrazen Beasts\n by\nHizdahr zo Loraq's cousin, \nMarghaz zo Loraq\n.\nWere he not a hostage, Daario might be causing trouble. He is unhappy about Dany's wedding to Hizdahr, and he\ngot furious when \nQuentyn Martell\n revealed that his group of \nWesterosi\n Windblowns had been ordered to \"defect\" to\nMeereen. Daario nearly slew them all in his rage, but \nGrey Worm\n intervened and stopped him, choosing instead to\nimprison the group of Windblowns.\nBrown Ben comes up to her and explains his defection, saying that it is natural for sellswords to change sides if they\nbelieve that it will improve their odds of survival. He claims that the Second Sons were troubled when they learned\nthat Daenerys could not use her dragons to help fight the Yunkish forces. After he leaves, she asks Ser \nBarristan\nSelmy\n his opinion, as he was hiding and listening as always. He advises her that Brown Plumm is quite truthful, and\nconfirms that it is not wise to place trust in a sellsword.\nSeeking ways to make up for the loss of the Second Sons, Dany asks Ser Barristan about the possibility of finding a\nrival leader in the group that might want to \"remove\" Brown Ben Plumm. Barristan thinks it possible, but doesn't\nknow for certain. She then mentions the other three mercenary companies, prompting Barristan to offer to arrange a\nmeeting with Gylo Rhegan or the Tattered Prince if she wants so. Dany says that this is not the time or the place as\nthere are too many watchful eyes about. Barristan admits that he is not the best man for such work, and that back in\nWesteros, it would have been \nLittlefinger\n or \nthe Spider\n to have done this kind of work.\nDany's mind turns back to the captured Westerosi turncloaks. She realizes that by freeing one of the Windblows she\n\nmight establish negotiations with their leader, the Tattered Prince, and perhaps sway them to her cause. She first\nsuggests and later commands Ser Barristan to send back the woman \nMeris\n as a gesture of her regard, knowing that\ntheir captain will get the message. She wants to contact the Long Lances and the Company of the Cat as well.\nBarristan advises against dealing with Bloodbeard of the Company of the Cat, however; he says that he reminds him\nof the \nNinepenny Kings\n, that he is much too greedy and much too dishonourable to be an asset. Daenerys feels that\nsuch men might be the easiest to sway, but decides to trust his counsel on this matter.\nShe then summons Quentyn to speak further, at Ser Barristan's suggestion. He still believes that the Dornish envoys\nare their best option for returning to Westeros, though Dany will not abandon her city. She speaks with him and\nbrings him to the dragon pit\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1b2fe44ca08a5bcb4d0d8f18d1f5a772cfba286aa25f18c11bd46795383353bf_v2"}
