Qhorin recognizes Jon, and tells him that he knew Lord \nEddard\n and Jon’s grandfather Lord\nRickard\n as well. The men from the Shadow Tower were delayed because they met \nAlfyn Crowkiller\n and his men\nwho had been scouting along \nthe Wall\n. They killed the wildling leader and took some captives, but lost four men in\nthe process. Later, Jon overhears dissent in the ranks as \nChett\n and \nLark\n the Sisterman speak of not going into the\nFrostfangs\n, no matter what the \nOld Bear\n orders. Jon has given the warhorn he found to \nSam\n, because it is cracked\nand he could get no sound from it, but Sam likes ancient items.\nIn Mormont's tent, Jon overhears Qhorin telling Mormont about a captive claiming that \nMance Rayder\n had \nwargs\nand \nmammoths\n in his army. He also explains that the captive claims the wildlings plan to breach the Wall, not climb\nit or burrow beneath it. Qhorin tells them that Mance is seeking something in the high, cold places of the Frostfangs,\nsome power or artifact. Qhorin advises the Old Bear to send scouts into the mountains, and Mormont agrees. \nJarmen\nBuckwell\n will take four men to climb the \nGiant's Stair\n, \nThoren Smallwood\n will lead a party to probe the \nMilkwater\n,\nwhile Qhorin himself will lead a third party into the \nSkirling Pass\n. Qhorin immediately chooses Jon Snow as one of\nhis four men, stating, \"The \nold gods\n are still strong \nbeyond the Wall\n.

He\nis disturbed that \nVarys\n has not learned of this, or decided not to inform him.\nLater, Tyrion has \nBronn\n deliver word to Ser \nJacelyn Bywater\n, commanding him to take fifty men and capture Lord\nGyles' party, and to expel the garrison and keep Tommen safe at Rosby. He does not want Lord Rosby hurt, nor any\nkilling done in front of Tommen. For this, Ser Jacelyn will earn a lordship. Bronn offers to do the job instead if\nthere's a lordship in it for him, but Tyrion refuses, privately noting that Bywater's men will defend Tommen whereas\nBronn's are more likely to sell Tommen to the crown's enemies if the coming battle goes against them.\nTyrion then sets out for \nChataya\n’s, but then abandons his patience and rides directly to \nShae\n’s mansion. He finds her\nlistening to \na singer\n, and has the man expelled and sworn to silence. When one of the \nbegging brothers\n appears, Shae\nrecognizes him as Lord Varys. The Spider informs Tyrion that \nStorm's End\n has fallen and that \nStannis\n will soon be\nmarching on \nKing's Landing\n. Tyrion bids Varys to wait at the stables while he talks to Shae.\nOnce alone, Shae asks Tyrion to make her his lady in court, and even suggests he kill Cersei, but Tyrion tells her,\n\"The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men.\"\n When Tyrion proposes to take her\nto the \nRed Keep\n and hide her in the kitchens, Shae balks, and mocks him for being afraid of \nhis father\n. Tyrion slaps\nher in the face, telling her never to mock him again. Feeling remorseful, he tells her the story of \nTysha\n and his\nfather’s wrath. He departs to meet Varys at the stables, and the eunuch suggests that Shae be placed as a maidservant\nto Lady \nTanda\n’s daughter \nLollys\n. Shae would then be able to access the \nTower of the Hand\n through a secret passage,\nwhich Tyrion is surprised to learn exists.\nVarys then attempts to tell Tyrion how Ser \nCortnay\n died, and when he suggests it was magic, Tyrion disbelieves\nhim.
