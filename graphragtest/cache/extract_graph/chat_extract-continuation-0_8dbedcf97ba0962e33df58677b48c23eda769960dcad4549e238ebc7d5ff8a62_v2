Shireen asks to see the white raven, and the maester will not deny her since she has been denied too\nmuch during her life of almost ten years. She is the saddest child the maester has ever known and he considers her\nanother mark of his failures.\nWhile Pylos goes to fetch the white raven, Cressen thinks how the solemn 25-year-old Pylos is not a good match for\nDragonstone because grim places need lightening. However, a maester does not choose his post, and Cressen recalls\ncoming to Dragonstone himself 12 years ago with his lord, though he never liked it here and never considered it\nhome. Of late, when he wakes from restless nightmares of the \nred woman\n, Cressen often does not know where he is.\nCressen asks Shireen why she is up so early. The girl explains that she had nightmares of dragons coming to eat her.\nThe maester remembers that she has always had nightmares. Thinking of the many dragon-inspired statues and\nbuildings of Dragonstone, Cressen attempts to comfort her by explaining that Dragonstone was once the\nwesternmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of \nValyria\n. The dragon towers were created to make the fortress seem\nmore formidable. He explains that the Valryians had long-forgotten ways of shaping stone and used them to make\nthe thousands of stone dragons on the island. Shireen is unconvinced, telling him that the red woman says the thing\nin the sky is dragon’s breath. Cressen explains that it is only a comet and will be gone soon.\nShireen states that her mother says the white raven means it is not summer any more, and the maester confirms that\nit is true. He then goes on to tell her about the white ravens, and how the Citadel has determined that summer is\nover. Cressen says that it is hoped that there will be a warm autumn with bountiful harvests. He knows that a long\nsummer is said to bring a long winter, but does not want to frighten the child. When she asks if it will snow, the\nmaester says it will, but he prays it will not be for years yet. Then, Pylos returns with the white raven, and the\nmaester introduces the raven to Shireen. Shireen is delighted to learn that it can speak.\nPatchface begins to sing, “The shadows came to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,” hopping from one\nfoot to the other, “The shadows came to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.” He jerks his head with each\nword, and his bells make a clangor. Shireen declares that Patchface has been singing that song often lately and it\n\nscares her. She asks the maester to make him stop. Cressen thinks back to how the old Lord \nSteffon Baratheon\n found\nthe fool in \nVolantis\n while seeking a wife for \nRhaegar Targaryen\n. Upon their return journey, within sight of \nhome\n,\ntheir ship sank, killing everyone aboard. Patchface was washed up on the shore three days later, naked, cold, and\nclammy. They took him for dead, but then he coughed up water and survived, albeit broken in mind and body,\nhardly capable of speech let alone wit. Many suggested that it would be kindest for Cressen to let the mad boy die,\nbut he refused, and now he wonders at that decision. Cressen assures Shireen that Patchface is just rambling and\ndoes not comprehend any of what he says.\nPylos, who went to fetch Cressen’s breakfast, returns to inform him that Ser \nDavos Seaworth\n returned during the\nnight and has been with Stannis most of the night. Cressen complains that he should have been notified, as it is his\nduty to advise the king. Asking pardons of Shireen, the old man has Pylos help him hobble with his bad hips to the\nStone Drum, the main keep of Dragonstone. He passes windows from which he can see 3,000 men in the camp\noutside the wall, and the anchorage filled with ships since no ship that has come within sight of Dragonstone has\nbeen allowed to leave.\nOnce inside the Stone Drum, Cressen leaves Pylos, stating he wants to see Stannis alone. As he ascends the stairs he\nregrets leaving Pylos. He meets Ser Davos coming down the stairs. Davos reveals that his mission as envoy to the\nStormlands\n has been a failure. It is as Cressen warned: the lords sworn to \nStorm's End\n have no love for Stannis and\nwill not support his claim. Instead, they have joined with the lords of the \nReach\n in supporting Stannis’ younger\nbrother, \nRenly\n.\nNews of Renly claiming the crown leads Cressen to worry for the youngest \nBaratheon\n. When Ser Davos mentions\nthat Renly has instituted a \nnew Kingsguard\n, Cressen recalls that Renly was always fond of games and rich bright\nfabrics as a child. “Look at me, I’m a dragon,” and “Look at me, I’m a wizard,” the boy was always shouting.\nCressen sees Renly’s bid to be king as no more than another game: “Look at me, I’m a king!”\nCressen asks Davos if he could bring Stannis any hope, but Davos insists that the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHIREEN<|>PERSON<|>Shireen is a sad child who has nightmares and is curious about the white raven and dragons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER CRESSEN<|>PERSON<|>An old maester who serves at Dragonstone and cares for Shireen, reflecting on his past and failures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYLOS<|>PERSON<|>A solemn 25-year-old maester who assists Cressen and is not fond of Dragonstone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATCHFACE<|>PERSON<|>A broken fool who sings cryptic songs and scares Shireen, saved by Cressen after a shipwreck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEFFON BARATHEON<|>PERSON<|>Former lord who found Patchface in Volantis and died in a shipwreck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHAEGAR TARGARYEN<|>PERSON<|>A figure for whom Steffon Baratheon sought a wife in Volantis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVOS SEAWORTH<|>PERSON<|>A knight who serves Stannis and reports on his failed mission to the Stormlands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STANNIS<|>PERSON<|>A king who is advised by Cressen and faces opposition from his brother Renly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENLY<|>PERSON<|>Stannis' younger brother who claims the crown and forms a new Kingsguard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRAGONSTONE<|>GEO<|>A grim fortress and the westernmost outpost of ancient Valyria, home to stone dragons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALYRIA<|>GEO<|>An ancient Freehold with long-forgotten stone-shaping techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLANTIS<|>GEO<|>A city where Steffon Baratheon found Patchface while seeking a wife for Rhaegar Targaryen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORM'S END<|>GEO<|>A location whose lords do not support Stannis and instead back Renly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE REACH<|>GEO<|>A region whose lords support Renly's claim to the throne)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE STORMLANDS<|>GEO<|>A region where Davos Seaworth failed to gain support for Stannis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CITADEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institution that determines the end of summer using white ravens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW KINGSGUARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group formed by Renly as part of his claim to the throne)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARATHEON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A noble house to which Stannis, Renly, and Steffon belong)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE RAVEN<|>EVENT<|>A sign from the Citadel indicating the end of summer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIPWRECK<|>EVENT<|>The disaster that killed Steffon Baratheon and left Patchface broken)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHIREEN<|>MAESTER CRESSEN<|>Shireen is cared for by Maester Cressen, who tries to comfort her nightmares<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER CRESSEN<|>PYLOS<|>Pylos assists Maester Cressen and fetches the white raven for Shireen<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER CRESSEN<|>PATCHFACE<|>Cressen saved Patchface after the shipwreck and now regrets keeping him alive<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATCHFACE<|>STEFFON BARATHEON<|>Steffon Baratheon found Patchface in Volantis before the shipwreck<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEFFON BARATHEON<|>RHAEGAR TARGARYEN<|>Steffon was seeking a wife for Rhaegar Targaryen in Volantis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER CRESSEN<|>STANNIS<|>Cressen advises Stannis and is upset about not being notified of Davos' return<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVOS SEAWORTH<|>STANNIS<|>Davos serves Stannis and reports on his failed mission to the Stormlands<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STANNIS<|>RENLY<|>Stannis and Renly are brothers competing for the throne, with Renly gaining more support<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENLY<|>NEW KINGSGUARD<|>Renly formed a new Kingsguard as part of his claim to the throne<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRAGONSTONE<|>VALYRIA<|>Dragonstone was the westernmost outpost of ancient Valyria<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STORM'S END<|>THE REACH<|>The lords of Storm's End and the Reach support Renly over Stannis<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHIREEN<|>WHITE RAVEN<|>Shireen is curious about the white raven, which signifies the end of summer<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
