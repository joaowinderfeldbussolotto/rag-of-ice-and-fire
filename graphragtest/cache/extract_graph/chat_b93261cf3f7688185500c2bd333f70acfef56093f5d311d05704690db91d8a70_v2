She and her husband join\nmany other guests at the Queen’s Ballroom to give \nJoffrey\n his wedding gifts. It is a new year, the 300th since\nAegon's Conquest\n, and Joffrey’s wedding is that night. Tyrion presents his nephew with a copy of Grand Maester\nKaeth\n’s \nLives of Four Kings\n, one of only four copies in existence written by Kaeth himself. \nKevan\n tells the King it\nis \"A book every king should read.\" Joffrey is disappointed with the gift, and hacks the book in half with the\nValyrian sword\n his \ngrandfather\n had just given him. Joffrey remarks that he is no stranger to \nValyrian steel\n, and also\nthat Tyrion owes him another gift. Tyrion suggests a Valyrian dagger with a a \ndragonbone\n hilt, which seems to\nunsettle Joffrey for a moment before he says it is a good idea but wants one with a gold hilt instead.\nLater, back in their rooms, Sansa tells Tyrion that she would rather not know how Robb and her mother had\nperished, and Tyrion promises that he will say no more.\nNavigation:\nSansa III\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nSansa IV\n→ \nTyrion VIII\n↓\nSansa V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 60: Tyrion VIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VII\n↑\nSansa IV\n ←\nTyrion VIII\n→ \nSansa V\n↓\nTyrion IX\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n puzzles out how \nhis nephew\n must have found \nLittlefinger\n’s Valyrian dagger amongst \nRobert\n’s possessions,\nassuming that the king had probably forgotten he even owned it. Joffrey must then have paid some unsavory\nfreerider to open \nBran\n’s throat, though Tyrion still cannot figure out why, attributing it to Joffrey's innate cruelty for\nthe moment. Tyrion is slightly drunk while Joffrey and \nMargaery\n are wed in the \nGreat Sept of Baelor\n, and continues\nto drink until night falls and it is time for the great wedding feast. As they enter the ballroom, \nOlenna\n, the Queen of\nThorns, comes over to tell Sansa how beautiful she looks, and the old lady straightens out the hairnet that \nDontos\ngave her. Many at the wedding offer their condolences to Sansa on the loss of \nher mother\n and \nbrother\n; watching his\nwife's courteous and friendly nature to the other guests, Tyrion muses she would have made Joffrey a great queen\nand wife if he'd had the sense to love her, something Tyrion believes his nephew incapable of.\nDuring the feast, Joffrey calls for the royal jousters, and the party is entertained as two dwarfs battle each other.\nJoffrey then mocks his uncle, commanding Tyrion to fight the dwarfs as the king’s champion. Tyrion rebuffs him,\nbut the King dumps a huge goblet of wine over Tyrion’s head. Joffrey commands Tyrion to serve him wine, and the\nhall erupts in laughter. Tyrion refills the goblet, and then the pigeon pie is brought out, and Joffrey calls for Ser\nIlyn’s\n sword. Sansa is horrified to learn that the King’s Justice no longer holds her father’s greatsword, \nIce\n.\nJoffrey calls for more wine, Margaery at his side, and then begins to eat some of Tyrion’s pie. He commands Tyrion\nto serve him more wine, which Tyrion does. The King then begins to cough, unable to breathe as he claws at his\nthroat. Lady Olenna and Margaery call out for help, but the \nKingsguard\n are powerless to do anything. As Grand\nMaester \nPycelle\n calls for his potions, Tyrion dumps the rest of the wine out on the floor, and Joffrey, now turning\nblack, seems to either reach for--or point at--his uncle. \nSansa\n has slipped off during the confusion, but when \nCersei\nfinally lets go of her son’s lifeless body, she commands the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion for murdering the King.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VII\n↑\nSansa IV\n ←\nTyrion VIII\n→ \nSansa V\n↓\nTyrion IX\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 61: Sansa V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa IV\n↑\nTyrion VIII\n ←\nSansa V\n→ \nJaime VII\n↓\nSansa VI\nSynopsis\nSansa\n has fled to the \nGodswood\n, and when she removes her hairnet, she notices that one of the black amethysts is\nmissing. \nDontos\n told her she must wear it for the wedding feast, but she now remembers that the amethysts are from\nAsshai\n, and that Dontos called the hairnet “magic”.
