She steps too far, however, when she declares that Robert should be the one in skirts and her in\narmor. Robert’s face goes purple with rage and he lashes out with a blow to Cersei’s face that knocks her to the\nfloor. Cersei remarks that she will wear the bruise as a badge of honor before she is escorted out by Ser \nMeryn\nTrant\n.\nRobert, in misery, asks Ned if he sees what Cersei does to him. He continues that he should not have hit her, but\nsays he does not know how to fight someone you cannot hit. Robert then declares that \nRhaegar\n won: Rhaegar has\nLyanna and he has Cersei. Ned tells Robert that they need to talk, but Robert is sick of talk and intends to hunt on\nthe morrow; whatever Ned wants to tell him can wait until he returns. When Ned reminds Robert that by then he\nwill have departed for \nWinterfell\n as commanded, Robert throws the \nHand\n’s badge of office onto the bed and forbids\nNed to leave. Ned asks about \nDaenerys Targaryen\n and is told that is done. Ned continues by asking why Robert\nwants him as Hand if he will not listen to his advice. Robert states that somebody has to run the kingdom. As he\nleaves, Robert swears that if Ned resigns again, he will pin the badge on Jaime Lannister.\nNavigation:\nEddard IX\n↑\nTyrion V\n ←\nEddard X\n→ \nCatelyn VII\n↓\nEddard XI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 40: Catelyn VII\nPlace(s): \nThe \nEyrie\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn VI\n↑\nEddard X\n ←\nCatelyn VII\n→ \nJon V\n↓\nCatelyn VIII\nCatelyn\n gets news from \nRiverrun\n that \nHouse Lannister\n is gathering an army at \nCasterly Rock\n. As Catelyn and Ser\nRodrik\n arrive for \nTyrion\n's trial-by-combat they meet Ser \nBrynden\n, who has resigned his post and plans to join the\ndefense of \nRiverrun\n. In the duel, \nBronn\n kills Ser \nVardis Egen\n and Lysa sets Bronn and Tyrion free outside the\nBloody Gate\n to take their chances with the \nVale mountain clans\n.\nSynopsis\nCatelyn\n watches dawn break over the \nEyrie\n. Below is the waterfall called \nAlyssa's Tears\n, named after \na woman\n who\nhad seen her husband, brothers, and all her children slain but never shed a tear. Catelyn wonders how large a\nwaterfall her own tears will make when she dies.\nShe asks and Ser \nRodrik\n continues with his news. Ser \nJaime Lannister\n is gathering an army at \nCasterly Rock\n.\nCatelyn’s brother \nEdmure\n writes that he has commanded Lords \nVance\n and \nPiper\n to guard the pass below the \nGolden\nTooth\n. Edmure’s letter goes on to declare that he will yield no foot of \nTully\n land without soaking it in \nLannister\nblood. Catelyn is in a foul mood and asks why the letter makes no mention of \ntheir father\n, the lord of \nRiverrun\n, who\nmust be very sick to give the defense over to Edmure.\nWhen Catelyn says that she should have been woken immediately when the letter arrived, Ser Rodrik explains that\nLysa\n thought it was better to let her sleep. He also mentions that her sister plans to speak with her after the combat.\nCatelyn declares the combat a \nmummer\n’s farce, angry that Lysa cannot see \nTyrion Lannister\n has tricked her. In\nCatelyn’s opinion it is past time that she and Ser Rodrik leave for \nWinterfell\n, planning to take a ship north from\nGulltown\n. Ser Rodrik pales at the thought of another sea voyage.\nAs the servants dress her, Catelyn hopes that she can talk to her sister before the duel. The shy girl Catelyn knew at\nRiverrun has grown into a vain and inconstant woman. When the message came that Tyrion wanted to confess,\nCatelyn had tried to convince Lysa to talk to the dwarf in private, but her sister insisted on a public show.\nAs they come to the doors of Lysa’s apartment, Ser \nBrynden\n the Blackfish is coming out. He is angry that Lysa has\nrefused to grant him a thousand men to aid the defense of the \nriverlands\n. He declares that he has resigned as Knight\nof the \nBloody Gate\n and will go alone. Concerned about her uncle travelling the \nhigh road\n alone, Catelyn suggests he\nreturn to Winterfell with them and receive his thousand men from her. Ser Brynden agrees and Catelyn and Ser\nRodrik enter Lysa’s apartment.\nLysa’s apartments overlook a grassy area scattered with statues (the remnants of a failed attempt to plant a\ngodswood\n) where the duel will take place. An elegant looking Lysa is holding court on the terrace,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>Robert is a king who is
