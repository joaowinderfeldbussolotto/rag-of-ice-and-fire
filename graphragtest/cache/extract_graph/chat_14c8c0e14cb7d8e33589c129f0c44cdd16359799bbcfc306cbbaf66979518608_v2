Theon agrees to spare them all, including Hodor, if he can, but not\nOsha, who took an oath and broke it.\nThey find the remains of a freshly killed young elk, clearly killed by the direwolves. Theon realizes that the animal\nhas only been eaten off by the wolves, and that Osha has not even cut off a few steaks. He asks Farlen if the dogs\ncould be tracking the wrong wolves, but Farlen denies the possibility.\nThey continue, but the dogs lose the scent less than an hour later, at a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains.\nThey are unable to determine where the wolves left the stream. Wex alerts them to the fact that there are only\npawprints visible, but not the prints of men, meaning the wolves entered the water alone. Theon is horrified at the\ndiscovery, realizing that Osha likely send the wolves ahead on their own. He sends Gariss, Murch, Aggar, and four\ndogs to double back and find where the group must have parted from the wolves, while the others follow the\ndirewolves, as they would not part from Bran and Rickon for long. He takes Wex, the Frey boy, and Gynir Rednose\nwith him upstream. They search on both sides of the stream, but Theon feels forced to give up at midday, when they\nstill have not found a sign of them. They reunite with Farlen’s search party, which had travelled downsteam, who\nbare the same bad news. Gariss, Murch, and Aggar, having retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell, have not been\nable to find any sign of the Starks either.\nTheon does not dare to admit defeat and suggests returning to the brook again. Little Walder Frey believes they are\nunable to find the Stark children because the Reeds are with them, citing numerous superstitions on “mudmen”. All\nmen laugh at the notion, until Luwin cites how the histories say the crannogmen had once been close to the \nchildren\nof the forest\n, suggesting they may have secret knowledge. Regardless, they return to the steam and search for many\na mile, but when the last daylight fades, they are forced to abandon the search. Reek approaches Theon, suggesting\nthat the Starks have travelled northeast, in the direction of the Umbers. However, Reek states, the children would\nneed to shelter someplace closer by, and he might know where that is, mentioning the old mill on \nAcorn Water\n.\nAlthough Theon questions why the Starks would have gone to hide there, with so many other possibilities nearby,\nReek insists on the location. He shows Theon the contents of his sack, and when Theon finds the wolf’s-head\nbrooch, he realizes what Reek is implying. He orders all but Aggar, Rednose, and Gelmarr to return to Winterfell.\nLuwin asks him to remember his promice of mercy, but Theon replies that “mercy was for this morning”.\nNavigation:\nTheon III\n↑\nTyrion XI\n ←\nTheon IV\n→ \nJon VI\n↓\nTheon V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 51: Jon VI\nPlace(s): \nSkirling Pass\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon V\n↑\nTheon IV\n ←\nJon VI\n→ \nSansa IV\n↓\nJon VII\nSynopsis\nAs \nQhorin Halfhand\n’s party moves through the \nSkirling Pass\n, they note watchers high up in the pass. Qhorin sends\nStonesnake\n and Jon to dispatch the watchers, and they are warned not to let them sound a horn. Stonesnake teaches\nJon how to climb a sheer cliff face, and they eventually reach the top above the \nwildlings\n. There are three, and after\nkilling two, the third turns out to be a woman, \nYgritte\n. She yields to them, and Jon takes her captive, despite\nStonesnake’s warning that she should be killed. When she learns that Jon is a bastard son of a Stark lord, she tells\nhim the wildling story of \nBael the Bard\n. Supposedly, before he joined the free folk, he was a raider, or, according to\nStonesnake, a murderer and robber.\nLord \nBrandon Stark\n wanted Bael’s head, but was never successful in capturing the bandit. To teach the lord a lesson,\nBael slipped into \nWinterfell\n calling himself Bard Sygerrik, which means ‘deceiver’ in the old tongue of the \nFirst\nMen\n, which the giants still speak. In return for his performance, he requested the fairest flower in Winterfell, and the\nlord gave him the rare winter rose. In the morning, the singer was gone along with Lord Brandon’s daughter.\nA year later, the lord’s daughter was found in her bedchamber with a young baby. Bael had hidden her in the crypts\nof Winterfell. Thirty years later when Bael was \nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\n and led the wildlings south, it was his son,\nthe new Stark lord, who slew Bael, since the bard would not harm his son. Upon returning home, the young lord’s\nmother killed herself when she found out Bael was dead. The young lord was said to have eventually been killed by\none of his bannermen\n.
