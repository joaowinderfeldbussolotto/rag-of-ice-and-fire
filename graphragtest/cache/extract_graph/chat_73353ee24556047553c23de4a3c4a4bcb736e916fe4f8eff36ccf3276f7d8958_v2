Varys trained a network of spies - young boys and\ngirls - to steal information, and eventually the two of them became influential enough that Illyrio was able to marry\nthe daughter of the cousin of the Prince of Pentos, and Varys was sought by \nAerys the Mad\n in his paranoia for the\npost of \nMaster of Whisperers\n.\nOver several more days' travel through \nAndalos\n, Illyrio tells Tyrion that he has managed to persuade the \nGolden\nCompany\n to break their contract with \nMyr\n and instead accompany Daenerys. When Tyrion questions how Illyrio\nconvinced the Golden Company- a group that has spent most of its history warring with the Targaryens- to side with\nDaenerys, the magister reminds Tyrion that the \nBlackfyre Pretenders\n are no more and that Daenerys can give the\ncompany of exiles what the Blackfyres never could: she can finally take them home. After Tyrion recounts the story\nof \nHugor of the Hill\n, he tells Illyrio that he had originally intended to become \nHigh Septon\n before he met and\nmarried \nTysha\n. Illyrio likewise has a story of a \nLysene\n bed slave, Serra, his second wife, who was killed by the \ngrey\nplague\n. As they continue to travel, Tyrion's thoughts turn to \nShae\n, and to Tysha.\nNavigation:\nTyrion I\n↑\nBran I\n ←\nTyrion II\n→ \nThe Merchant's Man\n↓\nTyrion III\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 6: The Merchant's\nMan\nPlace(s): \nVolantis\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n ←\nThe Merchant's Man\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nThe Windblown\nSynopsis\nQuentyn Martell\n, son of the \nPrince of Dorne\n, is in \nVolantis\n, disguised as a wineseller's servant. He and his servant\nare attempting to book a passage to \nMeereen\n aboard ship, but even in the massive port of Volantis they are unable to\nfind a single ship willing to risk the trip to \nSlaver's Bay\n while there is war brewing and the \nslave trade\n and \nfighting\npits\n are both terminated.\nQuentyn is accompanied by \nGerris Drinkwater\n, acting as his merchant master, and \nArchibald Yronwood\n. On the trip\nfrom \nDorne\n aboard the \nMeadowlark\n they were attacked by corsairs from the \nDisputed Lands\n, losing their Maester\nKedry\n, \nWillam Wells\n and his dear friend \nCletus Yronwood\n. Quentyn feels their loss keenly, and feels in dire need of\nhis missing maester's counsel.\nQuentyn and Gerris meet with the captain of the \nAdventure\n, a smuggler's ship, who agrees to take them to Meereen\nonly if they are prepared to pay three times the normal fare - for each of them. Quentyn knows that the man simply\nplans to take their money and either kill them or enslave them at the first chance he gets.\nThe pair debate whether they should give up their quest and return to Dorne, or attempt to travel to Meereen\noverland via the \ndemon road\n. Quentyn is anxious not to have any more deaths on his conscience, but he feels his\nduty to Dorne and to his father is too important to turn back. They travel through the streets to the \nMerchant's House\nto meet with Archibald Yronwood. Along the way, they encounter a party of \nWindblown\n who are recruiting soldiers\nas they head to \nYunkai\n to war against \nAstapor\n and \nMeereen\n. Quentyn tells him that they have no choice but to board\nAdventure\n - but Archibald says there is another way to Meereen, less honorable, but faster than the demon road...\nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n ←\nThe Merchant's Man\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nThe Windblown\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 7: Jon II\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon I\n↑\nThe Merchant's Man\n ←\nJon II\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nJon III\nThis chapter covers the events of \nChapter 5 of \nA Feast for Crows\n, but from \nJon's\n perspective rather than \nSamwell\nTarly\n's.\nSynopsis\nJon summons Gilly and, despite his own misgivings, forces her to give up her own child and take \nMance Rayder\n's\nbaby away with her, disguised as her own.
