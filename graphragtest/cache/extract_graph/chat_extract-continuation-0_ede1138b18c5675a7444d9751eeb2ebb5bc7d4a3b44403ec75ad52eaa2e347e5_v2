Cersei\nstates that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes. Within the Sept, the High Septon grants Cersei\npermission to visit her good-daughter, while Taena goes to speak with Margaery's cousins. Margaery is beside\nherself, stripped of her clothes and dignity, while she is asked once an hour to confess her fornication. Cersei tells\nher that she has rounded up all those that Ser Osney named, lying that they will reveal her innocence. When Cersei\nsays that a sworn brother of the Kingsguard will fight for her should it come to a trial by combat, Margaery demands\nthat her own brother, Ser \nGarlan the Gallant\n, be summoned to fight in place of the grievously injured Ser \nLoras\n.\nCersei would never allow this to happen; and Margaery, well aware of Cersei's intentions, tells her to leave, calling\nher a vile, scheming, evil bitch.\nCersei is then escorted deep beneath \nVisenya's Hill\n to speak with the High Septon. He tells her that seven will sit in\njudgment of Margaery and her cousins, as the Faith did in yore, before King \nJaehaerys I Targaryen\n stripped them of\nthis power. When Cersei asks to have Ser Osney released into her custody, the priest flatly denies her. Chained to\nthe ceiling of his cell, Osney has been brutally whipped. Infuriated, Cersei tells the High Septon that Osney came of\nhis own free will. The holy man responds, \"I have heard many men confess, but seldom have I heard a man so\npleased to be so guilty... The more diligently we applied the scourge, the more Ser Osney's offenses seemed to\nchange. He would now have us believe that he never touched Margaery Tyrell.\" When asked now if he had carnal\nknowledge of the queen, Osney points at Cersei, saying, \"Aye. That one there.\" Furthermore, he confesses that\nCersei ordered him to kill the old High Septon. Upon hearing this, Cersei bolts from the cell, racing headlong\nthrough the Great Sept. Fearing what may happen should the Faith question Taena Merryweather, she is soon\novertaken by a group of septas, who strip her and confine her to a grim cell.\nHer screams going unheard, Cersei begins to shiver from the cold. Every time she begins to fall asleep, she is jostled\nawake and asked if she will confess her sins. After two days of this torture, \nQyburn\n enters her cell. She begs him to\ntake her home, but the de-chained maester tells her it will not be allowed and she will be tried for murder, treason,\nand fornication. He reveals that Margaery will be tried by the same court, and that he delivered the Blue Bard to the\n\nHigh Septon, but despite the Faith's torture, \"he is still singing the same sweet song we taught him\". Qyburn then\ninforms her of the rapid changes made since her fall: the realm is now being governed by Ser \nHarys Swyft\n and\nPycelle; they removed Ser Osfryd as Commander of the gold cloaks and Qyburn from the small council (though he\nstill works for them thanks to his control of \nVarys\n' whisperers); Lord Orton and Taena have fled to \nLongtable\n, while\nSer \nKevan\n has been sent for to take over the Regency. Perhaps worst of all, Aurane Waters unshipped his oars and\nsailed the fleet, possibly to join Lord \nStannis\n; while Lord Mace Tyrell and Lord \nRandyll Tarly\n are marching on\nKing's Landing\n.\nDespite Qyburn's words that his unbeatable \"champion\" is ready, Cersei knows that only a Kingsguard can defend\nher in a trial by combat. She has Qyburn pen her final plea to her brother: \"Come at once. Help me. Save me. I need\nyou as I have never needed you before. I love you, I love you, I love you.
