Bran loses his temper and replies:\n“I’d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa.\nI’d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I’d fight beside him like Grey\nWind. I’d tear out the \nKingslayer\n’s throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over and everyone\nwould come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf...Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.\nMaester Luwin attempts to reply, but Bran only howls louder until the maester concedes and departs. Howling loses\nits savor once Bran is alone and he quiets. Resentfully, Bran recalls that he did welcome the Walders when they\narrived from \nthe Twins\n. Rickon was the one who threw the tantrum then, screaming that he wanted Mother and\nFather and Robb, not these strangers. It was Bran who soothed him and welcomed the Freys. Even Maester Luwin\nsaid he did well. Then they played the \nlord of the crossing\n game in a pool in the godswood.\nThe game was played with a log, a stick, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The lord of the crossing\nstood in the middle of the water and was the only one who got to use a stick. The other players had to make up\nspeeches about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and\nanswer questions. They didn’t have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said “Mayhaps,” so the\ntrick was to say “Mayhaps” so the lord of the crossing didn’t notice, then knock the lord into the water and become\nthe new lord of the crossing. In practice, the game came down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into the water,\nalong with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone said “Mayhaps.”\nLittle Walder was lord of the crossing as often as not. He is Little Walder even though he is tall and stout with a big\nbelly. His cousin, Big Walder, is sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. The names came about because Big\nWalder is fifty-two days older, so he was bigger at first. Big Walder explained that there were bunches of Walders at\nthe Twins, as well as a number of girls named Walda, all named after the boys’ grandfather, Lord \nWalder Frey\n.\n\nBran watched wistfully while the Walders played the lord of the crossing game with \nTurnip\n the cook’s boy and\nJoseth\n’s girls \nBandy\n and \nShyra\n. The Walders had decreed that Bran should judge whether people said “Mayhaps,”\nbut as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him. The shouts and splashes soon drew others: \nPalla\n the\nkennel girl, \nCayn\n’s boy \nCalon\n, and \nFat Tom\n’s son \nTomToo\n. Before long everyone was soaked, muddy, and\nlaughing. Bran had not heard so much laughter since the bloody raven arrived. Bitterly, Bran told himself that no\none would be lord of the crossing but him if he could use his legs. Then Rickon came running into the godswood\nwith Shaggydog and wanted to play. Shaggydog obeyed the command to stay until the first time Little Walder hit\nRickon with the stick. Then, before Bran could blink, the black wolf attacked Little Walder.\nOddly, after that Rickon decided he liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again, but they play\nmonsters and maidens, rats and cats, and come-into-my-castle. They plunder the kitchens, race around the walls, toss\nbones to the pups, and train with wooden swords. But when Rickon showed them the crypts under the castle, Bran\nhad screamed that Rickon had no right to show them a Stark place.\nThe door to the bedchamber opens and Maester Luwin returns with Osha, Hayhead, and a sleeping draught. Osha\nscoops Bran up and carries him effortlessly to bed. Luwin assures Bran that the draught will give him a dreamless\nsleep. Bran wants to believe him. After he has taken the draught, Osha lingers behind to ask if it is the wolf dreams\nagain. When Bran nods, Osha says he should not fight so hard, since maybe the \nold gods\n are trying to answer all his\ntalk to the \nheart tree\n. Bran fades off to sleep before he can really reply, but when the darkness closes over him, he\nfinds himself moving silently through the godswood. Part of him knows it is only a dream, but even the dream of\nwalking is better than the truth of his bedchamber.\nIn his dream it is dark amongst the trees but the comet lights his way as he moves, swift and strong on four good\nlegs. He can feel the ground underfoot and the smells fill his head. The scent of squirrel reminds him of the taste of\nhot blood and bones cracking between his teeth. Slaver runs from his jaws, and he can hear the squirrel chittering\nand rustling safe above him. He can smell his brother, too, loping around and around, tirelessly searching but never\nfinding: for prey, for a way out, for his mother, for\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b55e74dda0212147e155e6d38c001419cdd33daeca899961354af20c5c6ff046_v2"}
