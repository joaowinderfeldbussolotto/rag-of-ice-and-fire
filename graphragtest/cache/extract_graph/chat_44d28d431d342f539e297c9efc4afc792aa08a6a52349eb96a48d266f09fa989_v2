He\ncomplements him with being the most skilled swordman and spearman on the Iron Islands, to which Dagmer\ndisagrees. Although he used to be, he informs Theon that now \nAndrik\n, who serves Lord \nDunstan Drumm\n, and Black\nLorren\n and \nQarl the Maid\n are said to be the best. Theon counters, saying that Andrik is not nearly as feared as\nDagmer and claiming that raiding is no work for \"Lord Balon's best man\". Dagmer tells Theon that he is aware that\nit is Theon who feels wasted, and Theon replies that it should have been him who had his sister's command. Dagmer\nexplains that, with Maron and Rodrik dead and Theon a hostage in the north, Balon had learned to rely on Asha,\nwho has never failed him. Theon states that he has never failed Balon either, and that the \nStarks\n knew his worth. He\ncites he was one of \nBrynden Tully\n's picked scouts. He was in the first wave at Whispering Wood, and almost\ncrossed swords with \nJaime Lannister\n, prevented only by the intervention of \nDaryn Hornwood\n, who died in the act.\nDagmer tells Theon that he knows Theon is no craven, having trained him in his youth. He admits to Theno that the\nStarks had Theon for ten years, and that \nRobb Stark\n is Theon's friend. Theon replies that he is no \nStark\n but a\nGreyjoy\n, and means to be his father's heir, but needs a way to prove himself in order to achieve that. Dagmer\nreminds Theon that he is young and other wars will come in which he can prove his worth, but that they are now\ncommanded to raid. At that, Theon reveals his plan; He will give Aeron six ships to raid, but means to \"do a deed\nthat the harpers will sing of for a thousand years\", knowing that Dagmer loves to hear the song about the axe which\nhad split his jaw in half. He tells Dagmer that he is to march on \nTorrhen's Square\n, the seat of Ser \nHelman Tallhart\n.\nHelman took his best men south, and Benfred and the sons of those men are now dead. All that remains is a small\ngarrison under \nLeobald Tallhart\n. Dagmer is to make no secret of his approach and start building siege engines when\nhe arrives. When Dagmer protests that siege engines are not the \nironmen\n's way, Theon replies that Leobald will not\nknow that. Upon seeing the siege engines, Leobald will call for help, and Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, \nWinterfell\n's castellan,\nwill ride to Leobald's aid in strength. Dagmer states he will certainly be outnumbered and cannot ever take Torrhen's\nSquare, but Theon replies that it is \nnot Torrhen's Square\n he means to take.\nNavigation:\nTheon II\n↑\nTyrion VIII\n ←\nTheon III\n→ \nArya VIII\n↓\nTheon IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 38: Arya VIII\nPlace(s): \nHarrenhal\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya VII\n↑\nTheon III\n ←\nArya VIII\n→ \nCatelyn V\n↓\nArya IX\nTywin Lannister\n’s host is leaving \nHarrenhal\n. Arya has been kept busy delivering messages for Weese, and she wants\nto find \nJaqen H'ghar\n before he leaves. She finally finds Jaqen and gives him Weese’s name. As she watches \nTywin\nLannister\n lead his host out of the castle, she realizes that she has been targeting the wrong people, people who really\ndo not matter. She goes in search of Jaqen, but finds Weese’s dead body first.\nSynopsis\nThe Castle is in an uproar with preparations for \nTywin Lannister\n’s host’s departure. Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n was the\nfirst to depart, a day before the rest. \nWeese\n calls Ser Addam a great horseman and sword fighter, and Lord Tywin’s\nmost daring commander. Arya hopes Ser Addam and all his men die. She is sure that they are going to fight \nRobb\nStark\n, and wonders what Robb has accomplished.\nArya has been kept busy running messages from dawn to dust. She has even delivered messages beyond the wall,\nand considered running away except that Weese told her he would deliver her to \nVargo Hoat\n; maybe if Weese were\ndead. Weese does not know Arya can read, so he never seals his messages. That day, she delivers a message\ndemanding payment for a debt to a knight who cannot read. She reads it to him, and he tries to hit her so she takes a\nsilver banded drinking horn from him and flees, giving it to Weese. For this Arya is promised the reward of sharing\na crisp capron with Weese that night. As she runs errands, she searches for \nJaqen H'ghar\n to give him another name\nbefore he leaves. She finally asks a gate guard and is told that Ser \nAmory Lorch\n is to be castellan of \nHarrenhal\n, so\nJaqen will not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_44d28d431d342f539e297c9efc4afc792aa08a6a52349eb96a48d266f09fa989_v2"}
