Manderly goes on to add his rage at his son \nWendel Manderly\n's death at the hands of the Freys,\ncalling it murder and the Freys' claims fables. He tells Davos that the \nNorth\n remembers and his son is home,\nmeaning that his act for the Freys is almost over as well.\nHe then summons \nTheon\n's mute squire \nWex\n, who survived the \nSack of Winterfell\n. Davos is told by Robett that\nTheon was captured at Winterfell, and is currently being flayed by the Boltons. He adds that all the women were\nalso captured and marched away. Davos listens to the horrible things that \nRamsay Bolton\n does to the captured\nwomen, sending them naked into the woods with half a day's head start before hunting them down with his dogs.\nEvery so often, according to Manderly, some wench lives to tell the tale, but most aren't as lucky. If caught, they are\nraped, flayed and their corpses fed to his dogs, while their skins adorn the \nDreadfort\n. If he considered them good\nsport, he slits their throats before he flays them, otherwise it is the other way around.\nRobett tells a stunned Davos that the evil is in Ramsay's blood, sired from rape. Wyman adds that the Freys are no\nbetter than Ramsay. He also tells Davos that Roose lies and played a darker part in the \nRed Wedding\n than he has\nadmitted. In addition, Davos is told that the Boltons and Freys know the northmen are not expected to believe their\n\nlies but will be forced to accept them or else die as well.\nHe tells Davos about the mighty fleet he has built up, which Davos saw when he entered the port. Furthermore he\nhas plenty of silver in his vaults and has more heavy horse than anyone else north of \nThe Neck\n. Wyman states that\nOldcastle\n and \nWidow's Watch\n will follow his lead, all of the lands east of the \nWhite Knife\n, from Widow’s Watch\nand \nRamsgate\n to the \nSheepshead Hills\n and the headwaters of the \nBroken Branch\n will be pledged to \nStannis\nBaratheon\n if Davos meets his one price. He says he does not need a king but a smuggler. He needs Davos to\nsmuggle home \nRickon Stark\n, his true liege, and one who holds a stronger claim than \nArya\n, who is soon to be wed to\nRamsay Bolton.\nThe true story about what happened at Winterfell comes out then; Wex hid in the godswood, and \nRodrik Cassel\n was\nmurdered by Ramsay Bolton. Wex also says that six survived the siege, two of them the sons of \nEddard Stark\n. Four\nof the people went north and two went another way. Manderly insists that they must have the boy and his \ndirewolf\nas proof of his identity should the Boltons try to deny him. Wyman asks Wex to show them where they went and he\nthrows a dagger at the spot on the map. Davos looks long at where the dagger has landed, pondering whether it\nwould be better to go back to the dungeons and eat porridge for breakfast as it is better than \nplaces where men break\nfast upon human flesh instead\n.\nNavigation:\nDavos III\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nDavos IV\n→ \nDaenerys V\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 30: Daenerys V\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys IV\n↑\nDavos IV\n ←\nDaenerys V\n→ \nMelisandre\n↓\nDaenerys VI\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n begins every morning my counting the enemy ships in the harbour. Today she has counted roughly\ntwenty-five. She has an argument with her admiral \nGroleo\n, who is advising her to send her dragons to attack the\nenemy fleet. Daenarys tells him to attack with ships, but he replies that she dismantled his ships, and all the timber\nin twenty leagues has been burned so he can build no more.\nHizdahr\n has thus far had success in preventing further murders. She has had her betrothed followed and \nSkahaz mo\nKandaq\n reports that Hizdahr has visited eleven pyramids and it has been twenty-six days since a murder has been\nattempted. He surmises that he must be one of the \nSons of the Harpy\n or else these others would not have listened to\nhis words alone. Skahaz asks that he may question Hizdahr, but Dany will not let him, stating that she must trust in\nHizdahr or face open rebellion in the city. Skahaz also advises her that the fleets in the blockade all have family\nmembers in \nMeereen\n and that she should use them as hostages, a contemplation she also rejects. \nBarristan Selmy\nadvises her that she has done a wise thing.\nGrey Worm\n meets with her next to tell her that the first refugees from \nAstapor\n are arriving in Meereen and that\nAstapor is burning. Dany learns of \nthe fall of Astapor\n, and that many inhabitants have contracted the \nbloody flux\nwhile under siege, with the survivors now fleeing towards Meereen.
