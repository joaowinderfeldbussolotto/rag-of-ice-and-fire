Suddenly, horns blow and arrows fly\nas the trap closes. Catelyn can initially see the moonlight on the lances, but soon she can only hear the sounds of the\nbattle in the Whispering Wood\n. Eventually the sounds fade, and then Robb returns on a different horse with the\nblood of one of his bodyguards on his arm. They drag Jaime before Catelyn, and the captive declares that he would\noffer up his sword, but he seems to have mislaid it. Catelyn asks Jaime to return her husband and daughters, but he\nreplies that he seems to have mislaid them as well.\nTheon Greyjoy\n calls for Jaime's head but Robb considers the Kingslayer more valuable alive and, like his father\nNed, refuses to condone the murder of prisoners. Robb orders Jaime taken away with a strong guard in part to\nprotect him from Lord \nRickard Karstark\n, who will want vengeance for his sons \nTorrhen\n and \nEddard\n along with\n\nDaryn Hornwood\n. Catelyn then learns that when Jaime saw he was lost, he charged Robb’s party, hoping to cut\ndown Robb. Robb states that he would be dead if not for Lord Karstark’s sons and the others.\nDespite these losses, the battle is a resounding victory for Robb. They have taken close to a hundred knights and a\ndozen lords bannermen captive. Catelyn points out that they have only won one battle, not the war. Although they\ntook the leader, most of the Lannister host is still besieging Riverrun, and they still have to deal with Lord \nTywin\nLannister\n. Robb agrees that Catelyn is right, and declares that they still have the siege of Riverrun to defeat.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn IX\n↑\nTyrion VIII\n ←\nCatelyn X\n→ \nDaenerys VIII\n↓\nCatelyn XI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 64: Daenerys VIII\nPlace(s): \nDothraki Sea\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys VII\n↑\nCatelyn X\n ←\nDaenerys VIII\n→ \nArya V\n↓\nDaenerys IX\nKhal\n \nDrogo\n falls off his horse. \nDaenerys\n orders the \nkhalasar\n to halt and calls for \nMirri Maz Duur\n. The godswife\ndeclares that only blood magic can save Drogo. As the rite is being performed, Drogo’s \nbloodriders\n attempt to\nintervene. A fight ensues in which Ser \nJorah Mormont\n is injured and all of Drogo’s bloodriders are killed. Daenerys\nstarts to hemorrhage and Ser Jorah carries her into Drogo's tent.\nSynopsis\nKhal\n \nDrogo\n is looking drawn and swaying in his saddle. He makes no reaction as the large \nbloodflies\n circle and bite\nhim. This concerns \nDaenerys\n who is used to seeing her husband catch the hated insects with his hands, quick as a\nsnake, when they come too near. Drogo tore off the poultice \nMirri Maz Duur\n had prepared for him six days ago,\ncomplaining that it itched. Instead, he used the soothing mud plaster of the herb women. He has also been drinking\npoppy wine, fermented mare’s milk, and pepper beer heavily but not eating much. At night, he thrashes violently\nand even the kicking of their unborn child not longer seems to interest him.\nAs Daenerys reaches for him, Drogo reels from the saddle and falls heavily to the ground. Daenerys rushes to him.\nOnly half conscious and struggling in her arms, Drogo insists that he must ride, for the \nkhal\n who cannot ride is no\nkhal\n. Now Drogo has fallen from his horse and it has been seen. When Drogo’s \nbloodriders\n come up, Daenerys\ncommands that they will halt for the day and that the slaves be called to erect Drogo’s tent. The bloodriders are not\nhappy with either command; the region is not a camping ground and a woman cannot command. Daenerys insists\nthat Drogo will punish them if they do not obey her and commands \nQotho\n to find Mirri Maz Duur.\nOnce the tent is erected, Daenerys and her handmaidens bring the feverish Drogo inside and bathe him. Finally, Ser\nJorah Mormont\n arrives with word that Drogo’s fall is known all over the camp. He asks Daenerys to send her maids\naway and breaks the plaster from Drogo’s wound. The wound has festered and is rank with corruption. Ser Jorah\ndeclares that Drogo is beyond saving and that they must flee before he dies.\nDaenerys asks why she should run, since her son will be \nkhal\n after Drogo. Ser Jorah explains that the \nDothraki\nfollow only the strong; the \nkhalasar\n will not follow a baby. Instead, the \nko\ns will fight for the leadership and her baby\nwill be killed as a challenge to their authority. Daenerys insists that her \nkhas\n and Drogo’s bloodriders will keep her\nchild safe, but Jorah reminds her that the bloodriders' last duty is only to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b9d90799d30fd434a2bd205ab2706343e5bd64989e85f46715f8f86d239f90a9_v2"}
