Stannis sees through \nJanos Slynt\n’s fawning, having known the man as a\nbribe-taker in \nKing's Landing\n. The king makes it clear that after they finally vote in a new Lord Commander, he\nplans to take all the castles along \nthe Wall\n, except for the three currently occupied by the \nWatch\n, to garrison his\nforces. He also plans to either take or be granted the \nGift\n, stating that he intends to help the Watch guard the Wall.\nHe commands the builders to deliver reports on the conditions of the abandoned castles, and informs the men\ngathered that nightfires will be lit before the gates of all the castles. When \nMelisandre\n mentions the impending war,\nMaester \nAemon\n is aware that she speaks of the prophesied War for the Dawn. After the others have left, Aemon\nasks to see the fabled sword \nLightbringer\n through Sam’s eyes. \nSam\n describes the sword as glowing, yet there are no\nflames.\nStannis questions Sam about \ndragonglass\n, making it known that there are great deposits of obsidian beneath\nDragonstone\n, and that he intends to have it mined and brought to the Wall. The king asks Sam to show him the\nBlack Gate\n, as he intends to make the \nNightfort\n his seat, and Sam agrees although he is not sure if the gate will open\nfor a man not of the black. When they leave, Maester Aemon asks Sam if he felt any heat emanating from the sword,\nand he realizes that he did not. Aemon speaks of the choosing, subtly implying that Sam could do something to help\nspeed the process. Determined to put aside the bickering between the two leading candidates, Sam speaks with both\nCotter Pyke\n and Ser \nDenys Mallister\n individually. Both are aware they will not be elected and agree that Slynt\nwould be a bad choice. So Sam asks them if they would step aside if the right candidate were to be named. Playing\none off the other, using their dislike for each other, Sam sets it up so that each man will lend his support to \nJon\n that\nnight.\nNavigation:\nSamwell IV\n↑\nTyrion XI\n ←\nSamwell V\n→ \nJon XII\n↓\nA Feast for Crows\nSamwell I\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 79: Jon XII\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon XI\n↑\nSamwell V\n ←\nJon XII\n→ \nSansa VII\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nJon I\nSynopsis\nJon\n practices swords in the yard with \nIron Emmett\n, another brother of the Night's Watch. Emmett hits Jon hard and\nJon is knocked into thoughts of \nWinterfell\n and his boyhood rivalry with Robb. Part of him always wanted to become\nLord of Winterfell and resented that it was impossible for him. These feelings come up so strong that he beats\nEmmett mercilessly and has to be pulled off him. Jon goes to the bathhouse, and overhears Ser \nAlliser\n and \nBowen\nMarsh\n mentioning that Lord \nTywin\n sent a letter backing \nJanos Slynt\n’s rise to Lord Commander. They show it to\nOthell Yarwyck\n, seeking to have the First Builder withdraw and back Slynt. Jon is disturbed by the prospect of Slynt\nbecoming Lord Commander, and goes off through the gate beyond \nthe Wall\n. He is torn between his duties to the\nWatch, and the chance \nStannis\n has given him to become Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. As he is considering that he\nhas always wanted this, his thoughts change to a hunger for food. No, not food but prey - deer or elk. When he looks\nup, \nGhost\n comes padding over. He is overjoyed to see his old friend.\nJon looks at the direwolf’s red eyes. Recalling what \nMelisandre\n said about there being no \nold gods\n, only the \nLord of\nLight\n and the Other, Jon realizes that while Ghost's eyes are red, they are not like Melisandre’s. He has a\nweirwood’s\n eyes and belongs to the old gods. His mind made up, he attends the voting council for the first time. He\nis greeted with shouts of disapproval from Slynt and Thorne, learning that his name has been put forth as Lord\nCommander. Seeking to end the voting, Ser Alliser mentions that Othell Yarwyck has something to say, but the First\nBuilder abandons their plotting, and withdraws in favor of Jon. When \nSam\n and \nClydas\n go to fetch the voting kettle, a\nlarge raven flies out and lands on Jon’s shoulder, cawing, \"Snow. Snow.\" The \nBlack Brothers\n are amazed when they\nrealize the bird is \nMormont's raven\n. Jon Snow wins the vote in a landslide victory and is named the 998th Lord\nCommander, but he must soon confront Stannis with the news.\nNavigation:\nJon XI\n↑\nSamwell V\n ←\nJon XII\n→ \nSansa
