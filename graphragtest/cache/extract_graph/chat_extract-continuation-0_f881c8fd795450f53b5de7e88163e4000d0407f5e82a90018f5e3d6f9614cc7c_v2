While his \nelder brother\n supports Petyr's\nposition as Lord Protector of the Vale, Ser Lyn has taken up with the Lords Declarant. Bearing the Valyrian sword\nLady Forlorn\n, Ser Lyn is a dangerous and unpredictable man, quick to demand a duel.\nThe Lords Declarant seek to defend Lord Robert and the Vale, but do not acknowledge the Lord Protector, naming\nhim a false counselor who has been misruling the Vale. After Robert has another fit, Littlefinger suggests that\nMaester \nColemon\n try giving him \nsweetsleep\n, although the \nmaester\n seems reticent to do so. Alayne tells her \"father\"\nthat \nYohn Royce\n will recognize her, having met her at \nWinterfell\n when \nWaymar Royce\n took the black, but Petyr\nexplains that \"men see what they expect to see.\" She also asks him why he doesn't leave the Vale to take up his\nposition as Lord of \nHarrenhal\n. Littlefinger is convinced the place is cursed, especially after what happened to \nTywin\nLannister\n, \nGregor Clegane\n, and \nVargo Hoat\n. Lady \nShella Whent\n recently died without any heirs, claiming yet\nanother family that once ruled at \nBlack Harren\n's nightmare castle. When Alayne recommends that he give Harrenhal\nto Lord \nWalder Frey\n, Petyr smiles and tells her he might, but he would really like to give it to \nCersei\n, although he\nmight have to \"remove her from the game\" sooner than planned, unless she removes herself first.\nAlayne leads the Lords Declarant up to Petyr's solar, where he confounds them by saying that he would like to sign\ntheir declaration to weed out the false counselors. But Yohn Royce tells him they did not come to obtain his\nsignature; they are here to remove Littlefinger and take Lord Robert to foster at \nRunestone\n. Petyr informs them that\nhe plans to foster the sons of other lords here so that Robert will have boys his own age around. He also asks Lady\nAnya Waynwood\n to send \nHarrold Hardyng\n to the Eyrie as his ward, but the Lords scoff at this request. Littlefinger\nrefuses their demand that he leave the Vale and turn over Robert, and after he calls their bluffs of violence, Lyn\nCorbray draws Lady Forlorn, but this enrages the other Lords Declarant, and Bronze Yohn tells the knight to up his\nsteel, reminding him that they are guests. Corbray stalks off, but this has worked to Littlefinger's advantage, as he\nnow turns hostile toward the Lords. Demanding that they lift their encampment and give him one year to set the\nVale to rights or else he will willingly step down as Lord Protector, all the Lords except Yohn Royce agree, and\nPetyr emerges victorious in the parley.\nLater that night, after the Lords have departed, Alayne asks Petyr what he plans for the next year. Littlefinger\ncontinues his tutelage of Alayne in playing the game of thrones. He states that one or two of the older Lords may die\nover the course of the year, and Lord \nGilwood Hunter\n may well be killed by his younger brother \nHarlan\n, who\narranged old Lord \nEon\n's death. he tells her that he can be bought \"with gold and boys and promises.\"\n\nNavigation:\nSansa I\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nAlayne I\n→ \nCersei V\n↓\nAlayne II\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 24: Cersei V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei IV\n↑\nAlayne I\n ←\nCersei V\n→ \nBrienne V\n↓\nCersei VI\nSynopsis\nCersei\n continues to obliviously move from one folly to the next. Angered by \nTommen\n's brazen demand to sit on the\nIron Throne\n and at council, she realizes that \nMargaery\n put him up to this. Cersei refuses to give her power up to\nanyone, at least until Tommen comes of age.\nNext, she sends away the \nIron Bank\n's envoy \nNoho Dimittis\n after telling him there will be no payment until the\nrebellion is ended. She receives word from \nPycelle\n that Lord \nManderly\n had Ser \nDavos\n beheaded, and the \nFreys\nconfirmed this. Later, she speaks with \nOsmund Kettleblack\n about his \nyounger brother\n's failed efforts to bed\nMargaery. Osmund swears that the young queen likes him, but that they are never alone. The \nKingsguard\n names\nsome of those always around her, including the male singers she prefers to entertain her and her companions.\nWhen Cersei crosses the yard and finds Tommen riding at the quintain, she is infuriated. Once again, this was\nMargaery's idea, and while all those gathered are cheering the young king's jousting ability, Cersei blunders by\nsaying, \"One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did.\" Margaery astutely catches this and asks what tourneys\nKing Robert\n had won. The Queen Regent evades this by mentioning Robert's deeds at the Trident. She then berates\nLoras\n for teaching Tommen how to ride, but the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LORDS
