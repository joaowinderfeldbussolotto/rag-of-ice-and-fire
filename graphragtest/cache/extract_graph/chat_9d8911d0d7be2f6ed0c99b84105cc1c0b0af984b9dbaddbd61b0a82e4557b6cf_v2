It smells wonderful and the other rangers give them envious looks.\nAs they eat, Sam asks if Craster is a savage, as they say. After Sam leaves with the quill and parchment, Jon falls\nasleep thinking that maybe the commander will learn something that will lead them to Uncle Benjen.\nHe wakes to dawn, and Ghost is gone. Everything is coated in a fine ice glaze, and Jon thinks of his sisters, and that\nSansa would call this enchantment. He hears his name called and finds the girl with the rabbits wearing Sam’s cloak.\nShe asks him if he is the king’s brother, and he tells her he is his half-brother. Jon is concerned about Craster, but\nGilly\n tells him her father drank too much and will sleep most of the day. She then asks him about King’s justice; she\nwants to leave. Craster should not even notice since he has 19 wives. She explains that she is pregnant, and while it\nwill not be too bad if she has a girl, since Craster will let her grow up and marry her, if it is boy, he will give it to the\ngods. Nella has told her that the baby will be male, and Gilly believes she knows these things, having had six boys.\nShe continues by telling Jon that when the white cold comes, he sacrifices the boys, and it has been coming more\noften, so he has had to give the sheep, which are now gone. Next it will be the dogs. The Cold Gods come at night,\nand are white shadows. Jon thinks about the two wights, asks the color of their eyes and is told they are bright blue.\nShe tells him that she knows he did not take of Craster’s hospitality, so Jon is not bound to Craster, and asks to be\ntaken to the Wall, but Jon tells her that they are going the other direction, and that it is for the old crow to decide, not\nhim. Disappointed, she leaves.\nHe joins Dywen, Grenn and Hake for breakfast. Dywen claims he had three of the woman that night. He is not\n\nbelieved. Jon asks if Sam slept in the hall, and is told that it was impossible to sleep with the hard ground, the ill-\nsmelling rushes, and the snoring, particularly the snoring of \nBrown Bernarr\n. Jon soon excuses himself to attend to\nthe Lord Commander.\nOn the way, he passes by the scouts, and Jarman Buckwell tells him to keep a good edge on his sword since they\nwill be needing it soon enough. When he enters the hall, the commander’s Raven announces his presence with a\nrequest for corn. When the commander asks, Jon tells him the rain has stopped but it is cold. Mormont tells him to\nsaddle his horse for he plans to leave within the hour. He tells Jon that there is some food, but Jon declines, deciding\nhe will not take of Craster’s hospitality.\nHe finds Sam behind the hall with Gilly. She quietly leaves and Sam tells Jon he was hoping he could do something\nfor Gilly. Jon asks what he could have done, wrap her in a cloak and take her with them? Sam admits Jon is right,\nbut she is afraid, and maybe when they come back they can take her. Jon states the commander will not let them take\none of Craster’s wives, then quickly excuses himself because he has to groom and saddle the horses.\nAs he rides alongside Mormont, Jon notes that Craster has no sons or sheep. Mormont admits that Craster gives his\nsons to the wood, and tells Jon that all the rangers know, but will not talk of it. If he could have, Mormont states, he\nwould have taken the boys, they could raise them to the black, but the wildlings serve crueler gods. Mormont then\nasks if Jon spoke to one of Craster’s wives, and Jon admits he did. Then Mormont tells Jon that if he had his way,\nwith Craster sprawled out drunk and the new axe below, one of the wives could easily kill him. However, the Night's\nWatch need Craster, and his keep has been responsible for saving many ranger lives. Mormont can tell Jon wants to\nsay something, and tells him to. Jon states that his father said that a brutal or unjust bannerman shames his liege\nlord. Mormont responds that Craster is his own man and has sworn no vows.\nAfter Jon informs Mormont that Buckwell has told him he would soon need his sword, Mormont explains that\nCraster told them Mance Rayder is gathering his people at \nFrostfangs\n, a cruel, inhospitable wilderness of stone and\nice. Mormont expects Mance to invade the realm. Jon mentions that \nRaymun Redbeard\n in the time of his\ngrandfather's grandfather, and before that \nBael the Bard\n, invaded the realm. Mormont admits this, adding more\nnames including \nJoramun\n, who blew the Horn of Winter to wake the giants, but not only is the Watch a shadow of\nitself, Winterfell is weak with \nRobb Stark\n marching south. This is a great opportunity for the wildlings. Their only\nchoice is to find Mance Rayder and stop him.\nNavigation:\nJon II\n↑\nCatelyn II\n ←\nJon III\n→ \nTheon II\n↓\nJon IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 24: Theon II\nPlace(s): \nLordsport\n and \nPyke\n \n \nNavigation:\nTheon I\n↑\nJon III\n ←\nTheon II\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9d8911d0d7be2f6ed0c99b84105cc1c0b0af984b9dbaddbd61b0a82e4557b6cf_v2"}
