Quentyn has assumed the name \"Frog\",\nGerris Drinkwater\n now goes by \"Dornish Gerrold\" or \"Drink\", and \nArchibald Yronwood\n is now \"Greenguts\". Their\ngoal is to reach \nSlaver's Bay\n and eventually \nDaenerys Targaryen\n in \nMeereen\n without drawing too much danger or\nattention, although they keep that a secret from their colleagues.\nThe company was paid for by \nYunkai\n to fight and kill the \nButcher King\n's successors in \nAstapor\n, where they are\ncurrently mounted, three miles away from the gates. There they faced Astapor's still-untrained new \nUnsullied\n, far\nless formidable than those that Daenerys has with her in Meereen.\n\"Frog\" learns that the Windblown are going to Yunkai for provisions before marching for Meereen to fight\nDaenerys' forces. While they prepare to leave, he learns many malicious and fearful rumors about Daenerys' past and\npresent, some of them more grounded in truth than others.\nOn the way to Meereen, the Tattered Prince receives instructions from Yunkai to hunt the Astapori survivors that\nhave left the ruins of Astapor and drive them away from Yunkai, either back to Astapor or further north to Meereen.\nIt is believed that about half of those survivors are carriers of the \nbloody flux\n. The Windblown will fight side by side\nwith the \nCompany of the Cat\n, another group of sellswords that has fought against them in the past.\nThe leader of the company has however decided to play both sides, and selects a group of Westerosi men, including\nQuentyn and his companions, to make for Meereen and contact either the \nSecond Sons\n or the \nStormcrows\n, offering\nto defect to Dany. He selects \nPretty Meris\n to command that group and suggests believable justifications for their\ndecision to turn cloak. The group will have to be careful to avoid retaliation from the Company of the Cat or of the\nLong Lances\n who know nothing of their plans and might not approve or care if they knew.\nNavigation:\nThe Merchant's Man\n↑\nThe Lost Lord\n ←\nThe Windblown\n→ \nThe Wayward Bride\n↓\nThe Spurned Suitor\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 26: The Wayward\nBride\nPlace(s): \nDeepwood Motte\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Kraken's Daughter\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nThe Windblown\n ←\nThe Wayward Bride\n→ \nTyrion VII\n↓\nThe King's Prize\nSynopsis\nAsha\n is at \nDeepwood Motte\n with her men, having fled the Iron Islands after the \nKingsmoot\n. She receives news from\nBarrowton\n that \nMoat Cailin\n has fallen to \nRamsay Bolton\n.\nAt \nTen Towers\n, Asha received tidings that \nEuron\n had married her to \nErik Anvilbreaker\n, so she now lingers at\nDeepwood Motte, knowing that she cannot return to the Iron Islands without having to submit to her new husband.\nAsha takes note of the fact that Deepwood Motte is an old castle, yet not a strong one, as proven by her quick\ncapture of it. She also tells herself that she will not be captured alive by the Boltons, and will fight to the death in\nany attempt of capture. She suspects that the next attack will come from the Boltons. Of the thirty longships that set\nout to capture Deepwood, only four remain with Asha and her followers council her to take flight. Asha refuses,\nstating that she will only fights, not run.\nAsha and \nQarl the Maid\n have sex on \nGalbart Glover\n's bed and she reflects on their long relationship, regretting that\nthey cannot marry, as Qarl is too low-born. During the night, the alarm is raised – it turns out that five Flint men\nfrom the mountain clans have tried to scale the wall. Asha’s men defeat them quickly. A single survivor claims that\nthey were alone, attempting to save \nLady Glover\n. But Asha’s brutal interrogation reveals their true purpose: to open\na gate for the three thousand men coming to take Deepwood Motte.\nAsha is unsure who is leading these men and she makes the sudden decision to try to flee for their ships instead,\nhoping that the northmen have not burned the beached ships she left behind. She is confident, however, since she\nalways beaches half her ships and leaves the other half out at sea with orders to move to \nSea Dragon Point\n if they are\nattacked.\nOn the way back to the ships, Asha realizes that it is dangerous to speed through the thick woods at night and they\ncannot light torches or else attract attention and an attack from the northmen. She decides to rest with her men and\nwait for sunrise in order to flee more quickly and safely. The northmen catch up to them\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7eee49bacd0c044af287a309c1828b10bd68d901b9cc45a30d2e7efa30a9883d_v2"}
