As she pours the oil\nover the \nmaegi\n’s head, Daenerys thanks her for all she has taught her. Mirri Maz Duur promises that Daenerys will\nnot hear her scream. Daenerys insists that she will, but that she only wants the \nmaegi\n’s life, echoing the woman’s\nown words: “Only death can pay for life.” This brings a flicker of what might be fear to \nmaegi\n’s face for the first\ntime.\nThey wait for night to fall. It is Jhogo that first notices the \nred comet\n, the first star of the evening. Daenerys sees this\nas a sign to light the pyre. Mirri Maz Duur sings in a high, ululating voice at first, but her voice becomes a wail as\nthe flames engulf her and she soon falls silent. The Dothraki and Ser Jorah back away as the smoke grows thicker\nand the heat stronger, but Daenerys stands her ground; she is the blood of the dragon and undeterred by the fire. She\nknew the truth long ago, but the brazier was not hot enough. Then Daenerys begins to slowly walk towards the fire\nas sweat covers her body. She sees many images as she walks: trees, animals, and a great grey stallion. Seeing the\nhorse she tells Drogo to mount, and for a second she sees him mounted. He smiles at her and cracks a whip made of\nflame down upon the pyre and Daenerys hears the crack of breaking stone as the pyre collapses, showering her with\nash, cinders, and broken egg shell. Behind her, she can hear the Dothraki and Ser Jorah shouting. As the pyre begins\nto collapse completely, Daenerys hears two more cracks like the first and walks into the heart of the fire.\nWhen the fire dies, Ser Jorah finds Daenerys, naked but alive and unburnt except for her hair, nursing two baby\ndragons\n, with a third draped across her shoulders. The dragons match the colors of their eggs: \ncream-and-gold\n,\ngreen-and-bronze\n, and \nblack-and-scarlet\n. Ser Jorah drops to his knees wordlessly. He is followed by Jhogo, Aggo,\nand Rakharo who declare her blood of their blood, and then her handmaidens and the rest of the Dothraki do the\nsame. Daenerys knows that they are now hers as they never were Drogo’s.\nDaenerys rises and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night comes alive with the music of dragons.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys IX\n↑\nCatelyn XI\n ←\nDaenerys X\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nDaenerys I\n\nA Clash of Kings - Prologue\nPlace(s): \nDragonstone\n \n \nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nArya I\nMaester \nCressen\n broods on the omens all around him on \nDragonstone\n. When news arrives that the \nstorm lords\n will\nnot support \nStannis Baratheon\n’s quest for the \nIron Throne\n, Cressen comes into conflict with Queen \nSelyse\n and the\nred priestess \nMelisandre\n over what course to take. In a desperate attempt to kill Melisandre, Cressen shares poison\nwine with her, but dies while she remains unaffected.\nSynopsis\nMaester \nCressen\n watches from his balcony as the \nred comet\n spreads across the dawn over \nDragonstone\n like a wound\nin the sky. The feeble 80-year-old chides himself for considering it an omen, yet he has never seen a comet so bright\nnor of that color. It is even visible during the day now. At the same time, hot steam has begun to issue from vents\nbeneath the Dragonmont volcano, and a \nwhite raven\n has arrived from the \nCitadel\n, declaring the end of the longest\nsummer in living memory (10 years, two turns and 16 days); too many omens to deny. It is enough to make any man\nbelieve in omens, but the old \nmaester\n cannot decide what they might mean.\nCressen’s eventual successor Maester \nPylos\n interrupts his thoughts with word that Princess \nShireen\n wishes to see the\nwhite raven. The title “princess” is a new appellation for the young girl, now that her father, \nStannis Baratheon\n, is a\nking. Cressen bids Pylos to show her in. The shy princess enters, followed by her shuffling fool \nPatchface\n, who\nwears a mock helm made from a bucket with antlers and cowbells. Perhaps once Patchface was a good fool, but now\nhe has lost his wits and is incoherent as often as not. Only Shireen laughs at his antics or cares about him at all.\nShireen’s face is unattractive even discounting the disfigurement from a bout of \ngreyscale\n that nearly claimed her\nlife as an infant. Shireen asks to see the white raven, and the maester will not deny her since she has been denied too\nmuch during her life of almost ten years. She is the saddest child the maester has ever known and he considers her\nanother mark of his failures.\nWhile Pylos goes to fetch the white raven, Cressen thinks how the solemn 25-year-old Pylos is not a good match for\nDragonstone because\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c901322499a9e3a5b07a6988193f331d8233a9962cf84fb9b7c977c98ecf86cf_v2"}
