As he fades off to sleep, he asks Ned if he will\ndream and Ned assures him he will. Then Robert declares that he will give Ned’s love to \nLyanna\n. Last of all, Robert\nrequests that Ned guard his children. Unable to tell the truth and unable to lie, all that Ned can think of is Robert’s\nbastards when he tells him that he will.\nPycelle tells Ned that he has done all that he can, but the wound has already mortified because it took two days to\nget Robert back. When Ned asks how long, he is told that by rights the king should be dead already. Renly adds that\nRobert was always strong, though perhaps not wise, recounting that Robert slew the boar even with his guts hanging\nout. Ned replies admiringly that Robert was never one to leave the battle with an enemy standing.\nSer Barristan is still standing outside and Ned tells him that the king is not to be disturbed. Ser Barristan laments that\nhe has failed his sacred trust. Ned reassures the old knight that no one can defend a man against himself and even the\nking blamed the wine. The knight admits that Robert was reeling drunk. \nVarys\n, who has just appeared, asks who\ngave Robert all the wine, and Ser Barristan tells them it was the king’s elder squire, \nLancel Lannister\n. Varys states\nthat he hopes the lad does not blame himself. Ned informs Varys that the king wants the assassination of Daenerys\ncanceled. Varys tells him that those birds have flown but he will do what he can.\nTomard\n and \nCayn\n are helping Ned across the bridge when Renly catches up and asks for a private word. Renly asks\nif Robert’s will makes him regent and, knowing his answer, tells Ned that he has 100 swords to offer him. Renly\ndeclares that if they strike now, they can take the \nRed Keep\n and seize the royal children. Ned refuses, stating that\nwhile Robert is still alive he will not shed blood in the castle. Renly insists that every moment Ned delays gives\nCersei more time to prepare. Ned declares that they should pray for Robert’s recovery; sometimes the gods are\nmerciful. Renly answers that the \nLannisters\n are not.\nBy the time he returns to his \ntower\n, Ned is wondering if he should have accepted Renly’s offer; if the queen fights\nhe will need every sword he can get. He has no taste for these intrigues. Ned first asks Cayn to bring \nLittlefinger\n to\nhim and then commands Tomard to take 20 men to escort his daughters to the ship to take them to Winterfell. He\nthen tells Tomard to stop at \nDragonstone\n on the way and deliver a letter for to Lord \nStannis\n, for his eyes only. After\nTomard leaves, Ned sits in grief for his friend Robert and thinks how some will say that he had betrayed his king’s\nfriendship and disinherited his sons. He hopes the gods will know better and that Robert will learn the truth in the\nland beyond the grave. He then composes a letter to Stannis, telling him of Robert’s death and offering him the\nthrone as the rightful heir. As he seals the letter, Ned reflects that his regency will be short and then he can return to\nWinterfell.\nLittlefinger arrives and congratulates Ned for being named Protector of the Realm. When asked how he knows,\nLittlefinger states that Varys told him and that Ned has just confirmed it. Ned damns Varys and his birds and states\nthat he does not trust him. Littlefinger declares that Ned is learning. Ned says he knows the secret that \nJon Arryn\nwas murdered for. Littlefinger's lack of reaction to the truth shows that he obviously knew the secret all along.\nNed declares his intention to offer the throne to Stannis, but Littlefinger says he would be wise to bow to \nJoffrey\n.\nStannis is not a friend of Ned or Littlefinger; even his brothers cannot stand him because he is hard and unyielding.\nStannis will appoint his own Hand and Small Council, and his ascension will mean war for the realm. Stannis will\nseek the heads of Cersei and the children to secure his position on the \nIron Throne\n (an act that will incite \nTywin\nLannister\n and the houses sworn to \nCasterly Rock\n to an uprising), those of Lords \nTyrell\n and \nRedwyne\n as revenge for\nthe \nSiege of Storm's End\n, and even Lord \nBalon Greyjoy\n for his \nrebellion\n. According to Littlefinger, anyone who\nstood by the \nTargaryens\n during \nRobert's Rebellion\n or rose with the Greyjoys will have cause to fear Stannis' ascent\nto the throne.\nLittlefinger proposes another course of action: that Ned make his peace with the Lannisters, wed \nSansa\n to Joffrey,\nRobb\n to \nMyrcella\n, and \nArya\n to \nTommen\n and rule as Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey\ncomes of age in four years’ time. This should be sufficient time to deal with Stannis and, should Joffrey prove\nunsuitable, they can reveal the truth of his parentage and place Renly on the throne. Ned declares that what\nLittlefinger is proposing is treason. Littlefinger replies that it will only be treason if they lose. Ned tells him that he\nforgets Jon\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>King who is mortally wounded and requests Ned
