Jon\nis deeply affected by facing the wight, but does not blame his friends for not understanding. They cannot\nunderstand; they did not see the pale glow of the blue eyes or feel the cold black hands. They also do not know of\nthe fighting in the \nriverlands\n.\nGhost is lying beside the door to his room. Jon thinks back to when he found the \ndirewolf\n hidden in the snow. He\nshows Ghost the pommel of the swords, stating it is him. Then \nSam\n arrives. He does not want to see the blade,\nstating he has seen his father’s Valyrian steel \nblade\n and it was so sharp he feared he might hurt one of his sisters.\nSam then announces that Maester Aemon wants to see Jon. Jon is puzzled since it is not time for his bandages to be\nchanged, but then accuses Sam of telling the maester that he knows about the riverlands. Sam insists that he thinks\nthe maester knew anyway. Jon tells Sam that he will find the maester himself.\nClydas\n is helping Maester Aemon in the rookery when Jon arrives. The maester dismisses Clydas and asks Jon to\nassist him with feeding the ravens. As they work, Aemon explains that although other birds can be trained to fly\nmessages the \nNight's Watch\n has always preferred ravens. The old man goes on to explain that the sworn brothers do\nnot wed because love is the bane of honor and duty, which the Night’s Watch cannot afford; they must be totally\ncommitted to defending the realm from the darkness to the north.\nWhen Jon fails to understand, the maester explains that in every man’s life there comes a day when he must choose\nbetween his duty and his family, and only one man in ten thousand is strong enough to choose duty. Jon questions if\nthe maester believes this is his day. Maester Aemon only replies that he knows the choice is always hard. Jon insists\nthat the old man does not know what it feels like to be in his situation.\nMaester Aemon sighs and sadly tells Jon that his vows have been tested three times: once as a boy, once in his\nprime, and once as an old man. The old maester elaborates that the last test was just as hard as the others, regardless\nthat he was blind, frail, and helpless. He recalls how it grieved him to sit forgotten as his ravens brought news from\nthe south of the ruin of his House and the death of his \nbrother’s grandson\n, and \nhis\n son\n, and even the \nlittle\n \nchildren\n.\nJon asks who Maester Aemon is, almost in dread. The old man insists that he is only a maester of the \nCitadel\n bound\nto \nCastle Black\n and the Night’s Watch, but that his father was \nMaekar\n, the First of His Name, and that his brother\nAegon\n ruled after their father in his stead. Jon is astounded. Aemon declares that he \ndoes\n know how Jon feels, and\nso he will not tell Jon to stay or go. Jon must make his own choice, and live with it for the rest of his days as Aemon\nhas.\nNavigation:\nJon VII\n↑\nCatelyn IX\n ←\nJon VIII\n→ \nDaenerys VII\n↓\nJon IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 61: Daenerys VII\nPlace(s): \nA \nLhazareen\n town in the \nDothraki Sea\n.\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys VI\n↑\nJon VIII\n ←\nDaenerys VII\n→ \nTyrion VIII\n↓\nDaenerys VIII\nKhal\n \nDrogo\n has defeated another \nkhalasar\n, capturing a town and many captives. \nDaenerys\n intervenes when she sees\nDothraki\n warriors raping the women. When she finds Drogo, Daenerys is concerned about her husband’s wounds\nand calls for the healers. \nMirri Maz Duur\n, one of the women she has rescued, speaks up that she is a healer, and\nDrogo agrees to let her tend to his wounds in her temple.\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n moves through the trampled fields filled with the dead and wounded around the burning town of the Lamb\nMen, or \nLhazareen\n. \nKhal\n \nOgo\n’s \nkhalasar\n was attacking the town when Khal \nDrogo\n arrived. Daenerys remembers\nthat Khal Ogo was among those who shared the high bench at the \nfeast\n when \nViserys\n was crowned. However, this is\nnot \nVaes Dothrak\n. Daenerys suspects some of the villagers probably mistook them for deliverance, but once Khal\nOgo was defeated Drogo’s \nkhalasar\n plundered the town just as badly.\nNow the captives from both the village and Ogo’s \nkhalasar\n are being collected for slaves. To an outsider the\nLhazareen look similar to the Dothraki, but now Daenerys can plainly see the differences. In addition, the Dothraki\ncaptives do not seem to fear slavery, while the villagers stumble about in fear and sorrow.\nSer \nJorah Mormont\n meets Daenerys at the entrance to the village. The knight brings news that Drogo has killed Khal\nOgo and \nhis son\n, taking only minor wounds. He also informs her that most of the rival \nkhalasar\n has fled, but there\ncould still be as many as\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JON<|>PERSON<|>Jon is a member of the Night's Watch who is deeply affected by facing a wight and interacts with Maester Aemon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ghost is a direwolf belonging to Jon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM<|>PERSON<|>Sam is a friend of Jon who is part of the Night's Watch and is hesitant about seeing a blade)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>PERSON<|>Maester Aemon is an old maester of the Night's Watch who advises Jon and has a deep past connected to royalty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLYDAS<|>PERSON<|>Clydas is an assistant to Maester Aemon in the rookery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Night's Watch is a brotherhood sworn to defend the realm from threats beyond the Wall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVERLANDS<|>GEO<|>The Riverlands is a region where fighting is occurring, mentioned by Jon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIREWOLF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Direwolves are mythical creatures, one of which is Ghost, Jon's companion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAES DOTHRAK<|>GEO<|>Vaes Dothrak is a city mentioned in the context of Dothraki culture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTLE BLACK<|>GEO<|>Castle Black is the headquarters of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Citadel is an institution where maesters are trained)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAEKAR<|>PERSON<|>Maekar is the father of Maester Aemon and a former king)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AEGON<|>PERSON<|>Aegon is the brother of Maester Aemon who ruled after their father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>PERSON<|>Khal Drogo is a Dothraki warlord and husband of Daenerys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAENERYS<|>PERSON<|>Daenerys is the wife of Khal Drogo and intervenes to stop Dothraki warriors from raping women)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRRI MAZ DUUR<|>PERSON<|>Mirri Maz Duur is a healer who tends to Khal Drogo's wounds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHAL OGO<|>PERSON<|>Khal Ogo is a rival khal defeated by Khal Drogo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>PERSON<|>Ser Jorah Mormont is a knight who serves Daenerys and brings her news)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISERYS<|>PERSON<|>Viserys is Daenerys' brother who was crowned at a feast)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LHAZAREEN<|>GEO<|>Lhazareen is a town in the Dothraki Sea where Khal Drogo's forces attack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOTHRAKI SEA<|>GEO<|>The Dothraki Sea is a region where the Lhazareen town is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHALASAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A khalasar is a Dothraki war band or clan)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON<|>GHOST<|>Jon owns and interacts with Ghost, his direwolf<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON<|>SAM<|>Sam is a friend and fellow member of the Night's Watch who interacts with Jon<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>Maester Aemon advises Jon and shares his past experiences with him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>CITADEL<|>Maester Aemon is bound to the Citadel as a maester<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>CASTLE BLACK<|>Maester Aemon serves at Castle Black as part of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>MAEKAR<|>Maekar is the father of Maester Aemon<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>AEGON<|>Aegon is the brother of Maester Aemon who ruled after their father<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>DAENERYS<|>Khal Drogo is married to Daenerys<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>MIRRI MAZ DUUR<|>Daenerys allows Mirri Maz Duur to heal Khal Drogo<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>KHAL OGO<|>Khal Drogo defeated Khal Ogo in battle<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>Ser Jorah Mormont serves and brings news to Daenerys<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>VISERYS<|>Viserys is the brother of Daenerys<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>LHAZAREEN<|>Khal Drogo's forces attacked the Lhazareen town<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHAL OGO<|>KHALASAR<|>Khal Ogo led a khalasar that was defeated by Khal Drogo<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
