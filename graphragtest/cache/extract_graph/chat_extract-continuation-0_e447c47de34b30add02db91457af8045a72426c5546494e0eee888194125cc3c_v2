When supplies run low, they are forced to live on horseflesh\nand the deaths increase. Daenerys suffers with her people; she sheds much weight and her milk dries up so she\ncannot breastfeed her dragons. They will not eat the meat she tries to feed them until she remembers her brother\nViserys\n saying that only men and dragons eat cooked meat. From then on, the dragons devour several times their\nown weight in seared meat every day and begin to prosper.\nEach night, Daenerys lets one of the dragons ride on her shoulder, while \nIrri\n and \nJhiqui\n carry the other two in a cage\nslung between their horses. One day, \nAggo\n says her black dragon is \nBalerion\n reborn. Daenerys recalls that her\nancestor \nAegon I Targaryen\n's dragons were named after the gods of Old \nValyria\n, but decides to name hers after\nthose the gods have taken from her. She names the green-and-bronze one \nRhaegal\n after her brother \nRhaegar\nTargaryen\n, the cream-and-gold one \nViserion\n after her brother Viserys, and the black-and-scarlet one \nDrogon\n after\nher husband Drogo.\nYet even as her dragons prosper, her \nkhalasar\n withers. Some are forced to walk because there are no longer enough\nhorses to go around. Doreah, who has been ill for a while, develops a fever and finally grows too weak to mount her\nhorse. Daenerys stops the \nkhalasar\n and personally cares for the girl who taught her how to seduce Khal Drogo,\nholding her hand until she finally dies.\n\nAs the environment continues to worsen, the Dothraki begin to fear the comet has led them to some hell, and even\nDaenerys begins to despair. She goes to Ser Jorah to ask if the waste has an end. He assures her it does end, though\nthe way is harder than he dared to think. Daenerys notes that the knight is still suffering from the wound he took\nfighting\n \nQotho\n, but he still urges their only choice is to press on.\nA few days later, her outriders return with news of a city that even Ser Jorah can tell her nothing about. She sends\nher \nbloodriders\n Aggo, \nJhogo\n, and \nRakharo\n to scout the city. When they report that the city is dead, Jhiqui insists that\nsuch places are haunted by ghosts and best avoided. This does not dissuade Daenerys, and she leads her \nkhalasar\ninto the deserted city. Inside, Daenerys passes an empty plinth and wonders if its statue now stands in \nVaes Dothrak\n.\nThey find fruit trees and fresh water, but also bones. Irri mutters about ghosts, but Daenerys assures her dragons are\nmore powerful, though food, water, and fodder are more important. After Daenerys settles into her tent and bathes in\nsand, Ser Jorah arrives to give her a peach, which she savors. She declares that the gods were good to lead them to\nthis place, and Jorah replies that they should rest and gather their strength.\nDaenerys mentions that her handmaids worry about ghosts, but the knight points out there are ghosts everywhere.\nDaenerys remembers those she has lost and asks the name of Ser Jorah's ghost. He names his second wife, the\nbeautiful \nLynesse Hightower\n. When Daenerys presses for more information, Jorah explains that his home on the\nremote \nBear Island\n is cold and rustic. His first wife, a \nGlover\n, whom he loved after a fashion, died from her third\nmiscarriage after ten years of marriage. Soon after, he fought in the \nGreyjoy Rebellion\n and earned his knighthood\nwhen he followed \nThoros of Myr\n through the breach at \nPyke\n. Afterward, King \nRobert\n held a tourney outside\nLannisport\n, where Jorah met Lynesse and held \nJaime Lannister\n to a draw in the final joust, earning the champion's\nlaurel and naming Lynesse queen of love and beauty. That night, drunk on wine and victory, he asked Lord \nLeyton\nHightower\n for his daughter's hand, and they were married there in Lannisport. However, Bear Island was a\ndisappointment to Lynesse. Jorah went to great expense to import what she wanted, and when that failed he entered\ntourneys but never distinguished himself again. Each loss cost a suit of armor and a charger, and soon he was broke.\nLynesse was unwilling to give up her jewels, so Jorah did shameful things for gold. When he heard \nEddard Stark\nwas coming to punish him, he fled with his wife to \nLys\n. In half a year, their money was gone and he was forced to\nbecome a \nsellsword\n, and while he was away fighting, Lynesse moved in with the merchant prince \nTregar
