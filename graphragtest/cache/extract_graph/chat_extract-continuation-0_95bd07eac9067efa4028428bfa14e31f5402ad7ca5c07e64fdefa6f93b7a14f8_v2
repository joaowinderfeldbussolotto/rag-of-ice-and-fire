He ignores the provocations of the \nQueen's Men\n as Stannis tells him that he plans to\nleave the Wall and take on \nRamsay Bolton\n at the \nDreadfort\n unawares.\nArnolf Karstark\n has been urging Stannis to\nattack the Dreadfort claiming that it is lightly garrisoned.\nJon bluntly tells him that his plan will fail, earning more scorn from the Queen's Men. Stannis silences them and\norders Jon to explain his reasons. Jon explains several things; firstly, unless Stannis wins \nMors Umber\n (who is\noffering an alliance in exchange for certain conditions, namely the skull of \nMance Rayder\n and a pardon for his\nbrother \nHother Umber\n, who is fighting under duress for the Boltons) to his cause, Umber will cut Stannis's host to\npieces as it crosses his land. Second, the Dreadfort will learn of Stannis's coming long before his arrival and Jon,\nhaving seen the castle's defences, knows that a small garrison could hold the Dreadfort against many times their\nnumber. Thirdly, with the imminent fall of \nMoat Cailin\n to \nHouse Bolton\n, the combined armies of Ramsay and \nRoose\nBolton\n will outnumber Stannis 5 to 1, and will easily destroy him as he lays siege to the Dreadfort. In addition, the\nnorthern lords Stannis seeks to rally to his cause, who have suffered generations of wildings raiding their holdings,\nwill not be pleased to see his wildling conscripts crossing their lands.\nStannis orders everyone out of the room except Melisandre and Jon. Stannis again offers \nWinterfell\n to Jon, but Jon\nreminds him that Sansa is currently the rightful heir and that he cannot forsake his vows. Stannis says he plans to\ngive Winterfell to \nArnolf Karstark\n, and Jon rebuts that the Karstarks abandoned his brother \nRobb Stark\n. Robb had\npersonally beheaded Lord \nRickard Karstark\n after the latter killed two of Stark's prisoners. Jon promises a source of\nmore men to Stannis, if Stannis will let him keep the wildlings to occupy more of the forts at the Wall. Stannis\nagrees and Jon tells him of the petty lords of the mountains - \nHouse Flint\n, \nHouse Wull\n, \nHouse Norrey\n, and \nHouse\nLiddle\n. Jon counsels Stannis to march through the mountains, win the mountain clans to his side, then emerge to\nattack \nDeepwood Motte\n and defeat the Ironmen to rouse the north to his side. Stannis agrees that it is a plan likely to\nsucceed and impress the northmen. Jon also warns that the clansmen are deeply devout to the \nold gods\n, warning\nMelisandre that her presence won't be welcome. Melisandre surprises Jon by telling him she will stay at the Wall.\nHe ruefully reflects on how he has acquired a thousand wildlings whom he cannot feed.\nNavigation:\nJon III\n↑\nDaenerys III\n ←\nJon IV\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\n\nJon V\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 18: Tyrion V\nPlace(s): \nthe \nSorrows\n and \nChroyane\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion IV\n↑\nTyrion IV\n ←\nTyrion V\n→ \nDavos III\n↓\nTyrion VI\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n and his companions aboard the \nShy Maid\n continue their way down the \nRhoyne\n. As they encounter heavy\namounts of fog in the \nSorrows\n, severely hindering their visibility, \nYsilla\n insists that it is \nnot a common fog\n, claiming\nthat restless spirits surround them.\nTyrion is initially unconcerned and begins to make japes, but he quickly begins to re-evaluate the situation as the\nsurroundings grow more and more eerie. The \nShy Maid\n floats past the ruins of a palace in the ruins of \nChroyane\n, and\nTyrion recalls to himself the brief joy he once had with \nTysha\n.\nFearing an attack from the fog, Griff orders Young Griff to accompany Septa \nLemore\n to safety below deck. Tyrion\nreveals his knowledge regarding the boy, and confirms bits of information he apparently learned from his previous\nbet with \nHaldon\n. Young Griff is in fact young \nAegon Targaryen\n, although Tyrion is uncertain how he survived the\nevents following the \nTrident\n. He also comes to the conclusion that Griff is the late \nRhaegar Targaryen\n's friend \nJon\nConnington\n, the former \nHand of the King\n.\nTyrion also reveals his \nLannister\n roots to the party, but there is no time to discuss loyalties or intentions. The \nShy\nMaid\n is attacked by \nstone men\n. He helps to make efforts to ensure the safety of the now-revealed young prince on\nboard, but the dwarf is knocked into the water, dragged down by one of the stone men.\nNavigation:\nTyrion
