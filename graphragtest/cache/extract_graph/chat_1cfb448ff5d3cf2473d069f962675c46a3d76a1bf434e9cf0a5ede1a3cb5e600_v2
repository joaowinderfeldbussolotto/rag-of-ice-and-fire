When he wakes he finds King \nRobert\n angry about the abduction\nof \nTyrion Lannister\n, demanding that Ned make peace with the \nLannisters\n. Robert reinstates Ned as \nHand of the King\nand declares that Ned must sit the \nIron Throne\n because he is going hunting.\nSynopsis\nUnder the influence of the \nmilk of the poppy\n, \nNed\n dreams an old dream of the \nshowdown\n at the \nTower of Joy\n. In the\ndream as it was in life, his friends ride with him: \nHowland Reed\n, Lord \nWillam Dustin\n, \nEthan Glover\n, \nMartyn Cassel\n,\nTheo Wull\n, and Ser \nMark Ryswell\n. They were seven facing three, but these three were men of the \nKingsguard\n and\nliving legends: \nLord Commander\n Ser \nGerold Hightower\n, Ser \nArthur Dayne\n the \nSword of the Morning\n, and Ser\nOswell Whent\n. Ned had looked for them on the \nTrident\n, and at the \nSack of King's Landing\n, and at the \nSiege of\nStorm's End\n, but found them guarding this tower near the \nRed Mountains\n of \nDorne\n. In spite of Rhaegar’s death, they\nrefused to bend the knee. By the end, only Ned and Howland Reed remain alive. Ned is awoken from the dream in\nthe midst of making a promise to his dying sister \nLyanna\n after the battle.\nVayon Poole\n is calling and this wakes Ned. He is informed that it has been six days and King \nRobert\n has\ncommanded that Ned attend him when he wakes. Ned replies that he is too weak, but that he would be pleased to\nreceive the king in his room. When Ned asks for his captain of the guard (remembering that \nJory\n is dead), \nAlyn\nappears. He tells Ned that \nJaime Lannister\n has left \nKing's Landing\n, that extra guards have been put on, that his\ndaughters have been with him every day, and that Jory, \nHeward\n, and \nWyl\n have been given to the \nsilent sisters\n to be\nsent north to \nWinterfell\n. Ned remembers that Jory’s father, Martyn Cassel—who was one of his seven at the Tower\nof Joy—was buried in the \nDornish Marches\n with the others. That takes Ned back to his dream. He does not think it\nbodes well for him to dream that dream now. It is then that Poole announces the arrival of both Robert and \nCersei\n.\nNed does not think it bodes well that Cersei has come, either. Ned orders that they be sent in, and that the others\nleave, as what is to be said should be kept secret.\nWhen Robert asks if Ned knows what his wife has done, Ned states that \nCatelyn\n is blameless since she took action\non his behalf and under his authority as \nHand of the King\n. The king tells Ned he is unhappy: the King’s Hand is\nsupposed to keep the peace, but seven men are dead. Cersei corrects this to eight, as a Lannister \nguardsman\n recently\ndied of his wounds. Robert declares that he will not tolerate it and demands that Ned command \nTyrion Lannister\n’s\nrelease and make peace with Jaime. Ned angrily replies that three of his men were butchered in front of his eyes\nbecause Jaime wished to chastise him.\nCersei leaps to Jaime’s defense, accusing Ned and his men of attacking Jaime while returning drunk from a brothel.\nNed calmly reminds Robert that he should know him better than that, and that \nLittlefinger\n will confirm his story.\nRobert replies that Littlefinger only said they had been returning from a brothel. Ned angrily informs Robert that he\nwas at the brothel to visit Robert’s \nbastard daughter\n. When Robert criticizes the girl’s choice of name Ned has a hard\ntime keeping his temper as he demands to know how one could expect a 15-year-old whore to have better sense. He\nthen tells Robert that the girl is in love with him.\nNed asks for Robert’s leave to bring Jaime back to face justice. Robert tells him to leave it alone and make peace\nwith Jaime. Ned declares that if that is Robert’s notion of justice he is pleased he is no longer his Hand. Cersei\n\ndeclares, \"If any man had dared speak to a \nTargaryen\n as he had spoken to you—\" but Robert cuts her off by asking\nangrily if she mistook him for \nAerys\n. Cersei presses on regardless, telling Robert that she took him for a king, that\nJaime and Tyrion are his brothers by marriage, and that Ned dishonors them all by driving off one brother and\nabducting the other. She steps too far, however, when she declares that Robert should be the one in skirts and her in\narmor. Robert’s face goes purple with rage and he lashes out with a blow to Cersei’s face that knocks her to the\nfloor.
