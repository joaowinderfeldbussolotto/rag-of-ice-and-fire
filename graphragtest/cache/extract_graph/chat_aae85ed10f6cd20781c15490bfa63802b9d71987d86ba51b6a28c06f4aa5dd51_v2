The characters are students of the \nCitadel\n of Oldtown. The\nmain character\n is Pate, an unsuccessful student.\nSynopsis\nPate\n sits with his fellow students, \nMollander\n, \nAlleras\n, \nArmen\n, and \nRoone\n, at the \nQuill and Tankard\n in \nOldtown\n. He\nyearns for \nRosey\n, the pretty daughter of a serving maid, a fifteen-year-old girl whose maidenhead can only be had\nfor a gold coin. The other students discuss \ndragons\n, and whether there are still any in existence. Pate is waiting for\nan \nalchemist\n who has promised to meet him there that evening. The Alchemist has offered to change iron into gold,\nrequesting that Pate steal a particular iron item in exchange for some gold, and said he would be back in three days\nto make the exchange.\nMollander and Armen continue their argument about dragons. Mollander says that sailors' tales speak of dragons in\nfar places, often accompanied by a young queen. Alleras keeps splitting thrown apples with his arrows. After the\nlast, he brings up the \nTargaryens\n, telling the others that \nViserys Targaryen\n's sister \nDaenerys\n is still alive. Mollander\ndrunkenly toasts her, only to be shushed by Armen.\nLazy Leo\n appears then. Mollander bristles at his appearance, Armen asking more diplomatically whether Leo wasn't\nconfined to the \nCitadel\n for three more days, but Leo shrugs this off with a quip on the meaninglessness of time. He\nasks them to buy him a drink, since he lost his money gambling and eating elsewhere. He offends them each in turn,\nthen attempts to mollify them by confirming that Daenerys is alive and has hatched three dragons, as the tales come\nout of \nQarth\n. \nArchmaester\n \nMarwyn\n even gives them credence, Leo says. Marwyn, called \"The Mage\", is widely\nconsidered unsound, partly because of his practice of speaking to smallfolk and other unwholesome people. After\nthe others scoff, Leo adds that there is a \ndragonglass\n candle burning in Marwyn's chambers.\nThe group breaks up after that, most of the students returning to the Citadel. Pate remains with Leo, hoping that the\nalchemist will still come by. Leo needles Pate a few times about Rosey. Pate wishes he could kill Leo, but Leo is a\nTyrell\n, with relatives in positions of power. He sees the sun rising, and realizes that the night is over and the\nalchemist has not come. He leaves, with a final warning to Leo to leave Rosey alone.\nPate wanders through Oldtown in the early morning. After nearly being run down by a cart, he sees the alchemist\nstanding over him. He tells Pate that he didn't want to intrude on him and his friends. He has asked Pate to steal\nsomething from Archmaester \nWalgrave\n's quarters. Pate opened the box under Walgrave's bed, and found an\nArchmaester's iron key which supposedly opened every lock in the Citadel; after wrestling with his conscience, he\ntook it, as well as a sack of silver coins.\nHe asks the Alchemist for his gold dragon coin, and the alchemist bids him follow him someplace more private.\nThey go through several winding streets and end up in an alley. The Alchemist gives Pate the coin, but the boy\nhesitates before offering up the key. He asks the Alchemist's intentions, which he will not say, and asks to see his\nface, which is nondescript. After giving the key to the Alchemist, he turns away, feeling light-headed, and collapses\ndead on the cobblestones a few moments later.\nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nThe Prophet\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 1: The Prophet\nPlace(s): \nGreat Wyk\n - \nHammerhorn\n - \nPebbleton\n \n \nNavigation:\nPrologue\n ←\nThe Prophet\n→ \nThe Captain of Guards\n↓\nThe Drowned Man\nSynopsis\nAeron Greyjoy\n, who in the chapter is referred to as \"the prophet\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_aae85ed10f6cd20781c15490bfa63802b9d71987d86ba51b6a28c06f4aa5dd51_v2"}
