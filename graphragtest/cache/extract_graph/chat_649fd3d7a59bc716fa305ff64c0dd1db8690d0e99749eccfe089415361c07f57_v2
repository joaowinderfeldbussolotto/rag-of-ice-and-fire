To that end, he had executed\nFarlen\n, going as far as to personally execute him like \nEddard Stark\n would have done. The memory is a sour one, as it\nhad taken him four difficult blows to sever Farlen's head, afterward feeling sick about it.\nHis men would prefer to leave \nWinterfell\n, a thought that makes Theon angry. He refuses to be driven from his own\nseat, being the Prince of Winterfell. He blames Asha, feeling she had taken this long to respond to his commands on\npurpose. Reek, \nUrzen\n and \nKromm\n escort Theon to the hall, where he finds Asha in the high seat of the \nStarks\n. Theon\nis dismayed to discover that Asha brought only twenty men. In turn, she scolds him for having killed \nBran\n and\nRickon Stark\n and having mounted their heads upon Winterfell's gates. The memory of returning the bodies to\nWinterfell is a sour one for Theon as well. He recalls forbidding \nLuwin\n from sewing the heads back onto the bodies\nand placing them in the \ncrypts of Winterfell\n. Theon leads Asha to Eddard Stark's solar, where he tells her that\nDagmer\n has lost the fight at \nTorrhen's Square\n. Asha tells him she was not surprised to learn about it, and informs\nhim that Dagmer is currently leading the survivors back to the \nStony Shore\n, making Theon realize that she is better\ninformed than he is.\nTheon is furious about the fact that Asha is planning on leaving only ten of her men behind for him. \nLeobald\nTallhart\n has joined Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, Lord \nWyman Manderly\n has sent a dozen barges upriver, and \nthe Umbers\n are\ngathering beyond the \nLast River\n. Asha compliments her brother for the clever way he took Winterfell, but tells him\nthat the wise course of action would have been razing the castle and taking the two princes as hostages back to \nPyke\n.\nWinterfell is too far from the sea, and every northman is now his enemy. Theon counters her, telling her that he\nkilled two of Eddard Stark's sons to lay to rest the ghosts of their brothers, \nRodrik\n and \nMaron\n. Asha tells him that\nRodrik might feel the need to avenge Eddard's sons and asks Theon to return with her to \nDeepwood Motte\n. When\nTheon refuses, Asha leaves, telling him he shall hold the castle for the remainder of his life.\n\nAsha departs the castle with her men and Theon watches her go from atop the wall, where he is approached by Reek.\nReek offers to find Theon two hundred good men if Theon provides a horse and a bag of coin. He asks for \nPalla\n as a\nreward. Although Reek makes Theon uneasy, he does not dare kill the man, as he is literate and cunning, and could\neasily have left a hidden account of what they had done behind. Theon agrees to give him the girl if he can deliver\ntwo hundred men, and Reek leaves the castle before the sun goes down. That night Theon dreams about the\nwelcoming feast Eddard Stark had thrown King \nRobert I Baratheon\n when the king visited Winterfell. Although the\nfeast is jolly at first, the room grows darker and suddenly Theon finds himself dining with the dead. Robert's guts are\nspilling out on the table from a great gash in his belly, while Eddard Stark is headless. Lining the benches below are\nthe corpses of men he knows: \nJory Cassel\n, \nFat Tom\n, \nPorther\n, \nCayn\n, \nHullen\n, and all the others who had gone south to\nKing's Landing\n. \nMikken\n, \nChayle\n, \nBenfred Tallhart\n and his \nWild Hares\n, the miller's wife, \nFarlen\n, and the \nwildling\nTheon had killed to rescue Bran are among them. There are also people who Theon has never met, including\nRickard\n, \nLyanna\n, and \nBrandon Stark\n. Then, \nRobb Stark\n enters through the doors with \nGrey Wind\n beside him, both\nof them bleeding \"from half a hundred savage wounds\".\nTheon wakes screaming, and Wex and his guards fetch Luwin, but Theon does not dare drink the sleeping draught\nthat the \nmaester\n leaves him. Instead, he summons \nKyra\n and fucks her, but even that cannot help him sleep again, and\nshe leaves sobbing of pain. At dawn, Theon goes outside. Seeing everything belonging to the Starks around him, he\nthinks to himself he should have gone with Asha. In silence, he looks at the heads mounted atop the iron spikes of\nthe gatehouse, reflecting on what fools people could be. Although everyone had accepted his story, the heads on the\nwall actually belong to the miller's sons, who had been of an age and coloring with the two missing Starks. With\ntheir faces flayed, no one had been able to tell the difference. Theon never found Bran and Rickon.\nNavigation:\nTheon IV\n↑\nCatelyn VII\n ←\nTheon V\n→ \nSansa V\n↓\nTheon VI\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_649fd3d7a59bc716fa305ff64c0dd1db8690d0e99749eccfe089415361c07f57_v2"}
