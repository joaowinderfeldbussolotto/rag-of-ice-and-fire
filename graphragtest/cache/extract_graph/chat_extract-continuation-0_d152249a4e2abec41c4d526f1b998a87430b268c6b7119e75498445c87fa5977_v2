As he walks the castle ground, Tyrion is taken by a whim to climb the Wall one last time.\n\nHis legs are cramping too much to climb the stairs, so Tyrion takes the winch cage up. At the top he meets \nJon Snow\nwith \nGhost\n. As they walk, Tyrion asks how the recruits are doing under Jon’s instruction. Jon tells him that they are\ngetting better.\nTyrion offers to carry any messages that Jon might have south to Winterfell and is rewarded with a torrent of\nrequests. Most of all Jon wants Tyrion to help his crippled brother \nBran\n. At first, Tyrion denies that has anything to\noffer Bran, but Jon insists that words will be enough. When Tyrion agrees, Jon thanks him from the heart and calls\nhim “friend.” Tyrion, deeply moved by the gesture, quips that while many of his kin are bastards, Jon is the first that\nhe could call a friend, and they shake hands.\nThey both look out over the \nHaunted Forest\n north of the Wall. As they watch, Jon says that he has been watching for\nhis Uncle Benjen. Tyrion assures Jon that Benjen will return one day. When Jon declares that if his uncle does not\ncome back he and Ghost will go north to find him, Tyrion wonders who will go out searching for Jon and shivers at\nthe thought.\nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n↑\nEddard IV\n ←\nTyrion III\n→ \nArya II\n↓\nTyrion IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 22: Arya II\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya I\n↑\nTyrion III\n ←\nArya II\n→ \nDaenerys III\n↓\nArya III\nUnhappy at \nKing's Landing\n, \nArya\n abandons her dinner. Her \nfather\n comes to her room to talk to her and sees she has\nher sword\n out. After a long talk, he decides not to take the sword away. Several days later, Arya meets her new\ndancing master.\nSynopsis\nWhen \nher father\n enters the Small Hall after dinner has already begun Arya can tell that he has been fighting with the\ncouncil\n again. \nJory Cassel\n asks about the \ntourney\n everyone is talking about, and Eddard asks if anyone is talking\nabout the \nHand\n’s displeasure with the whole idea.\nSansa\n is tremendously excited by the prospect of a tourney and begs to be allowed to attend. When \nSepta\n \nMordane\nmentions his family will be expected to attend, Eddard agrees to ensure that seats are provided for both Sansa and\nArya. Knowing that Prince \nJoffrey\n will be there, Arya insists she does not want to attend a stupid tourney. When\nSansa taunts that Arya would not be wanted anyway, Eddard loses his temper and threatens to change his mind.\nQuickly regaining his composure, Eddard excuses himself. Once he is gone, his guardsmen start talking excitedly\nabout the tourney. No one talks to Arya but she likes it that way. Back in \nWinterfell\n she had enjoyed listening to the\nmen talk, but now the sounds irritate her because she blames them all, even her father, for doing nothing to save\nLady\n and \nMycah\n.\nAfter looking disgustedly at her cold food and the people around her, Arya pushes away from the table. When Septa\nMordane insists that Arya hasn’t eaten, she dashes away. She runs to her chamber and locks herself in. She digs to\nthe bottom of her chest where her sword \nNeedle\n is hidden. Arya thinks that if she could climb like her brother \nBran\nshe could steal some food and run away and that if \nJon Snow\n was there she would not feel so lonely.\nA soft knock on her door proves to be her father, who says they need to talk and asks politely to come in. From the\nway he talks, Arya is ashamed to realize he is more sad than angry. When she lets him in, her father immediately\nnotices her sword and asks whose it is. Arya explains that it is hers and her father asks to see it. Her father notices\nMikken\n’s mark on the blade and remarks that if his nine-year-old daughter can be armed from his own forge without\nhis knowledge, how can he be expected to rule the \nSeven Kingdoms\n?\nEddard asks who gave her the sword but Arya stays silent, not wanting to betray Jon. Her father accepts this but tells\nArya that a sword is not a toy. When asked what she thinks Septa Mordane would say about her playing with a\nsword, Arya insists she was not playing. Eddard states that he should break the sword over his knee. Arya responds\nthat “Needle wouldn’t break.” The sword having a name amuses her father, who claims that Arya reminds him of his\nsister, \nLyanna\n, who might have carried a sword if \ntheir father\n had allowed it. Arya is surprised when Eddard says\nshe looks like her aunt, who was always described as beautiful, something never said of Arya.\nEddard asks if Arya knows anything about how to use a sword, and she replies with the advice Jon gave her: “Stick\n'em with the pointy end.” She tells how she was trying to learn and sadly adds that she asked Myca\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYRION<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion is a character who interacts with Jon Snow and offers to help Bran)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON SNOW<|>PERSON<|>Jon Snow is a character who instructs recruits and interacts with Tyrion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ghost is the name of Jon Snow's direwolf, treated as an entity in the context of the story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAN<|>PERSON<|>Bran is Jon Snow's crippled brother who needs help)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAUNTED FOREST<|>GEO<|>The Haunted Forest is a location north of the Wall where Jon and Tyrion look out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENJEN<|>PERSON<|>Benjen is Jon Snow's uncle who is missing and being searched for)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>King's Landing is a place where Arya is unhappy and interacts with her father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>Arya is a young girl who is unhappy in King's Landing and has a sword named Needle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEDDARD STARK<|>PERSON<|>Eddard Stark is Arya's father who talks to her about her sword and the tourney)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JORY CASSEL<|>PERSON<|>Jory Cassel is a guardsman who asks about the tourney)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>Sansa is Arya's sister who is excited about the tourney)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTA MORDANE<|>PERSON<|>Septa Mordane is a mentor figure who interacts with Arya)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>Joffrey is a prince whose presence at the tourney Arya dislikes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>Winterfell is the Stark family's home where Arya remembers happier times)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY<|>PERSON<|>Lady is a character Arya blames others for not saving)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYCAH<|>PERSON<|>Mycah is another character Arya blames others for not saving)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEEDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Needle is the name of Arya's sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKKEN<|>PERSON<|>Mikken is the blacksmith who forged Arya's sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN KINGDOMS<|>GEO<|>The Seven Kingdoms is the realm Eddard Stark is expected to rule)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYANNA<|>PERSON<|>Lyanna is Eddard Stark's sister who Arya reminds him of)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOURNEY<|>EVENT<|>The tourney is an event that Sansa is excited about and Arya dislikes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Hand is a position of authority displeased with the tourney)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>JON SNOW<|>Tyrion interacts with Jon Snow at the Wall and offers to help his brother Bran<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>BRAN<|>Jon Snow is concerned about his brother Bran and asks Tyrion for help<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>GHOST<|>Ghost is Jon Snow's direwolf companion<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>BENJEN<|>Jon Snow is searching for his missing uncle Benjen<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>NEDDARD STARK<|>Arya is the daughter of Eddard Stark who talks to her about her sword<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>NEEDLE<|>Arya owns and practices with the sword named Needle<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>SANSA<|>Arya and Sansa are sisters with differing opinions on the tourney<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>SEPTA MORDANE<|>Septa Mordane is a mentor figure to Arya<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>JOFFREY<|>Arya dislikes Joffrey and does not want to attend the tourney because of him<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Arya remembers happier times in Winterfell<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>LADY<|>Arya blames others for not saving Lady<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>MYCAH<|>Arya blames others for not saving Mycah<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>JON SNOW<|>Arya feels less lonely when thinking about Jon Snow<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>BRAN<|>Arya thinks about her brother Bran and his climbing abilities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEDDARD STARK<|>SEVEN KINGDOMS<|>Eddard Stark is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEDDARD STARK<|>LYANNA<|>Eddard Stark compares Arya to his sister Lyanna<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEDDARD STARK<|>TOURNEY<|>Eddard Stark is displeased with the idea of the tourney<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>TOURNEY<|>Sansa is excited about attending the tourney<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JORY CASSEL<|>TOURNEY<|>Jory Cassel asks about the tourney<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAND<|>TOURNEY<|>The Hand is displeased with the tourney<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
