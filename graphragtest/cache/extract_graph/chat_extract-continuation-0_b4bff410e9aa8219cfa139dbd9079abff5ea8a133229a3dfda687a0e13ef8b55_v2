Pycelle pleads that Robert\nwas a wretched king, that \nRenly\n was plotting to bring \nMace Tyrell\n’s \ndaughter\n to court and have Cersei supplanted as\nQueen. Tyrion asks what Lord Arryn had been plotting, and Pycelle explains that Jon Arryn knew of Cersei’s incest.\nPycelle also knew that Lord Jon planned to send \nhis wife\n back to the Eyrie, \nhis son\n to foster on \nDragonstone\n, and\nthat he meant to act on his knowledge. Thanks to Shagga’s axe making closer and closer shaves of Pycelle's neck,\nTyrion finally gets him to confess that he had a hand in the death of \nJon Arryn\n by assuring he wouldn't receive\n\neffective treatment because he knew about the father of Cersei’s children. He tells them he knew that Cersei wanted\nJon dead but could not say it since Varys was always listening. He sent \nColemon\n away because he was purging Jon.\nThen Pycelle attempts to blame \nHugh\n for the poisoning, telling Tyrion that Varys can tell him. Disgusted, Tyrion\norders Pycelle thrown into one of the black cells.\nWhen Pycelle is gone, Tyrion searches the quarters and collects a few more small jars, thinking how he wished\nPycelle was the one he could have trusted; Varys and Littlefinger are no more loyal, just more subtle and thus more\ndangerous. Tyrion suspects his father's method might be best; send for \nIlyn Payne\n, have all three of their heads\nmounted above the gates and be done with it.\nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nTheon II\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nArya VI\n↓\nTyrion VII\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 26: Arya VI\nPlace(s): \nThe \nRiverlands\n on the way to \nHarrenhal\n - \nHarrenhal\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya V\n↑\nTyrion VI\n ←\nArya VI\n→ \nDaenerys II\n↓\nArya VII\nEight days pass before they leave the village. Each day, one of them is tortured by the \nTickler\n for information about\nwhere valuables and food is hidden (with little result) and the whereabouts of Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n (for no\ninformation). Finally they are marched to \nHarrenhal\n to serve under \nTywin Lannister\n. \nArya\n, after complaining about\nbeing assigned to the kitchen, is assigned to the understeward in the \nWailing Tower\n, \nWeese\n.\nSynopsis\nFear has become part of \nArya\n's daily life as she walks the hard, rutted roads among a group of prisoners of \nGregor\nClegane\n and his men, a kind of fear she had never known until she was held captive in that storehouse at the shore of\nthe \nGods Eye\n. They spent eight days in the village and are now leaving on Clegane's command, and every day she\nhas seen someone die.\nThe Mountain came into the storehouse each morning after breakfast to pick one of them to be interrogated. The\nvillage folk did not dare to look at him, maybe hoping they would escape his attention. But there was no way to hide\nfrom him, no way to be safe. He just chose whomever he liked. There was a girl he picked on the fourth day who\nhad slept with a soldier three nights running, yet the soldier said nothing. There was an old man he picked on the\nfifth day, who had mended their clothing and declared so often that his son served in the \nCity Watch\n and did all for\nJoffrey\n that the other prisoners had actually started calling him \nAll-for-Joffrey\n. There was a young mother with a\npox-scarred face who had told Clegane everything she knew on the expectation they would spare her daughter for it,\nonly to see her daughter be picked the next morning to make certain the mother held nothing back.\nThe interrogations always went down the same way. They were done in front of the whole group, so that everyone\nknew what happened to rebels and traitors. They call the ordinarily looking man who did the questioning \nthe\nTickler\n. He was assisted by \nChiswyck\n, the old stoop-shouldered man who smashed Arya's head when they caught\nher, or by someone else, with Clegane just watching and listening until the prisoners died, which they invariably did.\nThe questions were always about valuables or food hidden in the village, about the whereabouts of \nBeric Dondarrion\nand the size of his band and about who of the villagers had assisted them. They found a few valuables from the\ninterrogations, but only got wildly inconsistent information about Dondarrion and his men. The longest someone\nsurvived the Tickler's treatment was until evenfall. The bodies were hung by the fires as food for the wolves.\nThe time in the storehouse has taught Arya that she is no \nWater Dancer\n. \nSyrio Forel\n would have never let them\nknock him down, take his sword, just watch as \nLommy Greenhands\n was killed, or sit meekly by in that storehouse\ndoing nothing while others died. She hates the villagers for being sheep almost as much as she hates herself for\nbeing a lamb, not a direwolf as the sigil of her house suggests.
