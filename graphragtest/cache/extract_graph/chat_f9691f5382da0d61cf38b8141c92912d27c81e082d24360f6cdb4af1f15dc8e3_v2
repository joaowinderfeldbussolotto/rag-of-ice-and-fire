While she is being treated by \nJeyne Heddle\n, Brienne learns that \nBiter\n is dead, skewered\nthrough the head by a spear wielded by \nGendry\n. \nLem\n, now wearing \nSandor\n's steel dog helm, tells her that Stoneheart\nwants her hanged for her \"crimes\". Brienne fully awakens in \na cave\n, where she meets \nThoros of Myr\n. The red priest\nis a ghost of his former self, and he informs her about the current state of the former \nBrotherhood Without Banners\n:\n\"Lord \nBeric\n's fire has gone out of this world... A grimmer shadow leads us in his place... War makes monsters of us\nall.\"\nBefore long, Brienne is brought before Lady Stoneheart, where she as well as \nPod\n and Ser \nHyle\n will be judged.\nBrienne cannot see Stoneheart's face, but notices her holding a bronze crown ringed by iron swords. A northman,\nmost likely \nHarwin\n, places \nOathkeeper\n before Stoneheart, along with Brienne's writ signed by King \nTommen\n. The\noutlaws see this as irrefutable proof that the Maid of Tarth is about \nLannister\n business. Her words are wasted here,\nas her pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears. Finally, Lady Stoneheart speaks, needing to place her hand over her\nthroat in order to gurgle out her judgment. Upon removing her hood, Brienne is horrified to discover that the\nHangwoman is actually Lady Catelyn Stark, albeit now a specter from the grave. Thoros reveals that it was Lord\nBeric himself who administered the kiss of life to her, finally extinguishing his own unnatural life.\nStoneheart gives Brienne an ultimatum: kill Ser \nJaime Lannister\n or be hanged. When the Maid states that she will\nnot make that choice, the thing that had been Catelyn Stark orders them hanged. Despite Ser Hyle's pleas for mercy,\nand Podrick's stoicism, nooses are looped about all three of their necks. As they are hefted upward, thrashing and\ndying, Brienne screams out a word...\nNavigation:\nBrienne VII\n↑\nAlayne II\n ←\nBrienne VIII\n→ \nCersei X\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 43: Cersei X\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei IX\n↑\nBrienne VIII\n ←\nCersei X\n→ \nJaime VII\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nCersei I\nSynopsis\nAccompanied by six newly reinstated \nWarrior's Sons\n, Septa \nMoelle\n brings word to the court that Queen \nMargaery\nand her cousins have been imprisoned at the \nGreat Sept of Baelor\n for adultery and high treason. The Septa reveals\nthat Margaery's maidenhead is not intact. Grand Maester \nPycelle\n also reluctantly discloses to the Septa that\nMargaery has had him mix \nmoon tea\n on many occasions. Leaving the throne room confident that Margaery was\nfinished, \nCersei\n agrees with \nAurane Waters\n' request to launch his new dromonds, in case Lord \nMace Tyrell\n decides\nto march on \nKing's Landing\n to save his daughter. Lord \nOrton Merryweather\n remarks that the High Septon may want\nto try Margaery himself, as the Faith used to do. Cersei hopes he is right.\nCersei has \nTommen\n sign some blank warrants, which she then affixes names to. Summoning Ser \nOsfryd\n, she orders\nhim to arrest Ser \nTallad\n, the \nBlue Bard\n, \nHugh Clifton\n, \nMark Mullendore\n, as well as the \nRedwyne\n twins whom she\nwants to be found innocent of the charges of bedding Margaery. The next morning, Cersei and \nTaena\n are carried by\nlitter to the Great Sept. On the way, Lady Merryweather inquires, \"What if Margaery demands that her innocence be\ndetermined by battle?\" Cersei smiles, and replies that she must be championed by a knight of the \nKingsguard\n, but\nsince Ser \nOsmund\n is brother to one of her accusers, that leaves only Ser \nMeryn Trant\n and Ser \nBoros Blount\n. Cersei\nstates that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes.
