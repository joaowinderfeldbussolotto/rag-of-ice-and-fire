As she excitedly hugs the cat to her chest and gives it\na kiss, she is interrupted. Princess \nMyrcella\n, at the end of the alley, asks what “that boy” is doing with that cat. With\nher are a couple of the Lannister household guards, a septa, and Prince \nTommen\n. She asks again, and calls Arya a\nragged boy, which Tommen agrees with. Arya pauses a moment to look at her ragged clothing (you don’t wear silks\nand skirts when catching cats). To avoid being recognized, Arya falls to one knee. The septa tells her that she does\nnot belong in this part of the castle. Arya is sure that as soon as she speaks the children will recognize her. The septa\ntells the guards to bring Arya to her. Arya panics and escapes the grasp of the guard, runs over the prince, and avoids\nthe other guard. After a short chase, Arya sees a window above her, not much more that an arrow slit wide. She\nleaps up, grabs the sill, and pulls herself through, holding her breath to get through.\nArya continues her rush, ending up lost in a dark cellar and thinking of the trouble she will be in if she was\nrecognized. After listening for a long time, she hears no pursuit. She remembers her nightmares of getting lost in the\nRed Keep\n, even though her father had told her it was smaller than \nWinterfell\n. Arya plans to count to 10,000; by then\nit will be safe to come out.\nBy the time she reaches 87, Arya can make out the large shapes of monsters all around her. Initially she is afraid, but\nshe soon overcomes her fear and makes her way over to touch one of the monsters. She can tell it is bone and that it\nis dead, but has a feeling that it knows she is there and that it does not love her. She backs into a larger one and\nwhirls around, causing a tooth to rip her leather jerkin. She runs, avoiding a larger monster, and dashes through the\njaws of another to find a door. She opens it enough to slip through into the even darker hall beyond. She remembers\nthat a \nWater Dancer\n can see without eyes. As she proceeds down the hall by feeling the walls, Arya remembers that\nall hallways lead somewhere. Then she hears noises and sees a dim flickering light, which allows her to see that she\nis above a well with steps leading down.\nArya can see two men coming up the well and hears the echo of their voices, one of which is thick with the accent of\nthe \nFree Cities\n. She quickly discovers that the men are talking about \nher father\n when one explains to the other that\nthe \nHand\n will soon learn the truth. When the second man asks what the Hand will do with the truth, the first replies\nthat only the gods know, because the Hand is not a man to put aside the attempt on \nhis son\n’s life and that soon \nthe\n\nwolf\n and \nthe lion\n will be at each other’s throats. The other man insists that a war now would do no good because\nthey are not ready.\nAs the men get nearer, Arya can see more of them. The one bearing the torch is fat with a scarred face and a stubble\nbeard who moves quietly despite wearing heavy boots and a steel cap. Arya finds him \noddly familiar\n but cannot\nrecognize him. She is sure that she has never met the man with the accent. \nHe\n has a forked beard and is grossly fat,\nyet moves lightly like a Water Dancer.\nWhen the torchbearer asks what he might possibly do to prevent a war, the fork-bearded man asks, “If \none Hand\n can\ndie, why not a second?” The torchbearer insists that times have changed and that the current Hand is not like the\nother. The fork-bearded man insists that they need more time: \nthe princess\n is with child and the \nkhal\n will not bestir\nhimself until his son is born.\nThe torchbearer insists that if the \nkhal\n does not bestir himself soon it may be too late, because there are new players\nin the game. \nStannis Baratheon\n and \nLysa Arryn\n are rumored to be marshalling their strength, Lord \nRenly\n and the\nKnight of Flowers\n plan to make \nMargaery Tyrell\n King \nRobert\n’s new queen, and no one knows what \nLittlefinger\n is\nplaying at. Yet the torchbearer insists that Eddard Stark worries him the most; he now has \nthe book\n and \nthe bastard\nand soon the truth. \nHis wife\n has also taken \nthe Imp\n prisoner and \nJaime\n and Lord \nTywin\n will take this for an outrage.\nThe torchbearer claims that, even with his skill, he cannot keep control much longer, but does agree to do what he\ncan, saying he requires more gold and 50 more “birds.” The forked beard responds that 50 is a lot, given that they\nare so young to know their letters. He suggests that if they could keep their tongues it would be easier, but the\ntorchbearer replies that the risk is too great.\nArya follows the two men for a long time, going deeper and deeper down the hall until dirt and timbers replace the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_56d5c7d2e2e4396a280c64d201d489f7c523792f3dbf56ff7adf0d4c58a7427d_v2"}
