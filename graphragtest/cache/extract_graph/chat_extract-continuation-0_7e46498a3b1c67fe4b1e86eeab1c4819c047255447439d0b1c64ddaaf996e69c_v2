The figures speak inside\nDany’s head:\nwe know… the shape of shadows… morrows not yet made… drink from the cup of ice… drink from the cup of\nfire… Mother of Dragons… Child of Three… three heads has the dragon… three fires must you light: one for\nlife and one for death and one to love… three mounts must you ride: one to bed and one to dread and one to\nlove… three treasons will you know: once for blood and once for gold and once for love… daughter of death,\n\nslayer of lies, bride of fire…\nShe now sees visions in her head, floating faster and faster:\n1\n. \nViserys\n dying;\n2\n. \na tall lord with copper skin and silver hair bearing the banner of a fiery stallion;\n3\n. \na dying prince with rubies flying from his armor whispering the name of a woman with his last breath;\n4\n. \na blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who casts no shadow;\n5\n. \na cloth dragon amidst a cheering crowd;\n6\n. \na great stone beast flying from a smoking tower, breathing shadow fire;\n7\n. \nher Silver horse given to her by \nDrogo\n at her wedding;\n8\n. \na corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, smiling sadly;\n9\n. \na blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice;\n10\n. \nshadows dancing in a tent;\n11\n. \na little girl running toward a house with a red door;\n12\n. \nMirri Maz Duur\n shrieking in the flames as a dragon bursts from her;\n13\n. \na corpse being dragged behind a silver horse;\n14\n. \na white lion running through grass taller than a man;\n15\n. \na line of naked crones emerging from a lake, kneeling before Daenerys beneath the \nMother of Mountains\n;\n16\n. \nten thousand slaves crying \"Mother\" as Daenerys rides by on her silver.\nAt this point, the visions turn to a nightmare as the Undying try to consume Dany, and she is helpless to stop them\nuntil Drogon starts to tear the corrupted heart to pieces. Fleeing from the burning House of the Undying, Pyat Pree\nattacks her with a dagger, but Drogon interrupts him long enough for Daenerys to hear \nJhogo\n’s whip crack, and then\nshe is in the arms of Ser \nJorah\n.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys III\n↑\nArya IX\n ←\nDaenerys IV\n→ \nTyrion XI\n↓\nDaenerys V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 49: Tyrion XI\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion X\n↑\nDaenerys IV\n ←\nTyrion XI\n→ \nTheon IV\n↓\nTyrion XII\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n dispatches his clansmen into the \nkingswood\n to raid \nStannis\n's baggage trains, ambush his scouts, and perform\nnight raids. Tyrion feels he can trust only about a quarter of the 6,000 men in the \nCity Watch\n, and feels unprepared\nfor the coming battle. He orders \nBronn\n to start burning down the houses along the wall by the quay, feeling that the\nenemy could scale the wall easier by climbing on the roofs of the houses. Tyrion is aware that \nWinterfell\n has fallen\nto the \nironmen\n. \nBalon Swann\n has been named to the Kingsguard to replace \nPreston Greenfield\n, and Tyrion approves,\nbut he does not approve of Cersei’s choice of \nOsmund Kettleblack\n to replace \nBoros Blount\n. Blount was stripped of\nhis white cloak after he surrendered \nTommen\n immediately when \nJacelyn\n’s men overtook them. Blount is rotting in\nRosby\n’s dungeon on the count of treason, since the Kingsguard are supposed to give their lives in defending the\nroyal family.\nTyrion has appointed the new \nHigh Septon\n, and tells him to warn the people that Stannis means to burn the \nGreat\nSept of Baelor\n. Tyrion is also visited by \nHallyne\n the Pyromancer from the \nAlchemists' Guild\n, and is surprised to\nlearn that they have 13,000 jars of \nwildfire\n, way ahead of schedule. When Tyrion asks why, the pyromancer explains\nthat their spells have been more potent of late, but is at a loss to explain why. He does ask Tyrion if there are any\ndragons\n about, and elaborates something he heard a long time ago, that magic began to disappear from the world\nwhen the last dragon died.\nJacelyn informs Tyrion that Tommen is safe, but the Hand does not know where the boy is being kept in case Tyrion\nis captured and tortured by the invaders. \nVarys\n then informs Tyrion of a plot by several merchants calling\nthemselves \nAntler Men\n to arm commoners in the streets. Tyrion writes the order for their arrest, one of them being\nthe master smith \nSalloreon\n.\nNavigation:\nTyrion X\n↑\nDaenerys IV\n ←\nTyrion XI\n→ \nTheon IV\n######################\nOutput:",
