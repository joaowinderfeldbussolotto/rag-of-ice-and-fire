She knows that open battle will cost her many lives, even though her commanders feel she will win\neasily. Daenerys tells her men to invite the two sellsword Captains, as well as the Yunkish leader. The first to arrive\nare the three Captains of the \nStormcrows\n, who spurn her offer to join her, although she notices \nDaario Naharis\n smile\nat her as they leave. The Captain of the \nSecond Sons\n also laughs at her offer, but does accept a wagonload of wine to\nbring to his men. The master slaver brings Daenerys chests full of gold hoping she will leave Yunkai alone, but she\nsends him off with his gold and a warning that she will attack in three days time.\nAfter he leaves, Daenerys tells her commanders that they will attack that night, since none of Yunkai’s defenders\nwill be expecting it. Soon after, Daario returns with the heads of the other two Stormcrow Captains, and swears the\nservice of his company. \nJorah\n warns her not to trust the \nTyroshi\n, yet she commands the battle to commence as\nplanned. During the fight, she asks \nArstan\n to tell her more of her brother \nRhaegar\n. Whitebeard explains that the\nPrince was always melancholy, and a sense of doom hung over him. \"He was born in grief, and that shadow hung\nover him all his days.\" Daenerys knows that it was the shadow of \nSummerhall\n that Arstan was referring to. Word\narrives that her army won the battle easily during the night, with the help of the Stormcrows, and all the Second\nSons too drunk to fight. Daenerys commands her men to spare any who threw down their swords, and promised to\nfree any slaves. Once again, Daenerys’ army swells to even greater size.
