He goes on to complain that he does not\nhave sufficient men to patrol and mentions the Lord Commander’s own order to stay close to the Wall following\nBenjen’s disappearance.\nMormont asks how the men died. A quick examination shows that Jafer was killed by an axe blow to the neck and\nthat Othor is riddled with wounds. The old forester \nDywen\n suggests that Othor was known to carry an axe. Ser\nJaremy points out that \nwildlings\n carry axes as well, suggesting it to be the work of \nMance Rayder\n, which Mormont\nfinds questionable so close to the Wall. Ser Jaremy asks who else it could have been. Jon knows the answer, they all\ndo, but \nthe Others\n have been gone for 8,000 years if they ever existed at all.\nMormont declares that if Benjen had been attacked so close to \nCastle Black\n, he would have returned for more men\nbefore going after the attackers. Ser Jaremy suggests that, sometime in the six months that Benjen has been gone, his\nparty might have been attacked by wildlings and that Othor and Jafer were only the last survivors. To support this\nclaim, the knight points out that the two bodies cannot have been dead for more than a day.\nSam\n now speaks up. The fat boy is present to be the eyes of blind old Maester \nAemon\n, but Jon had to force the\ncowardly boy to even look at the bodies. Now Sam insists that Ser Jaremy is wrong about the bodies. At the Lord\nCommander’s urging, Sam points out that the blood in the corpses’ veins is dry and crusty, as if they have been dead\nfor a long time. However, the bodies do not stink and have not begun to decompose; they are also untouched by\nmaggots or scavengers. Suspicious of the untouched nature of the corpses, Mormont orders \nChett\n to bring one of the\nhounds closer, but no matter how hard he tries, the hound fights to stay away from the bodies. In addition, Sam\npoints out that there are no pools of blood to indicate the men were killed there, indicating that the bodies have been\nmoved. The old forester Dywen and Ser Jaremy also note that they do not recall either Othor or Jafer having blue\neyes.\nSeveral of the other rangers urge that the bodies should be burned, but the Lord Commander wants Maester Aemon\n\nto examine them further. It proves impossible to tie the bodies to the horses, who panic at their proximity to the\ncorpses, so they are carried back on crude slings.\nLord Commander Mormont orders Ser Jaremy to search the area for ten leagues around, using hunters and foresters\nif he does not have enough men. If Benjen or any more of his men are around he will have them found, and if there\nis anyone else around, he will have them found as well.\nAs they ride back, Jon follows the Lord Commander and finds that it is too warm, with the Wall weeping copiously.\nThis weather is called by the old men “Sprit Summer,” when the season is giving up its ghosts. This means that\nwinter is coming, and a long summer means a long winter. Jon now thinks back to the stories that \nOld Nan\n told of\nthe Others coming riding in the dark and everything, including cities, falling before them and how they feed their\nservants on the flesh of human children.\nWhen they finally see the Wall, Lord Commander Mormont calls for Sam and compliments him, telling him that he\nis fat but not stupid.\nWhen they arrive at the gate, the Lord Commander is told by \nBowen Marsh\n, the Lord Steward, that there has been a\nraven. Mormont orders the bodies put in a storage room. Meanwhile, Jon notices everyone is looking at him and\nknows something is wrong. Jon searches out his friends and \nPyp\n tells him that King \nRobert\n is dead. Jon wonders if\nhis father will now return to \nWinterfell\n and decides that when he visits he will ask for the truth about his mother. His\nfriends ask about the bodies, but Jon only says they were queer.\nAs he walks to the Lord Commander’s Tower Jon notices the stares again, and when he arrives he is told that\nMormont wants to see him. When he enters, Mormont surprises him with an offer of wine and asks him to sit. Jon\nstates that it is grievous news about his father and the king which Mormont confirms. The Lord Commander tells\nJon that it is said that the king loved to hunt and that the things we love destroy us every time. He then states that if\nit had not been for the love a woman, his son \nJorah\n would not have thought to sell poachers into slavery. Jon does\nnot understand, but the Lord Commander gives no answer, only a repeated order to sit and drink.\nJon is told that his father has been imprisoned as a traitor for plotting with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to\nPrince Joffrey\n. Jon denies that his father could ever be a traitor, but then recalls that he fathered a bastard; where was\nthe honor in that? The Lord Commander explains that he plans to use his contacts in \nKing's Landing\n to ensure that\nEddard is allowed to take the black; they could use men of Eddard’s ability on the Wall\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RANGERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Members of the Night's Watch who patrol beyond the Wall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OTHOR<|>PERSON<|>A deceased ranger found with wounds, possibly killed by an axe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER JAREMY<|>PERSON<|>A knight who questions the circumstances of the rangers' deaths and suggests wildling involvement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAFFER<|>PERSON<|>A deceased ranger killed by an axe blow to the neck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORMONT<|>PERSON<|>Lord Commander of the Night's Watch who investigates the deaths of Othor and Jafer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DYWEN<|>PERSON<|>An old forester who suggests Othor carried an axe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILDLINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Free folk living beyond the Wall, suspected of attacking rangers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANCE RAYDER<|>PERSON<|>Leader of the wildlings, suspected of involvement in the rangers' deaths)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE OTHERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mythical beings believed to have been gone for 8,000 years, possibly responsible for the deaths)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTLE BLACK<|>GEO<|>Headquarters of the Night's Watch near the Wall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM<|>PERSON<|>A young member of the Night's Watch who observes unusual details about the corpses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>PERSON<|>Blind maester of the Night's Watch who is to examine the corpses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHETT<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch ordered to bring a hound near the corpses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD NAN<|>PERSON<|>A storyteller who told tales of the Others and their destruction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWEN MARSH<|>PERSON<|>Lord Steward of the Night's Watch who informs Mormont of a raven's message)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYP<|>PERSON<|>A friend of Jon who informs him of King Robert's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>Deceased king whose death affects political events in Westeros)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The Stark family's ancestral home where Jon's father may return)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JORAH<|>PERSON<|>Son of Mormont who sold poachers into slavery due to a woman's influence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCE JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>Prince who is to inherit the throne, leading to political conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>Capital city where Mormont has contacts to help Eddard Stark)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDDARD STARK<|>PERSON<|>Jon's father, imprisoned as a traitor for plotting against Prince Joffrey)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OTHOR<|>JAFFER<|>Both Othor and Jafer were rangers found dead under mysterious circumstances<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER JAREMY<|>MORMONT<|>Ser Jaremy reports to Mormont and discusses the deaths of the rangers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MORMONT<|>CASTLE BLACK<|>Mormont is the Lord Commander based at Castle Black<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAM<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>Sam serves as the eyes for the blind Maester Aemon<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MORMONT<|>BOWEN MARSH<|>Bowen Marsh reports to Mormont as the Lord Steward<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON<|>PYP<|>Pyp is a friend of Jon who informs him of King Robert's death<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON<|>EDDARD STARK<|>Eddard Stark is Jon's father, imprisoned as a traitor<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MORMONT<|>JORAH<|>Jorah is Mormont's son, who was involved in selling poachers into slavery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MORMONT<|>KING'S LANDING<|>Mormont has contacts in King's Landing to help Eddard Stark<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDDARD STARK<|>PRINCE JOFFREY<|>Eddard Stark is accused of plotting against Prince Joffrey's claim to the throne<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
