Bran exclaims his excitement at being able to ride, and Robb smiles, but Bran\ncan tell something is bothering his brother. Robb notes that something is bothering the direwolves as well before\nadmitting there was a raven the night before. The news recently from the ravens has not been good: \nUncle Benjen\nhas still not been found and \ntheir mother\n has taken \nTyrion Lannister\n captive. Bran remembers Robb sending riders\nwith commands throughout the north. Nobody had told him what was happening, but Bran knew it was about the\nLannisters\n and not good. There is something about the Lannisters that Bran knows he ought to remember, but when\nhe tries to think what it is he becomes dizzy and his stomach clenches.\nRobb explains that the message was from \nAlyn\n in \nKing's Landing\n. \nHeward\n, \nWyl\n, and \nJory Cassel\n have been\nmurdered\n by the \nKingslayer\n. Bran cannot understand why anyone would kill Jory, whom he remembers chasing him\nacross the roofs of \nWinterfell\n. Robb continues solemnly that their \nfather\n’s leg was shattered in the fight and he has\nnot woken since. Robb promises Bran that he “will not let this be forgotten.” Theon advises Robb to call the\nbanners. Bran exclaims that only the Lord can call the banners, but Theon replies that if Eddard dies, Robb is Lord\nof Winterfell. Robb notes to Bran that the honor of \nthe North\n is in his hands. Bran asks if Maester Luwin agrees with\ncalling the banners, and Theon calls the maester as timid as an old woman. Bran tells Robb that their father and\nmother both listen to the maester’s council; Robb states that he listens to everyone.\nThe joy of the ride is over and Bran asks if they can go back because he is cold. Robb states that first they need to\nfind the wolves and the brothers ride into the wolfswood while Theon falls back to talk with a guardsman. Bran\nenjoys riding his horse in the woods while Theon and the guardsmen fall further behind. When they come to a\nstream, Robb asks Bran what is troubling him. Bran admits that he remembers Jory bringing them here to fish with\nJon Snow\n. Bran asks if they will ever see Jon again and Robb reminds him that even Uncle \nBenjen\n came to visit.\n\nThen the wolves howl and Robb rides off to get them, asking Bran to stay there.\nBran is getting anxious about the others when four ragged men and two women surround him. Bran can tell they are\nneither foresters nor farmers and suddenly he remembers how richly he is dressed. The biggest man asks if he is lost\nand Bran says that his guard will be along shortly. Bran, seeing their clothes, believes that the rags could be the\nblack of the \nNight's Watch\n; he remembers that his father said deserters are dangerous because they know their life is\nforfeit.\nThe outlaws demand his silver pin and his horse. When Bran tries to explain that he cannot dismount, they do not\nbelieve him. The big man, whom the others call \nStiv\n, grabs the reins before Bran thinks of turning and riding off.\nFinally, the tall woman, \nOsha\n, sees the straps. The short woman named \nHali\n asks if he is a cripple. Angered, Bran\ndeclares that he is Brandon Stark and that they had better let go of his horse or they will be dead. With Bran’s\narrogant outburst, the gaunt man named \nWallen\n proclaims that only a Stark would threaten when a smarter man\nwould beg. Hali tells the others to cut off his cock and stuff it in his mouth. Osha tells Hali that she is as stupid as\nshe is ugly; \nMance Rayder\n will pay well for a kinsman of \nBenjen Stark\n. Stiv states that he does not want to go back\nto the \nWhite Walkers\n, and cuts the strap on Bran’s saddle, cutting Bran’s leg in the process. Bran feels nothing, but\nstarts to feel light headed.\nSuddenly Robb calls out for them to surrender. Bran sees that Robb is still mounted, with the body of an elk over the\nback of his horse. The outlaws only laugh and point out that it is Robb who is outnumbered and should surrender.\nThen the direwolves appear at Robb’s whistle. Robb charges, killing one of the men and riding down Osha when she\noverextends with her spear. At the same time \nGrey Wind\n kills Wallen and the other unnamed man while Summer\ntears open Hali’s belly.\nNow facing Robb and the direwolves alone, Stiv finishes cutting Bran free, hauls him from the saddle, and holds his\nknife to Bran’s throat. Stiv tells Robb to drop his sword and Robb slowly complies. Then Stiv tells Robb to call the\ndirewolves off, which Robb does. Bran can see that Osha is still alive. Stiv commands Osha to kill the wolves, but\nshe refuses to go anywhere near them. Instead, Stiv orders Robb to kill the wolves. Bran screams “No,” knowing\nthat they will be defenseless without the wolves. Suddenly an arrow from Theon Greyjoy’s bow bursts through\nStiv’s chest and the man collapses into the stream.\nThe Stark guardsmen appear and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
