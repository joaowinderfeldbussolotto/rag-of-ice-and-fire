Dolorous Edd has been entrusted with the commanderâ€™s mount and\ntells Jon that he is to join the commander in the hall, but the wolf should stay outside.\nInside the squalid, foul smelling hall, there are already two dozen rangers, including Jarman Buckwell and Thoren\nSmallwood. Jon thinks how he looked forward to seeing the wonders beyond the wallâ€”it is a pity Pypar and Todder\nare missing this. Craster is the only one sitting in a chair, even the commander has to sit on a bench, and seeing him\nJon thinks of Old \nNan\nâ€™s tales of wildlings drinking blood from human skulls. He overhears Craster say he has not\nseen \nBrandon Stark\n for three years. In the background, shabbily dressed women prepare the food and pass out beer\n\nwhile a dozen puppies and a pig skulk around. Mormont tells Crater that Ben was searching for the vanished Ser\nWaymar Royce\n, \nGared\n and \nWill\n. Craster recalls the three men, but does not know where they went. He does\ncomplain that his wives made cow eyes at young Ser Waymar who was too proud to sleep under his roof. The\ncommander tells him about the villages they found abandoned, and the \nwights\n that attacked him at \nCastle Black\n.\nCraster feigns ignorance, but one of his wives recognizes the truth in the tale by the look of horror on her face.\nCraster also refuses the offer of an escort back to \nthe Wall\n, saying he is of the free folk. He even has his wife\nconfirm that this is their place, Craster keeps them safe, and it is better to die free. Jarmen Buckwell asks about\nCrasterâ€™s king, \nMance Rayder\n, and Craster states that Free Folk have no need of kings, and that when one of\nManceâ€™s men arrived to tell him he had to leave his keep and grovel at Manceâ€™s feet, he sent the man back without\nhis tongue.\nCraster then tells the commander that they can sleep on the floor, but he will only feed 20. Mormont responds that\nthe roof would be welcome, and they have food and wine which they will share. Craster expresses particular interest\nin the wine and then adds that any man that lays a hand on one of his wives loses his hand. Mormont agrees, but\ndoes not look pleased. Craster now asks if Mormont has a man that can draw maps, and Jon steps forward stating\nthat Sam likes maps. Mormont tells Jon to get Sam with quill and parchment and bring Mormontâ€™s axe as a guest\ngift. Craster notes that Jon Snow has the look of a Stark, and is told that he is Mormontâ€™s steward and squire. When\nCraster hears the name Snow, he understands that Jon is a bastard, and declares that a man who wants to bed a\nwoman should marry her like he does, and then tells Jon to do his service.\nJon almost collides into Ottyn Wythers as he is leaving. Outside he finds tents have gone up all over the compound.\nHe finds Dolorous Edd and tells him of the requests. Edd states that the commander will get his axe back, buried in\nhis skull. When he hears that the commander wants wine as well, he says that Craster, drunk, will only cut off an ear\nwhen he attempts to slay them. When Jon tells Dolorous Edd that Smallwood says Craster is their friend, he\nresponds the difference between wildling friends and enemies is that the friends bury them in secret graves.\nJon hears a shout of fear as he finishes up feeding the horses. He finds Ghost with two rabbits confronting a 15 year\nold girl. Jon promises that Ghost will not hurt her. He asks her if she is one of Crasterâ€™s daughters and is told she is\nnow his wife. She was hoping to breed the rabbits. Jon can tell that Ghost has gone after the caged rabbits; he must\nhave been hungry. He would pay for them but has no money, so he tells her that the \nNight's Watch\n will make good.\nShe calls him lord and he responds he is no lord. Then ranger \nLark\n the Sisterman tells her that he is Lord Snow\nhimself, and then notes that the wolf is looking hungry. Jon tells Lark that he is scaring her, only to have Chett\nrespond that Lark is warning her. The girl then remembers she is not to talk to them. Chett tells Jon that he would\nnot be so bold without Ghost around; Chett lost is position as Maester \nAemon\n's steward because of Jon. When Lark\njoins in about Jon being a coward without his wolf, he leaves.\nIt takes a while for Jon to find Sam, and it is actually Ghost that finds him under a rock outcrop. Ghost has given Jon\nthe second rabbit, and Jon shows Sam and then informs him that the commander wants him to create a map. Jon\nproceeds to cook the scrawny rabbit over a fire. It smells wonderful and the other rangers give them envious looks.\nAs they eat, Sam asks if Craster is a savage, as they say. After Sam leaves with the quill and parchment, Jon falls\nasleep thinking that maybe the commander will learn something that will lead them to Uncle Benjen.\nHe wakes to dawn, and Ghost is gone. Everything is coated in a fine ice glaze, and Jon thinks of his sisters, and that\nSansa\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization of rangers and soldiers guarding the realm beyond the Wall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTLE BLACK<|>GEO<|>A fortress and headquarters of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE WALL<|>GEO<|>A massive barrier of ice and magic separating the Seven Kingdoms from the lands beyond)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRATER<|>PERSON<|>A wildling leader who lives beyond the Wall and interacts with the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON SNOW<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch and steward to Commander Mormont)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMANDER MORMONT<|>PERSON<|>The leader of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARMAN BUCKWELL<|>PERSON<|>A ranger of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOREN SMALLWOOD<|>PERSON<|>A ranger of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDON STARK<|>PERSON<|>A missing person mentioned by Craster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER WAYMAR ROYCE<|>PERSON<|>A missing ranger of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARED<|>PERSON<|>A missing ranger of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILL<|>PERSON<|>A missing ranger of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANCE RAYDER<|>PERSON<|>A wildling leader and self-proclaimed king beyond the Wall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAM<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch who likes maps)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OTTYN WYTHERS<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOLOROUS EDD<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch known for his pessimistic outlook)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARK THE SISTERMAN<|>PERSON<|>A ranger of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHETT<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Night's Watch with a grudge against Jon Snow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>PERSON<|>An elderly maester serving the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>Jon Snow's sister)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENJEN STARK<|>PERSON<|>Jon Snow's uncle and a member of the Night's Watch)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Jon Snow is a member of the Night's Watch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMANDER MORMONT<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Commander Mormont is the leader of the Night's Watch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JARMAN BUCKWELL<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Jarman Buckwell is a ranger of the Night's Watch<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOREN SMALLWOOD<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Thoren Smallwood is a ranger of the Night's Watch<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRATER<|>THE WALL<|>Craster lives beyond the Wall and interacts with the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>COMMANDER MORMONT<|>Jon Snow is the steward and squire to Commander Mormont<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER WAYMAR ROYCE<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Ser Waymar Royce was a missing ranger of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GARED<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Gared was a missing ranger of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILL<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Will was a missing ranger of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANCE RAYDER<|>CRATER<|>Mance Rayder is a wildling leader who Craster refuses to acknowledge as king<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAM<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Sam is a member of the Night's Watch who likes maps<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OTTYN WYTHERS<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Ottyn Wythers is a member of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOLOROUS EDD<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Dolorous Edd is a member of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARK THE SISTERMAN<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Lark the Sisterman is a ranger of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHETT<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Chett is a member of the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER AEMON<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Maester Aemon is an elderly maester serving the Night's Watch<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>BENJEN STARK<|>Jon Snow is searching for his uncle Benjen Stark<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON SNOW<|>SANSA<|>Sansa is Jon Snow's sister<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
