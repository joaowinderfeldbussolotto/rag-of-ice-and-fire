When questioned\nwhy he did not wake him, Pylos blushes and states he was told to let Cressen rest and that Cressen was not needed\nhere. Cressen looks at the gaudy knights and captains: aged and sour Lord \nArdrian Celtigar\n, handsome Lord\nMonford Velaryon\n, plump 14-year-old Lord \nDuram Bar Emmon\n, homely Ser \nAxell Florent\n, pious Lord \nGuncer\nSunglass\n, and the Lysene captain \nSalladhor Saan\n. Only Ser Davos Seaworth is simply dressed. Melisandre sits to\nStannis’ right, in the place of high honor. Of all the lords, only Davos will meet his gaze, with pity in his eyes.\nStannis declares that Pylos will now assume all of Cressen's duties, insisting that Cressen is too ill and confused to\nbe of use to him any longer. Cressen cannot believe it is Stannis’s voice that states this. Cressen is heartbroken by\nthe rejection, remembering how he was the one that loved Stannis as a boy, perhaps because Stannis was the one\nwho was unloved. Cressen accepts and meekly pleads for some place at the table, though he still feels he belongs at\nStannis’ side. Of all the assembled lords, only Ser Davos offers him a seat.\nAs Patchface continues to caper about, Ser Davos comments that they should wear motley, since they are about\nfool’s business: Melisandre has seen victory in her flames and so Stannis plans to press his claim, no matter the\nnumbers. Cressen urges Stannis a final time to ally himself with Robb Stark or Lysa Arryn, but Queen Selyse insists\nthat R’hllor is the only ally Stannis needs. Cressen replies that gods make uncertain allies, and here R'hllor has no\npower. Melisandre tells him that if he believes that he should put Patchface’s crown back on, and Queen Selyse\ncommands thus. Stannis grudgingly orders the fool to give the crown to Cressen. After the fool places the crown on\nCressen’s head, Selyse suggests that Cressen sing. Stannis refuses and declares that Cressen has served him well.\nSuddenly, Cressen sees the opportunity to poison Melisandre. He is close to Davos’ cup, which he takes and slips a\ncrystal into. He is sure only Davos notices. Cressen proposes to Melisandre that they share a cup of wine to toast to\nher god’s power. She agrees. Davos tries to stop him, but Cressen insists he is doing what he must for the sake of the\nrealm and his lord’s soul. Before they drink, Melisandre gives him the opportunity to back out, but Cressen refuses.\nMelisandre drinks most of the cup, leaving only a small amount for Cressen. Cressen pushes away his fear and\ndrinks as well. The ruby at Melisandre’s throat glows as she insists that her god R’hllor does have power. Cressen\ntries to reply, but his throat has already begun to constrict. Unaffected by the poison, Melisandre looks on with pity\nas Cressen collapses and dies.\nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nArya I\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 1: Arya I\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n - The \nKingsroad\n north of \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya V\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nPrologue\n ←\nArya I\n→ \nSansa I\n↓\nArya II\nArya Stark\n is travelling north with \nYoren\n of the \nNight's Watch\n, disguised as a boy. When the orphan boy known as\nHot Pie\n tries to steal her sword “\nNeedle\n,” Arya beats him bloody. Yoren takes her aside for punishment and reveals\nthat \nher father\n was supposed to be allowed to take the black, rather than be executed.\nSynopsis\nArya used to think her nickname of “Arya Horseface” was bad, until the orphan boy \nLommy Greenhands\n named her\n“Lumpyhead” because of her lumpy, uneven haircut. Her head actually feels lumpy when she touches it.\nWhen \nYoren\n dragged her into an alley after \nher father\n’s \nexecution\n, Arya was sure he meant to kill her. Instead, the\nsmelly old \nblack brother\n had only cut her hair and promised to deliver her to her home at \nWinterfell\n when he and his\nnew recruits pass by. However, Yoren insisted that she pretend to be an orphan boy named Arry because half of the\nnew recruits would turn her over to Queen \nCersei\n quick as spit for a pardon and a few silvers, and the other half\nwould do the same but rape her first. Yoren claimed it should not be too hard to pass as a boy; the hardest part would\nbe passing her water in the woods alone.\nThere are 30 of them; some of the recruits are orphan boys recruited with promises of food and clothing, but others\nare criminals from the dungeons under the \nRed Keep\n. The most frightening are the three from the \nblack cells\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d18939d7af9beeac2afc419e46639d27d313c74ed86cbebb6b23c763c0ad704d_v2"}
