His\nsons \nAllard\n and \nDale\n agree that it is an ill thing to burn the gods, but Davos cautions them that this is not the place.\nThe red priestess \nMelisandre\n walks around the fire, praying in three tongues for \nR'hllor\n, the Lord of Light, to accept\nthese false gods of the enemy and cast light upon them. The prayer ends with the sacred refrain, \"For the night is\ndark and full of terrors.\" Queen \nSelyse\n echoes the words, but King \nStannis\n only watches impassively.\nDragonstone's sept was where \nAegon I Targaryen\n knelt to pray before he embarked upon his \nconquest\n, but that did\nnot save it from the queen's men. They overturned the altars, pulled down the statues, and smashed the stained glass.\nDavos recalls that the statues were originally carved from the masts of the ships that carried the first \nTargaryens\nfrom \nValyria\n. \nSepton\n \nBarre\n could only curse them, but Ser \nHubard Rambton\n and his three sons slew four men before\nthey were overwhelmed. Afterward, pious Lord \nGuncer Sunglass\n withdrew his support for Stannis and was\nimprisoned along with the septon and Ser Hubard's two surviving sons.\nThough he has never been devout, the burning gods make Davos feel ill. Lord \nArdrian Celtigar\n coughs from the\nsmoke and Lord \nDuram Bar Emmon\n turns grey, but Lord \nMonford Velaryon\n watches Stannis rather than the fire.\nDavos wonders what Velaryon is thinking, but knows such a proud lord will never confide in him. The lords all\nscorn Davos and his sons, but one day their grandsons will joust together. In time Davos imagines his sigil will fly\nas high as theirs, but only if Stannis wins his throne, since everything Davos is he owes to Stannis. It was Stannis\nwho gave Davos his knighthood and his war galley \nBlack Betha\n. His sons Dale and Allard captain ships of their\nown, \nMaric\n is oarmaster on the \nFury\n, \nMatthos\n serves as Davos' mate, \nDevan\n is a royal squire who will one day be a\nknight, and his two \nyoungest\n \nsons\n will one day be knights as well. His wife \nMarya\n is mistress of a small keep, and\nDavos can hunt deer in his own woods. All this he has of Stannis for the price of a few finger joints, taken as just\npunishment for flaunting the law all his life. As he thinks back, Davos touches the pouch around his neck where he\nkeeps his finger bones for luck; they will all need luck soon.\nMelisandre recounts an ancient prophecy that at the end of a long summer, when the stars bleed and darkness falls\nover world, \nAzor Ahai\n will be reborn and draw the burning sword \nLightbringer\n from the fire and destroy the\ndarkness. Then she calls upon Azor Ahai to claim his sword and Stannis marches forward. His squires, Devan\nSeaworth and \nBryen Farring\n, equip him with a padded glove and leather cape. Using the cape to ward off the flames,\nStannis plunges into the fire and draws out a near-molten sword from the statue of the \nMother\n. Queen Selyse and her\nqueen's men chant praises, and Melisandre names the sword Lightbringer and declares Stannis Azor Ahai come\nagain. The cherry-red sword is burning his glove, so Stannis thrusts it into the dirt.\nMelisandre calls upon R'hllor to cast light upon them, and Selyse and the queen's men reply that the night is dark\nand full of terrors. Then Melisandre sings a song in the \nAsshai\n'i language until only charwood remains of the gods.\nImpatient, Stannis escorts his queen back into Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer in the dirt for his squires to collect.\n\nDavos notes that the burnt and blackened Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess. A few lords linger, speaking\nquietly, but they fall silent when they see Davos looking at them. Davos knows that these lords will pull him down if\nStannis should fall, but neither will he court the favor of Queen Selyse by giving himself to this new Lord of Light.\nWhen the fire starts to dwindle, Melisandre and the squires depart with the sword, and Davos and his sons join the\ncrowd headed for the harbor. Davos comments that Devan did well as the king's squire. Allard asks why the king's\nsquires wore \nfiery heart\n sigils in place of the \ncrowned stag\n. Davos points out that a lord can choose more than one\nbadge. Allard insists that it was an ill thing to burn the Seven. Davos asks when Allard grew so devout and what a\nsmuggler's son would know of the gods' doings. Allard insists he is a knight's son and asks why the lords should\nremember Davos is a knight if he does not himself. Davos points out that Allard will never be a knight if he meddles\nin\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DAVOS SEAWORTH<|>PERSON<|>Davos Seaworth is a knight and former smuggler who serves King Stannis Baratheon.
