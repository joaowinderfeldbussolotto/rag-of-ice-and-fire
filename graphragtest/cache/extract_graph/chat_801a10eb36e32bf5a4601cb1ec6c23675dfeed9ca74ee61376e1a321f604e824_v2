He wonders whether \nCersei\n will be true to her promise of protecting \nAlayaya\nthe way he protects Cersei's wretched bastard son.\nTyrion gets word that hundreds of enemies have landed on the tourney grounds and prepare for battering down the\nKing's Gate\n with a ram. He curses, hurries to his horse and, followed by \nPodrick Payne\n and Ser \nMandon Moore\n,\ngallops through the \nRiver Row\n, kept clear of traffic on Tyrion's command to allow movement between the gates,\ntowards the King's Gate. When he arrives there, the ram is already in place outside and crashing against the wood.\nSome of the defenders on the gatehouse square are wounded, but Tyrion spots a good many sellswords and knights\nwho are not, and he orders another sortie, asking who is in charge.\nSandor Clegane\n steps forward and objects to Tyrion's order, dropping his helmet to the ground. His face is covered\nin blood from a gash on his forehead and his left ear is sheared off. Tyrion insists on a sortie, but the Hound tells\nhim to bugger that and bugger himself. A sellsword seconds Clegane, explaining that three sorties left half of the\nmen wounded or dead. Tyrion sarcastically asks him whether he thinks he has been hired to fight in a tourney. He\nrepeats his order, addressing the Hound in particular, but then is shocked to notice that Clegane is actually scared.\nHe changes his tactics and tries to coax the men into action, but Clegane is adamant that he will not lead the men\ninto the fire again. He suggests to open the gate instead and kill the enemies when they rush inside. Ser Mandon\nadvises him to obey the order of the \nHand of the King\n, but the Hound just curses Tyrion some more, then asks for\nwine.\nClegane's face is white as milk and Tyrion thinks he's dead on feet, worn out by the battle and his terror of fire. Even\nworse, the Hound's fear has shaken the will of those he commands. Tyrion is looking around for another man to put\nin charge, but dimisses his own idea of using Ser Mandon, as he remembers a comment by his brother \nJaime\n that Ser\nMandon is not the kind of man others would follow. He hears another crash of the ram and announces that he will\nlead the sortie himself, thinking to himself that this is madness but madness is better than defeat. The Hound laughs\nat the suggestion with contempt, but Tyrion gives orders to prepare the attack. However, only twenty men respond to\nhis call while the others follow Clegane's example. Sitting on his horse with helmet and shield, Tyrion addresses the\nholdouts: \"They say I'm only half a man. What does that make the lot of you?\"\nHe manages to shame them by suggesting they are less than a dwarf if they refuse to fight the enemies. Within a few\nmoments, twice as many men respond to Tyrion's orders. He announces:\n\"You won’t hear me shout out Joffrey’s name. [...] You won’t hear me yell for \nCasterly Rock\n either. This is\nyour city Stannis means to sack, and that’s your gate he’s bringing down. So come with me and kill the son of a\nbitch!\"\nTyrion unshields his axe and trots towards the sally point. He thinks the men are following him, but he doesn't dare\nto look around and check whether they really do.\nNavigation:\nTyrion XII\n↑\nDavos III\n ←\nTyrion XIII\n→ \nSansa VI\n↓\nTyrion XIV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 60: Sansa V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VI\n↑\nTyrion XIII\n ←\nSansa V\n→ \nTyrion XIV\n↓\nSansa VII\nSynopsis\nCersei\n continues to receive word on the progress of \nthe battle\n from one of the \nKettleblacks\n.
