Daenerys finds this curious and wonders if the knight plans to visit\na brothel afterwards. Daenerys wanders joyfully around for half of the morning, even laughing for the first time\nsince her brother’s death. As per Dothraki custom she receives several items as gifts and reciprocates with\nmedallions from her belt.\nTurning a corner, they come upon a wine merchant offering thimbles of wines. Daenerys accepts a taste of the wine,\n\nspeaking in Valyrian, which surprises the merchant, until \nDoreah\n steps up to declare all of Daenerys’ titles. The\nmerchant immediately insists that the wine he was going to offer her is not worthy of a princess and offers her a cask\nof his finest wine. Daenerys graciously accepts the cask, knowing that Drogo has acquired a taste for fine wine from\nhis time in the Free Cities.\nAs Daenerys is ordering the cask taken back to the litter, Ser Jorah appears and states he wants a taste of the wine.\nThe wine merchant resists, insisting that Ser Jorah is not fit for such wine, but relents and pours two cups when Ser\nJorah threatens him. Then Ser Jorah orders the merchant to drink. Instead, the merchant throws the cask at Daenerys\nand flees. Ser Jorah pushes Daenerys out of the way and Doreah just barely catches her before she falls on her\npregnant belly. \nJhogo\n uses his whip to trip the merchant. The ruckus brings a dozen caravan guards and the\nmerchant captain running. The merchant captain seems to guess what has happened. He orders the merchant taken\naway to await Khal Drogo and gives the merchant’s goods to Daenerys as a gift. Daenerys asks Ser Jorah how he\nknew but the knight insists that he only suspected because the letter from Magister Illyrio had made him fearful. As\nthey return, Daenerys notes that her baby is moving restlessly and she comforts him with words about being the\nblood of the dragon.\nWhen they get back to the hollow hummock that serves as her home, Daenerys orders the rest to leave her with Ser\nJorah. The knight explains that the letter from Magister Illyrio brings news that \nthe Usurper\n has offered lands and a\nlordship to anyone that kills Daenerys and her child or her brother. Daenerys observes, with a laughing sob, that the\nUsurper owes Drogo a lordship for killing Viserys.\nDaenerys then thinks that the Usurper has woken her dragon and looks over to her dragon eggs. She commands Ser\nJorah to light the brazier despite the heat and then asks him to leave. She then pushes the eggs under the coals,\nwondering if she is destroying the eggs. Nothing happens and Daenerys is very disappointed, but wonders even to\nherself what she was expecting.\nDrogo returns with the carcass of a \nhrakkar\n as the stars come out. After he has told her that he will make her a cloak\nof its skin, Daenerys tells him what has happened. Drogo becomes very quiet as Ser Jorah tells him that this will not\nbe the last attempt. For their roles in saving his \nkhaleesi\n, Drogo gives Ser Jorah and Jhogo their choice of his horses.\nDrogo also proclaims a gift for his unborn son, \nRhaego\n: the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Drogo then swears to the\nMother of Mountains that he will take his \nkhalasar\n west and ride the wooden horses to Westeros to kill the men in\nthe iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He vows to rape their women, take their children as slaves, and to\nbring their broken gods back to \nVaes Dothrak\n to bow beneath the Mother of Mountains.\nTwo days later, the \nkhalasar\n leaves Vaes Dothrak, headed southwest. The wine seller is forced to run naked, chained\nbehind Daenerys’ silver.
