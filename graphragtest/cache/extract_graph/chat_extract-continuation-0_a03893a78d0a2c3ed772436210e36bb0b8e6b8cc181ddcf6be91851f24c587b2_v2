Allard insists that it was an ill thing to burn the Seven. Davos asks when Allard grew so devout and what a\nsmuggler's son would know of the gods' doings. Allard insists he is a knight's son and asks why the lords should\nremember Davos is a knight if he does not himself. Davos points out that Allard will never be a knight if he meddles\nin affairs that do not concern him; it is not for them to question their rightful king. His sons do not like to recall they\nwere lowborn, and when they look at \nHouse Seaworth\n's sigil they see only the black ship and close their eyes to the\nonion.\nIn the extremely crowded port, Davos enters an inn, where he finds the flamboyant \nLysene\n pirate \nSalladhor Saan\neating grapes. A friend and business partner from his smuggling days, it was Davos who recruited Saan to Stannis'\ncause. When Davos asks why he did not attend the burning, Salladhor explains that such sights are common in Lys.\nThey bore him, and hopefully they will soon bore Stannis.\nSalladhor explains that one of his \ntrading ships\n arrived from \nKing's Landing\n with news that \nTyrion Lannister\n is now\noverseeing the capital and has driven out \nJanos Slynt\n as commander of the \nCity Watch\n. Davos asks how well the city\nis defended. Saan replies that the walls are strong, but defended only by the gold cloaks, who are too few and\ninexperienced. He urges a swift strike to take the city, and then Tyrion could be dressed as a fool and Queen \nCersei\ncould warm his bed for a night as part of his payment. Davos assures Salladhor he will be paid, but the pirate insists\nhe wants gold, not words. Davos promises there is gold in the treasury at King's Landing, and Stannis is the most\nhonorable man in the \nSeven Kingdoms\n.\nSalladhor again urges an attack on the capital, but Davos asks how long they could hold it with \nTywin Lannister\n and\nRenly Baratheon\n against them. Saan reveals Renly has left \nHighgarden\n with his army and his \nnew queen\n to march\non King's Landing. That Renly brought his bride along surprises Davos; it suggests either great love or great\nconfidence. Davos declares that Stannis must be told, but Salladhor has already done so, though Stannis seems to\ndisapprove of the pirate.\nAbruptly, Salladhor claims Stannis' sword is not the true Lightbringer and asks how a burnt sword will serve\nStannis. Davos corrects that it is a \nburning\n sword, but Saan insists it is burnt. He recounts the legend of how, after\ntwo failed attempts, Azor Ahai labored a hundred days and nights on a hero's blade to oppose darkness. Then he\ntempered the sword in his wife \nNissa Nissa\n's heart and her blood, soul, courage, and strength went into the steel to\ncreate Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes. Salladhor tells Davos to be thankful the sword Stannis raised is not\nreal because, \"Too much light can hurt the eyes, and fire burns.\"\nSalladhor asks when Stannis will sail, and Davos replies that it depends on the will of the king's new god. Salladhor\nasks who Davos' god is. Cautious of his surroundings, Davos replies that his god is King Stannis, who made him and\nblessed him with trust. Salladhor says he will remember and excuses himself, declaring they will soon feast in the\nRed Keep. He also asks Davos to remind Stannis he will owe another 30,000 dragons come the black of the moon,\ncommenting that the statues they burnt might have brought a noble price. He jokes that if Stannis grants him Queen\nCersei for a night he shall forgive him.\nDavos lingers in the inn, thinking of Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword, though there was no true magic in that\nsword. A true sword of fire would be a wonder, but when he thinks of Nissa Nissa it is his own wife Marya he\npictures, and he decides the price is more than he cares to pay.\nAfter dark, Devan arrives with a summons from King Stannis. When Davos arrives, the important bannermen are\nleaving. Ser \nAxell Florent\n, the foremost of the queen's men, asks what Davos thought of the burning gods and\nexplains he saw a vision of the glory awaiting Stannis when they take King's Landing. Davos replies that all he saw\nwas fire and pushes past, wondering why Ser Axell bothered, since Davos is the king's man as much as Axell is the\nqueen's.\n\nDavos finds Stannis seated at the Painted Table with \nMaester\n \nPylos\n. Stannis commands Davos to have a look at his\nletter. Davos obediently selects a paper before pointing out that he is illiterate. Mildly irritated, Stannis commands\nMaester Pylos to read the letter instead:\nAll men know me for the trueborn son of \nSteffon Baratheon\n, Lord of Storm’s End, by his lady wife \nCassana\n of\nHouse Estermont\n.
