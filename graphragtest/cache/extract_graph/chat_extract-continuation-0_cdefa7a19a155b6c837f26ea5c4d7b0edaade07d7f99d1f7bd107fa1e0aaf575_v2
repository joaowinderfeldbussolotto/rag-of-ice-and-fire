When she replies \"no one\", he tells her that she lies, trying to get\nher to forget her true self and give up her past, but Arya resists. She works hard in the temple, cleaning and doing\nother chores. She witnesses many people entering the temple, some to light candles, others to curl up near a statue to\ndie, and others to speak in private to the kindly man. When asked whose names she whispers at night, she finally\nadmits that they are people she wants to kill, but the priest tells her that it is the \nMany-Faced God\n who determines\nwho shall die, not her. He also finally convinces her to dispose of her possessions, and she does so with all but\nNeedle\n, which she hides outside the temple under a stone. Once she has done this, the kindly man comes to her and\ntells her some of their history.\nThe \nFaceless Men\n are older than \nBraavos\n, having started amongst the slaves working the mines beneath the\nvolcanoes of the \nValyrian Freehold\n. The slaves worked under the harshest of conditions, and since they came from\nmany different nations, they all prayed to different gods. But one amongst them (although he may have actually\nbeen a noble's son or an overseer, no one knows) realized that they were actually all praying to one god- one who\ncould set them free from their torture.\nThe kindly man does not finish the story, but now Arya is a novice at the temple, and she and the \nwaif\n begin to teach\neach other their respective languages. As Arya learns Braavosi, the waif also teaches her how to read a lie on\nsomeone's face, and Arya discovers that the girl is actually well over thirty years old, having taken \"poisons\" as part\nof her sacrifice to become Faceless. One day, when other priests of the Many-Faced God visit the temple, Arya asks\nthe kindly man how to change her face, as \nJaqen H'ghar\n did. While the priest knows not the name, he tells her it\ntakes years of prayer, sacrifice and study to accomplish what he could do. Still, Arya wishes to learn, so he tells her\nto begin training the muscles of her face in front of a mirror every day. The next day, the kindly man tells Arya that\nshe must leave the temple for a while, so as to learn the Braavosi tongue by being amongst them all the time. He\ninstructs her to find a fishmonger named \nBrusco\n, but to not reveal who she really is. Arya decides to use the name\n\"Cat\", pretending to be an orphan girl from \nKing's Landing\n.\nNavigation:\nArya I\n↑\nChapter 21\n ←\nArya II\n→ \nAlayne I\n↓\nCat of the Canals\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 23: Alayne I\nPlace(s): \nthe \nEyrie\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa I\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nAlayne I\n→ \nCersei V\n↓\nAlayne II\nSynopsis\nSansa\n is now completely in the role of \nAlayne Stone\n, and she has considerable influence in the \nEyrie\n. On the\nbalcony of her rooms in the \nMaiden's Tower\n, she surveys the armies of the \nLords Declarant\n camped outside the\nGates of the Moon\n. Lord \nGilwood Hunter\n arrived first, and immediately blockaded supplies from reaching the Eyrie.\nThough they are not yet under siege, the situation looks dire from her standpoint. Lord \nRobert\n, even more irritable\nthan normal because there are no eggs or bacon, tells Alayne that he still hears \nMarillion\n singing every night. Alayne\nassures him that the bard is dead, although she has not seen the body, but she herself no longer hears singing. When\nLittlefinger\n arrives, he informs them that the Lords Declarant are on their way up to the Eyrie for a parley. He tells\nAlayne that there will be eight of them, but he is only concerned about \nLyn Corbray\n. We learn that Lyn fought\nagainst \nJon Arryn\n at \nGulltown\n at the onset of \nRobert's Rebellion\n, but later fought alongside him at the \nTrident\n, where\nhe slew Prince \nLewyn Martell\n of the \nKingsguard\n and broke the Dornish line. While his \nelder brother\n supports Petyr's\nposition as Lord Protector of the Vale, Ser Lyn has taken up with the Lords Declarant. Bearing the Valyrian sword\nLady Forlorn\n, Ser Lyn is a dangerous and unpredictable man, quick to demand a duel.\nThe Lords Declarant seek to defend Lord Robert and the Vale, but do not acknowledge
