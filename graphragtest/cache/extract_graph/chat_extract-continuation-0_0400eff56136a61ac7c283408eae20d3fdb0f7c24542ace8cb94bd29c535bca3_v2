Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n is named a member of Joffrey’s \nKingsguard\n, and \nMargaery\n is betrothed to\nJoffrey. With this, Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey is ended, to her great relief. \nMace Tyrell\n is named to the King’s \nsmall\ncouncil\n.\nMany of the great lords sworn to \nCasterly Rock\n and \nHighgarden\n receive honors, and many hedge knights and\nfreeriders as well. \nLothor Brune\n is knighted, and called Apple-Eater for defeating several \nFossoways\n; \nPhilip Foote\n is\ngranted the lands of Lord \nBryce Caron\n and elevated to lord. \nHallyne\n the Pyromancer is named lord, but given no\nlands, and \nLancel\n is named lord and given the land of the \nDarrys\n, except he may die or lose his arm from the wounds\nhe suffered. \nLittlefinger\n is granted \nHarrenhal\n and named \nLord Paramount of the Trident\n for negotiating the treaty\nwhich brought the \nTyrells\n to the aid of \nKing's Landing\n.\nWhen the captives are brought in, many swear fealty to Joffrey, but several are killed for openly ridiculing the King\nand refusing to bend the knee. Later that night, Sansa goes to the \ngodswood\n and meets \nDontos Hollard\n, who is sad\nbecause the \nQueen\n still has plans for Sansa, and her escape will be impossible while the Queen is watching.\nHowever, Dontos does reveal that they will escape during Joffrey’s wedding in about a month. Dontos then gives\nher a hair net that resembles a silver spiderweb with amethysts in it. He tells her to wear it, for \"It’s magic, you see.\nIt’s justice you hold. It’s vengeance for \nyour father\n. It’s home.\"\nNavigation:\nSansa VII\n↑\nArya X\n ←\nSansa VIII\n→ \nTheon VI\n↓\nA Storm of Swords\nSansa I\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 66: Theon VI\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nTheon V\n↑\nSansa VIII\n ←\nTheon VI\n→ \nTyrion XV\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nReek I\nAs \nWinterfell\n is being besieged, \nTheon Greyjoy\n declines Maester \nLuwin\n's suggestion of yielding. Theon parleys\nwith Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, using Rodrik's daughter \nBeth\n as a hostage. Theon knows that the host will attack regardless\nof his threat of Beth and considers Luwin's suggestion of requesting \ntaking the black\n until he is informed that the\nnorthmen are \nfighting among each other\n. Newly arrived \nmen from the Dreadfort\n slaughter Rodrik's host, and Theon\nis shocked to discover that they are being led by \"Reek\", who reveals himself to be \nRamsay Bolton\n. Ramsay knocks\nTheon to the ground and orders \nWinterfell to be sacked\n.\nSynopsis\nTheon Greyjoy\n is approached by Maester \nLuwin\n, who advices him to yield. \nVictarion\n and \nBalon Greyjoy\n have not\nreplied to Theon's messages, and although new birds will not reach them on time, Theon orders Luwin to send them\nanyway. He accuses Luwin of wanting him dead. The maester calmly explains that, although he bears Theon no\ngreat love, his \norder\n] serves and the fact that Theon holds Winterfell means that Luwin is bound to serve him. Again,\nhe counsels Theon to yield \nWinterfell\n, as he has no hope of holding it. Theon counters that by holding onto\nWinterfell, \nRodrik Cassel\n cannot turn south to take Victarion in the rear. He is willing to withstand a siege of a year,\nbut Luwin tells him that within days the northmen will be climbing the walls in more places than Theon can stop\nthem.\nTheon has his \nironborn\n assemble in the yard. He informs his men he will not run from the northmen, and gives them\nthe option of leaving him or dying beside him. None of his men reply, until \nWex Pyke\n steps over to Theon's side.\nLorren\n, \nRed Rolfe\n, \nKromm\n, \nWerlag\n, \nTymor\n and his three brothers, \nUlf the Ill\n, \nHarrag Sharp\n, four \nHarlaws\n and two\nBotleys\n, and \nKenned\n the Whale follow.
