By rights, those jars should be destroyed, but so many of\nthe guild's masters were killed during the \nSack of King's Landing\n that they lack the skill and have flooded the vaults\ninstead. Hallyne adds that the \nwhereabouts\n of much of King Aerys's stock was also lost, such as a cache of two\nhundred jars discovered only last year under the \nGreat Sept of Baelor\n. Hallyne admits this older stock can still be\nused, but urges extreme caution, since wildfire grows more volatile with age and will self-ignite if left in even direct\nsunlight for too long, causing it to expand violently and create a chain reaction among nearby jars.\nWhen Tyrion asks how many jars they have, Hallyne quotes the morning's count by Wisdom \nMunciter\n as 7,840 jars,\nincluding 4,000 from King Aerys' older stock and says he is confident the guild will meet its promise of 10,000 jars.\nTyrion is astonished, delighted, and terrified. He knows creating wildfire is a lengthy and dangerous process, and\nthought the number was only a wild boast. He insists he does not want any undue haste or defective wildfire, but\nHallyne assures him the wildfire is prepared only by trained acolytes in work cells designed to fill with sand and\nsmother any fires―and the hapless acolyte. Tyrion is interested in inspecting how such a cell would work, but he\ndoes not have time.\nHallyne reiterates the importance of handling wildfire with care, suggesting that common soldiers in the frenzy of\nbattle may not be as considerate as trained pyromancers, and any little mistake could be catastrophic. In response,\n\nTyrion requests as many spare jars as possible to be delivered to each of the city gates.\nAs they walk back, Hallyne stresses the honor of welcoming the \nHand of the King\n for the first time since Lord\nRossart\n, who was of their guild himself. The mention of Rossart reminds Tyrion of the stories of Mad King Aerys II\nusing the alchemists to burn his enemies, and he decides it would be best to keep \nJoffrey\n well away from the\npyromancers to prevent him getting the same idea. As such, when Hallyne proposes hosting a feast for Joffrey,\nTyrion explains that Joffrey has forbidden feasting (at Tyrion's insistence) until the war is won. However, Tyrion has\nno objections when Hallyne instead proposes a demonstration of the \"dread secrets\" of his ancient order at the \nRed\nKeep\n; there is no harm in a few magic tricks.\nAfter navigating the twists and turns of the Guildhall, they come to the long and echoing Gallery of the Iron\nTorches, where columns of wildfire flames burn around black metal columns and reflect off the black marble walls\nto bathe the hall in emerald light. However, Tyrion is less impressed because he knows the cost of wildfire means\nthe torches have been lit only to impress him.\nAfter bidding farewell to Hallyne on the doorstep, Tyrion descends the broad steps to the Street of Sisters near\nVisenya's hill\n where Timett waits with his litter and an escort of \nBurned Men\n, a most appropriate escort for a visit to\nthe pyromancers and a necessary precaution since Joffrey rained arrows on a hungry mob at the gates of the Red\nKeep only three days past. Tyrion is surprised to find \nBronn\n waiting as well, with two messages: Ser \nJacelyn\nBywater\n urgently requires Tyrion at the \nGate of the Gods\n and Cersei commands him to attend her in her chambers.\nTyrion decides to see Bywater first, as the man is not prone to waste his time and forcing Cersei to wait will make\nher angry and stupid, which he prefers to composed and cunning.\nThe normally-busy food market inside the Gate of the Gods is nearly deserted as Tyrion crosses it to meet Ser\nJacelyn, who informs him that Ser \nCleos Frey\n has arrived with peace terms from \nRobb Stark\n. Tyrion is pleased, but\nCleos proves reluctant to discuss the terms since his orders are to deliver them directly to Cersei. Gaunt and haggard\nfrom his journey, Cleos describes the dire situation around the \nGods Eye\n and the \nkingsroad\n, where the river lords are\nburning their own crops to starve the Lannisters, who are in turn torching every village and killing the smallfolk.\nTyrion dismisses this as the way of war while Cleos adds that even with a peace banner his party was attacked twice\nby \nbroken men\n, losing three men and another six wounded.\nWhen Tyrion is amused by Robb's impossible peace terms, Cleos shares that Robb sits idle at \nRiverrun\n, likely afraid\nto face Lord \nTywin\n in battle, and grows weaker as the river lords disperse to defend their lands. Tyrion wonders if\nthat was his father's plan, then informs Cleos that the terms―including the exchange of \nWillem Lannister\n and Cleos'\nbrother \nTion Frey\n for \nSansa\n and \nArya Stark\n―are unacceptable, and Cleos will be expected to carry the \nsmall\ncouncil\n's counteroffer\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KING AERYS
