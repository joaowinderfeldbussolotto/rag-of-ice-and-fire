Stannis commands Davos to have a look at his\nletter. Davos obediently selects a paper before pointing out that he is illiterate. Mildly irritated, Stannis commands\nMaester Pylos to read the letter instead:\nAll men know me for the trueborn son of \nSteffon Baratheon\n, Lord of Storm’s End, by his lady wife \nCassana\n of\nHouse Estermont\n. I declare upon the honor of my House that my beloved brother \nRobert\n, our late king, left no\ntrueborn issue of his body, the boy \nJoffrey\n, the boy \nTommen\n, and the girl \nMyrcella\n being abominations born of\nincest between \nCersei Lannister\n and her brother \nJaime\n the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day\nlay claim to the \nIron Throne\n of the Seven Kingdoms of \nWesteros\n. Let all true men declare their loyalty. Done in\nthe Light of the Lord, under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the\nAndals, the \nRhoynar\n, and the \nFirst Men\n, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\nStannis orders Pylos to add \"Ser\" to Jaime's name since he is still a knight, and to remove \"beloved brother\" since it\nis a lie. Then he declares all of their 117 ravens will be used to carry copies across the realm, though most will likely\nbe burnt by lords who support the other kings even though Stannis is their rightful king. Therefore, Stannis orders\nDavos to sail north as far as \nWhite Harbor\n while his son Dale sails south as far as \nthe Arbor\n. They are to post the\ndeclaration in every port and fishing village they pass for every man who can to read. Davos points out that few\nsmallfolk can read and requests knights to read the declarations aloud. Stannis agrees, since he has a hundred\nknights who would rather read than fight. He plans to send Allard across the \nnarrow sea\n to carry the declaration to\nthe \nFree Cities\n as well, so that all the world will know of his claim and Cersei's infamy.\nAfter Stannis dismisses Pylos, Davos asks what the lords thought of the letter. Stannis snorts that they all flattered\nhim except Velaryon, who said steel would decide the matter as if Stannis never suspected as much. Stannis curses\nhis lords and asks Davos for the truth. Davos declares the words blunt and strong, but reminds Stannis they still have\nno firm proof of incest. Stannis replies there is proof of a sort at \nStorm's End\n: \nRobert\n's acknowledged bastard \nEdric\nStorm\n is the very image of Robert, yet his supposed sons \nJoffrey\n and \nTommen\n look nothing like him. Davos reminds\nStannis that they cannot reach Edric at Storm's End.\nDavos also suggests removing the reference to the Lord of Light from the letter in favor of a something less specific.\nWhen Stannis asks if he has become devout, Davos says he does not know this new god but knew the ones they\nburned. Stannis argues that it was only wood they burned, but Davos mentions that charitable septons would feed\nhim when he was a begging boy. Davos explains that the people will not love Stannis if he takes away their familiar\ngods and gives them a foreign one. Stannis replies that the people have never loved him.\nGazing out the window, Stannis declares he stopped believing in gods the day he saw the \nWindproud\n break up on\nShipbreaker Bay\n, refusing to worship any gods monstrous enough to drown his parents. The \nHigh Septon\n always\nprattles about justice and goodness flowing from the gods, but Stannis insists all he ever saw of either was made by\nmen. Davos asks why Stannis would trouble with a new god if he does not believe. Stannis answers that, god or no\ngod, Melisandre has power. Davos replies that Maester \nCressen\n had wisdom, but Stannis argues that Cressen's wise\nadvice did no good: the \nstorm lords\n laughed when he went begging. Stannis declares there will be no more begging\nor laughing. The Iron Throne is rightfully his, but of the four kings he has the fewest men and the least gold. His\nonly assets are his ships and the red woman. Stannis asks if Davos knows that half his men are afraid to even speak\nher name; a sorceress who can inspire such dread is not to be despised, and he means to find out if she can do more.\nStannis recalls that as a boy he nursed an injured goshawk named \nProudwing\n, who would follow him about and eat\nfrom his hand but would not hunt. Finally, his great-uncle Ser \nHarbert\n told him, rightly, that he should try a different\nbird because he was embarrassing himself. Stannis turns back to Davos and declares that the Seven have never\nbrought him so much as a sparrow. It is time he tried another hawk, a red hawk.\nNavigation:\nArya III\n ←\nDavos I\n→ \nTheon I\n↓\nDavos II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 11: Theon I\nPlace(s): \nAboard the \nMyraham\n, \nLordsport\n and \nPyke\n \n \nNavigation:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STANNIS BARATHEON<|>PERSON<|>Stannis Baratheon is a claimant to the Iron Throne of Westeros, brother of the late King Robert Baratheon, and Lord of Storm’s End.
