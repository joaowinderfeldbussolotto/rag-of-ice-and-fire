When she hears the summoning bells, she\njoins the crowd to watch \nher father\n confess his treason. Once the confession is done, King \nJoffrey\n demands his head.\nArya attempts to get to him, but \nYoren\n of the \nNight's Watch\n stops her. Afterward, he declares that she is coming\nwith him.\nSynopsis\nArya\n is catching pigeons on the Street of Flour. Compared with catching cats, pigeons are easy. She uses her\nwooden practice sword to knock one from the air and snaps its neck.\nAfter taking the pigeon, Arya walks by a cart filled with tarts. When she asks for one, she is charged three coppers\nshe doesn’t have. The man also declines to trade for her pigeon. Arya uses the seeing taught by \nSyrio Forel\n and\ndecides she could steal one and get away, but the seller guesses her intention and points out the two \ngold cloaks\nclose by. Even though they are paying her no attention, the sight of the gold cloaks ties Arya's stomach in knots and\nshe lets the man pass.\nAt the \nRed Keep\n, which she avoids, Arya can see the heads rotting on spikes. There are all sorts of stories among the\nsmallfolk: Lord \nRenly\n killed King \nRobert\n and fled, or the king died hunting a boar, or the king died \neating\n a boar, or\nthe king was poisoned by \nVarys\n or by the \nqueen\n. The stories only agree that the king is dead.\nArya wants to leave \nKing's Landing\n, but the seven city gates are either closed completely, open only to entering, or\nclosely guarded by \nLannister\n guardsmen and gold cloaks, who search everything and ask questions. Once she\nconsidered swimming the river, but the current is treacherous and she cannot afford a ferry or a ship. Arya imagines\nthat if she can escape to the countryside, she can dig for roots, find orchards, pick berries, and travel north.\nThere are pot shops in \nFlea Bottom\n where she can get her birds cooked or exchanged for some bread or stew, but the\npeople in them seem dangerous. Arya has even been chased a couple of times when leaving, probably for her boots\nor cloak, but she outran them. She often goes hungry rather than endure the stares of the people in the pot shops. The\nfirst night she spent on the street, her silver bracelet and her bundle of good clothes were stolen while she slept. All\nthe thieves left her were the clothes and cloak she was wearing, her practice sword, and her real sword “\nNeedle\n,”\nwhich she was sleeping on.\nShe misses her brothers. She tried to talk to the other children, but must have talked wrong (likely with a \nnorthern\naccent) because the young ones all ran away and the older ones asked questions, called her names, or tried to steal\nfrom her. One girl, twice her age, even knocked her down to try to steal her boots and was rewarded with a smack\nfrom Arya's practice sword.\nOn her daily circuit to check the city gates, Arya decides to go to the riverfront on her way to the \nMud Gate\n to see if\nshe might be able to stow away on a ship. The wharfs are too quiet. On a pier she sees men in the livery of\nWinterfell\n guarding a ship. She learns from a passing longshoreman that the ship is called the \nWind Witch\n out of\nMyr\n, which is the same ship that her father contracted to take her and \nSansa\n home. As she approaches the ship, Arya\n\nsuddenly remembers to use the seeing that Syrio taught her again and realizes she does not know the guards. They\ncall to her and she plays the part of a boy trying to sell them the pigeon, knowing they will recognize her if she runs.\nThe ploy works and they send her away dismissively.\nSomehow, Arya finds her way back to Flea Bottom and discovers her pigeon is gone, either stolen or dropped. Then\nshe hears the bells of \nBaelor's Sept\n and wonders what it means this time. From one of the passersby she hears that it\nis a summoning and from another she hears that the gold cloaks are carrying the \nHand of the King\n to the sept.\nArya follows the masses. All around her the townsfolk are discussing \nher father\n and the rumors of his treason. She\npushes through the crowd and finds herself next to the statue of \nBaelor the Blessed\n, the \nSepton\n King, and climbs up\nso she can see. From this vantage point she can see her father supported by two gold cloaks in a rich velvet doublet\nand a grey cloak, his face drawn with pain and thinner than Arya has ever seen. With him on the pulpit are the \nHigh\nSepton\n, King \nJoffrey\n, Queen \nCersei\n, \nthe Hound\n, four other members of the \nKingsguard\n, \nVarys\n, \nLittlefinger\n, and\nSansa\n; Arya wonders why Sansa is there and why she looks so happy.\nThen\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e6363bd09c84bf3b6ab89db1eb21a3829f99fbe1a0e72af7f1744cdbf6effcc2_v2"}
