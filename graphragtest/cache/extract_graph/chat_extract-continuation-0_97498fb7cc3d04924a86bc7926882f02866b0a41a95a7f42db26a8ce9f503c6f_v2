In his chambers, Jon privately treats his \ngreyscale\n with wine. If his condition became known, he fears\nthat any lords still loyal to \nHouse Connington\n would abandon him.\n\nFour days later, Prince Aegon arrives along with \nDuck\n, the first member of his \nKingsguard\n. Jon recalls his\ndisapproval of that choice and how he argued with Aegon that they should leave places in his Kingsguard open to\nboth warriors of great renown or the younger sons of important lords to add lustre to their cause, but Aegon refused,\nsaying all he wanted from his Kingsguard was their willingness to die defending him, pointing out that Jon's criteria\nfor the Kingsguard perfectly fits \nthe Kingslayer\n. Jon informs him that his men plan to take \nStorm's End\n in ten days\n(he had refused the suggestions of the Golden Company officers to make an alliance with \nStannis Baratheon\n, who\nholds it, arguing that Stannis is Robert's brother, a rival claimant to the throne and leagues away from them with\nnothing to offer). Aegon agrees to this plan, and tells him that he intends for the siege to go forward with one\nchange: Aegon will lead the attack himself.\nNavigation:\nThe Lost Lord\n↑\nThe Spurned Suitor\n ←\nThe Griffin Reborn\n→ \nThe Sacrifice\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 62: The Sacrifice\nPlace(s): \ncrofters' village\n in the \nwolfswood\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe King's Prize\n↑\nThe Griffin Reborn\n ←\nThe Sacrifice\n→ \nVictarion I\nSynopsis\nAsha Greyjoy\n is still a prisoner of \nStannis Baratheon\n at the \ncrofters' village\n between the lakes, being guarded by\nAlysane Mormont\n. While they thought they would be only three days from \nWinterfell\n, the snows have kept them\nstranded for nineteen days. Food has become a major concern. The supply of fish from the lake has been\ndiminishing, they have already been relying on their dying horses as a source of food for a while now, and foraging\nhas brought little result. Some men have even begun to resort to cannibalism: four men from \nHouse Peasebury\n were\ncaught eating parts of a dead man from \nHouse Fell\n.\nThere are growing tensions between the \nqueen's men\n that Stannis brought with him from Dragonstone and the other\npeople present, both local northerners and the \nking's men\n that Stannis brought from \nDragonstone\n and the \nStormlands\nwith him.\nFueling those tensions, Ser \nGodry Farring\n the Giantslayer, Ser \nCorliss Penny\n and Ser \nClayton Suggs\n are about to\nburn the four cannibals in sacrifice for \nR'hllor\n, hoping to stope the snowfall. Northerners \nArtos Flint\n and \nBig Bucket\nWull\n express dislike of the sacrifice. Asha has noticed that Clayton Suggs is a cruel man and fears that he may\neventually turn against her.\nStannis himself has been retreating to a tower roof with a perennial flame for four days, since his squire \nBryen\nFarring\n was given a funeral burning after dying from the cold. He returns now, along with Queen's Man Ser \nRichard\nHorpe\n and \nKarhold\n's castellan \nArnolf Karstark\n, whose men joined theirs eight days past. There are rumors that\nArnolf may hold Winterfell in Stannis' behest if they are successful at retaking the castle. Stannis authorizes the\nsacrifice and watches it until its end.\nSer \nJustin Massey\n remains close to Asha and protects her from the worst of Clayton Suggs' threats. He also reveals\nthat he is no longer a true believer in R'hllor and hints that he knows more than he is telling.\nJustin offers to guard Asha for a while, relieving Aly Mormont from that duty. The two of them eat some roasted\nhorse in the hall. Stannis' knights are however lost by a lack of options, knowing that they are likely to die soon no\nmatter what they do, since they have no food nor are they in any condition to fight \nRoose Bolton\n's forces at\nWinterfell. Talk is tense and frustrated, and eventually Justin leaves the Hall. Attempting to follow him, Asha finds\nClayton Suggs instead. He threatens her, but the two of them are surprised to find that riders are coming to Stannis'\nencampment.\nAssuming that this is an attack from the Boltons and \nFreys\n, Clayton commands Asha to warn the others while he\nalone attempts to delay the riders. But there is no immediate danger, for the riders are not hostile. It is instead the\ngroup of \nTycho Nestoris\n, representative of the \nIron Bank of Braavos\n, with two men of the \nNight's Watch\n and the\nseven \nironmen\n that he ransomed from \nSybelle Locke\n. Asha recognizes \nTristifer Botley\n among them.\nThe group has come by way of Winterfell, where they found \nCrowfood Umber\n beating drums and blowing horns,\nand have brought \nTheon\n and \nJeyne\n from Winterfell.\nJeyne's nose is black from frostbite, and no one has referred to her by name yet, so it is not clear whether Tycho's\ngroup knows that she is
