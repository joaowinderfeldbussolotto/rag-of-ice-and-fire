For 19 days the ship barely manages to stay\nafloat as food and water dwindle and the sun beats down on them relentlessly. Then a sail turns up on the horizon,\nreigniting hope in them until \nJorah\n realizes it's a slaver ship.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VIII\n↑\nJon VIII\n ←\nTyrion IX\n→ \nThe Turncloak\n↓\nTyrion X\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 41: The Turncloak\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Prince of Winterfell\n↑\nTyrion IX\n ←\nThe Turncloak\n→ \nThe King's Prize\n↓\nA Ghost in Winterfell\nSynopsis\nA winter snowstorm has hit \nWinterfell\n. \nRoose Bolton\n comments that the northern gods do not favour \nStannis\n as he is\nat the mercy of the weather while they are sheltered in Winterfell. His men cheer, but \nTheon\n does not join in and\nnotes that the \nFreys\n do not join in either, unfamiliar with the north that has claimed three of their lives already.\nWyman Manderly\n is eating at a feast of porridge, while \nHarwood Stout\n and \nWhoresbane Umber\n chat. Theon spent\nthe whole last night awake dreaming of escape, but ultimately decides he has no where to go; he is a ruined man in a\nruined castle, and this is where he belongs. The bard Abel plays \"\nThe Dornishman's Wife\n\" with one of his women\nbeating a drum, but he switches the lyrics to a northman instead. Theon fears that this will be seen as a spite to the\nBoltons\n, cost the man his life, angering Ramsay and getting Theon flayed as a result. But when both of the Boltons\nlaugh, the others see that it is safe so they laugh as well and join in with the bawdy song.\nHis thoughts fall to \nthe fake Arya\n, taking note that she has remained locked away in her room. There are whispers\nthat \nRamsay\n keeps her chained naked to the bed, but Theon believes that it is only the guards that keep her there. He\nhas seen bruises on her body as \nSour Alyn\n has assigned Theon as Jeyne's handmaid. Theon told her that Ramsay\nonly hurts people when they make him angry, so she should do as he says and no harm will come to her. But she\nonly cried and called him Theon, and he corrected her, telling her that his name is Reek.\nRowan\n, one of the bard's women, comes up to Theon and asks him about his exploits, telling him that Abel can\nmake a song about his capture of Winterfell. She questions him on how he was able to conquer Winterfell so easily,\nwondering if there was a secret entrance or another way that he used to get in. Theon thinks this is another ploy from\nRamsay as he desires Rowan, so he runs away, leaving her.\nOutside there is a snowball fight between boys from the \nRills\n and \nBarrowton\n, while squires build snowmen along\nthe battlements. Theon observes that a new stable has been built, twice as large as the one that was burned down. He\nwanders through the castle and passes \nRickard Ryswell\n cuddling one of Abel's women. He observes that they have\nfew provisions to last the winter in the keep, but thinks that Stannis is in the same situation. He eventually arrives at\nthe \nweirwood\n, kneeling before the heart tree. There he apologizes for something, and asks for something that he is\nunsure of - strength? He hears someone crying and leaves, thinking that there are ghosts in Winterfell, and he is one\nof them.\nTheon returns and sees that to command the snowmen, the squires have built a dozen snowy lords, including ones\nresembling Lord \nWyman Manderly\n, Lord \nHarwood Stout\n, Lady \nBarbrey Dustin\n, and \nWhoresbane Umber\n. Lady\nDustin asks him if he can show her the way to the crypts, as she cannot access them from the dungeons. As her men\ndig through the snow, Lady Dustin asks Theon to convince Ramsay to treat Arya better. The northmen love the\nStarks\n and hate the Boltons, remaining loyal only out of fear. The tears of Arya Stark will upset them and do Roose\nand Ramsay more harm than anything Stannis could do.\nInside the crypts they find that some of the dead kings' swords are missing. A bad omen, Theon thinks, as the swords\nare said to protect the crypt and keep the spirits of the dead from wandering. Dustin asks Theon why he loves the\nStarks, and Theon reluctantly explains he always wanted to be one, but never could. Dustin remarks that they are\n\nsimilar in that regard, explaining how \nBrandon Stark\n took her maidenhead and was enamored with her rather than\nwith his betrothed, \nCatelyn Tully\n. \nRickard Stark\n arranged the betrothal of his eldest son to Catelyn, a match that\nserved his ambitions more than one to Lady Barbrey, a daughter of one of his own northern vassals.
