After a long\nsilence, Sam tells the story of why he was sent to the Wall. His father, Lord \nRandyll Tarly\n, was disgusted that his\neldest son was so plump, soft, awkward, and squeamish. Sam’s interest in music, books, dancing, and soft clothes\nonly made matters worse. Many masters-at-arms were brought to Horn Hill to try to make Sam into the type of\nmany his father wanted. When a second son, \nDickon\n was finally born, Lord Randyll had given up on Sam. On his\n15th name day, Sam says, he was escorted to his father in a wood, where he was informed that he was to forsake his\nclaim to Horn Hill and join the Night’s Watch, or else his father would arrange an accident. Jon finds it strange that\nSam tells the story in such a detached voice and does not weep even once. Jon tells Sam about some of the other\nrecruits, and Sam eventually states he should get some sleep and plods off.\nJon returns to the common room. His friends explain that they did not shun Sam; there were places on the bench but\nSam was such a craven that he just passed them by. Jon persuades them all to not beat Sam anymore, whatever Ser\nAlliser says. \nRast\n, however, insists that if Thorne sends him against “Lady Piggy,” he will cut off a rasher of bacon,\nand laughs in Jon’s face. That night, Jon—with Pyp, Grenn, and Ghost—visits Rast in his cell. With Ghost’s mouth\naround Rast's throat, Jon tells Rast that they know where he sleeps.\nAfter that, no matter what Ser Alliser does, he cannot get any of the recruits to do anything but tap Sam when they\nare put up against him. Sam later thanks Jon and calls him his first friend; Jon responds that they are not friends but\nbrothers. Jon now realizes that \nRobb\n, \nBran\n and \nRickon\n are his father’s sons, but that he has never been one of them;\nhis true brothers are the outcasts of the Night’s Watch. He realizes his uncle was right, and wonders if he will ever\nsee Benjen again to tell him.\nNavigation:\nJon III\n↑\nEddard V\n ←\nJon IV\n→ \nEddard VI\n↓\nJon V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 27: Eddard VI\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard V\n↑\nJon IV\n ←\nEddard VI\n→ \nCatelyn V\n↓\nEddard VII\nNed\n and the \nsmall council\n deal with policing problems caused by the upcoming \ntourney\n. After the meeting, \nJory\nCassel\n reports to Ned on interviews with \nJon Arryn\n’s remaining household. The report includes mention of visits by\nLord Arryn and \nStannis Baratheon\n to a \nbrothel\n and an \narmorer\n. Ned orders Jory to identify the brothel and goes to\nvisit the armorer himself. There he discovers an apprentice named \nGendry\n who looks astonishingly like King\nRobert\n.\nSynopsis\nNed\n and the \nsmall council\n hear \nCity Watch\n Commander \nJanos Slynt\n’s report about the significant increase in crime\ncaused by the influx of people arriving for the upcoming tourney. Slynt requests more men. Ned agrees to hire fifty\nnew watchmen, setting \nLittlefinger\n to arrange the monetary details. When Littlefinger objects, Ned insists that since\nhe found 40,000 \ngold dragons\n for the champion’s purse, he should be able to scrape together a few coppers to keep\nthe King’s Peace. Ned also loans Slynt twenty of his own household guard.\nNed complains again about the tourney, still irritated that it is to be called \"\nthe Hand's tourney\n\" despite his distaste.\nMoreover, King \nRobert\n still insists that Ned should feel honored. Grand \nMaester\n \nPycelle\n points out that a tourney is\ngood for the realm because it brings the great an opportunity for glory and the lowly a respite from their woes.\nLittlefinger adds that it brings in lots of money, emphasizing full inns and whores walking bowlegged. Lord \nRenly\nlaughs, telling how his brother \nStannis\n once proposed outlawing brothels, prompting Robert to ask if he wanted to\noutlaw eating, shitting, and breathing as well. Renly goes on to wonder how Stannis ever fathered his \ndaughter\n when\nhe goes to his marriage bed like he is marching to a battlefield to do his duty. Everyone laughs except Ned, who is\npreoccupied by thoughts of when Stannis will return and assume his \nduties\n on the council.\nAfter the council adjourns, Ned returns to the \nTower of the Hand\n and summons \nJory Cassel\n. As he waits for his\nhorse to be saddled, Ned peruses the book that \nJon Arryn\n had been reading prior to his death: \nLineages of the Great\nHouses\n by Grand Maester \nMalleon\n. Its reading has proven extremely tedious, just as Pycelle warned, and scarcely a\nman now alive had been born when it was written, but Ned is sure \nJon Arryn\n had a reason for reading it. As he\nbrowses the section on \nHouse Lannister\n, Ned muses on their long history and the myths of their ancestor \nL\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ee71c9dd968df44dd9ad72277c5487f325bc653333d2ef8757a57f5ecafdf200_v2"}
