Tywin informs them that \nDaven Lannister\n is rounding up a new army\nand will join with men from the \nGolden Tooth\n, and then march on \nRiverrun\n when \nRobb Stark\n returns north. They all\nagree that Robb will march for \nMoat Cailin\n, for he is a king without a kingdom.\nKevan\n reveals that \nBalon Greyjoy\n has sent letters with terms of alliance. Greyjoy wants the \nNorth\n, but Tywin says\nthey will not treat with Balon while other options may present themselves. \nLittlefinger\n agrees to go to the \nEyrie\n to\nmarry \nLysa Arryn\n, and once he is consort, deliver \nthe Vale\n of Arryn into Tywin's hands. Since Littlefinger will be\nleaving within a day, Tyrion is named \nmaster of coins\n. \nPycelle\n informs them that 300 \nDornishmen\n ride for \nKing's\nLanding\n in response to Tyrion's negotiations, despite the hatred between \nDorne\n and \nHighgarden\n that has gone on for\nhundreds of years.\nMace Tyrell\n does not like the idea of Dornishmen riding across \nthe Reach\n. Tyrion considers how the Lord of\nHighgarden talked like a general although he had never won a decisive battle. His victory over \nRobert Baratheon\n at\nAshford\n was won by Randyll Tarly and the \nsiege of Storm's End\n lasted for a year without result until \nEddard Stark\nrelieved the castle.\nGarlan Tyrell\n has been named Lord of \nBrightwater Keep\n since \nAlester Florent\n is a traitor. \nVarys\n brings word of a\nthree-headed dragon being born in \nQarth\n, and that the \nNight's Watch\n is begging for help against a \nwildling\n army.\nLord Tywin\n does not want to hear about rumors of dragons, and is disinterested in news of wildlings, claiming that\nif \nthe Wall\n is overrun, the \nStarks\n and \nGreyjoys\n will have a new enemy to deal with, even speculating they may be\nable to make a deal with \nMance Rayder\n, overriding the attempts of Varys and Tyrion to have gold cloaks who\ndeserted during the \nBattle of the Blackwater\n forced to take the black. He adjourns the meeting, asking Tyrion, \nCersei\nand Kevan to stay. Tyrion warns them not to trust Littlefinger with this quest to the Vale, but Tywin is resolute,\nbelieving it better to have Baelish ruling the Vale as opposed to the likes of \nYohn Royce\n or \nLyn Corbray\n and adds\nthat Littlefinger has proven his loyalty, telling Tyrion that just the other day Baelish informed them of a plot by the\nTyrells to bring \nSansa\n to Highgarden and marry her to \nWillas\n. The Hand is aware that should Mace Tyrell ask leave\nto bring Sansa to Highgarden, they must consent or else offend the Tyrells. Tywin wishes to circumvent this\nproblem by offering Cersei's hand in marriage to Willas. Cersei adamantly refuses but her father has the final say,\nand Cersei storms out of the room in a fury. Tywin then tells Tyrion that he will wed Sansa Stark, further solidifying\nthe Lannisters's position, because should \nRobb\n die and Sansa and Tyrion have a son, the child will become Lord of\nWinterfell\n.\nTyrion protests, arguing that a marriage to Sansa is worthless while the Greyjoys hold the north and questions why\nhe isn't being forced into a marriage with Balon's \ndaughter\n, but Tywin counters that the \nironborn\n won't rule the\nnorth, they will just plunder it, uniting the northmen against them, which the Lannisters can use to retake the north\nwhen Tyrion brings Ned Stark's grandson home to claim his birthright. Tyrion argues again, protesting that Sansa is\nstill a child, but Tywin retorts with Cersei's testimony the girl has flowered. Tyrion suggests sending the girl back to\nher mother\n as a gesture of goodwill that might make Robb Stark bend the knee, but Tywin coldly retorts that if they\n\ndo that, Sansa will be married off to one of the northern or Riverlords to shore up her brother's alliances. Tywin adds\nthat this marriage is a reward for Tyrion's previous service and threatens that if Tyrion won't go through with it, they\nwill marry Sansa off to Lancel or another of his cousins and find Tyrion another bride; the threat of being married to\nLollys Stokew\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SMALL
