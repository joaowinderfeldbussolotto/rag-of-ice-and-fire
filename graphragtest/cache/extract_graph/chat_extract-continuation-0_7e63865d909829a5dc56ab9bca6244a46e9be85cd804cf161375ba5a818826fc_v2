Asha liked him\nin the beginning but became bored with him before he was sent away. Tristifer, though, has never forgotten her and\nwants to wed Asha. He is the legitimate Lord of \nHouse Botley\n. His \nfather\n has been killed by Euron Greyjoy for\nrefuting Euron's claim to the throne. His titles have been given to Tristifer's uncle who supported Euron. Asha\nsharply refuses Tristifer's advances by reminding him that they are not children anymore and that she is his queen,\nnot his wife.\nEaster egg\n: In the chapter Rodrik Harlaw mentions an Archmaester named \nRigney\n who believes that history is a\nwheel. \nThe Wheel of Time\n fantasy series author Robert Jordan's real name is James Rigney.\nNavigation:\nSansa I\n ←\nThe Kraken's Daughter\n→ \nCersei III\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nThe Wayward Bride\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 12: Cersei III\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei II\n↑\nThe Kraken's Daughter\n ←\nCersei III\n→ \nThe Soiled Knight\n↓\nCersei IV\nSynopsis\nCersei\n is remembering her concession to the \nQueen of Thorns\n to allow \nTommen\n and \nMargaery\n to sleep in the same\nbed on their wedding night only, when \nJaime\n arrives to speak to her. He asks if she still means to burn down the\nTower of the Hand\n after the wedding, but she is determined to see it destroyed, and hopefully smoke out a few rats\nin the process. We begin to notice changes in Cersei, including weight gain and overindulgence in alcohol.\nTommen's wedding is a modest affair compared to \nhis brother\n's, and the ceremony goes over well enough.\nAfterwards, \nKevan\n comes over to Cersei and mentions that \nSandor Clegane\n is reported to have joined \nBeric\nDondarrion\n's \noutlaws\n. The queen is already aware of this, having heard that outlaws have pillaged \nSaltpans\n and\nsavagely raped the townswomen. The report mentioned that they were led by a huge man in a hound's head helmet.\nCersei suggests that \nLancel\n hunt down the Hound, but her uncle scoffs that his son is not the man to deal with\nClegane. When she then suggests that he go after Clegane himself, Ser Kevan responds, \"When a dog goes bad, the\nfault lies with its master.\" Talking to Jaime, she wonders if Margaery is really a maiden, and he tells her that \nMace\nTyrell\n will be marching on \nStorm's End\n in a few days, while \nGarlan Tyrell\n will take half the Tyrell host to\nBrightwater Keep\n and then on to \nHighgarden\n, including Lady \nAlerie Tyrell\n and Lady Olenna. During the reception,\nCersei recalls her visit to a \nwoods witch\n when she was younger, and the old hag's words: Queen you shall be, until\nthere comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear. Drinking heavily\nduring the feast, she begins to wonder if Margaery is the one in the hag's prophecy, which also mentions the\nvalonqar\n.\nWhen Tommen chokes on his wine accidentally, Cersei flees the hall for some air. She is met outside by Lady\nTaena\n, who informs her that one of Cersei's maids is a spy reporting to Margaery's cousins. Cersei assumes it is\nSenelle\n, and promises to reward Lady Merryweather if this is true. Asking why the beauty from Myr would venture\nthis info, Taena responds that she wants what is best for her \nhusband\n and \nson\n, and Cersei could provide\nadvancement for \nher family\n. Back inside, Cersei refuses to dance with anyone, but takes note of how attractive the\nBastard of Driftmark, \nAurane Waters\n, is: with his silvery hair - a mark of \nhouse Velaryon\n which is descended from\nthe Freehold of \nValyria\n like \nthe Targaryens\n - he almost resembles \nPrince Rhaegar\n.\nTowards the end of the night, Cersei leads everyone outside to watch as the pyromancers set the Tower of the Hand\non fire. As the green flames of wildfire consume the Tower, the queen regent compares the beauty of the spectacle to\nJoffrey. As the others begin to depart for bed, Cersei remains behind to watch the fires burn, arm in arm with Ser\nOsmund Kettleblack\n.\nNavigation:\nCersei II\n↑\nThe Kraken's Daughter\n ←\nCersei III\n→ \nThe Soiled Knight\n↓\nCersei IV\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 13: The Soiled Knight\nPlace(s): \nSunspear\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei III\n ←\nThe Soiled Knight\n→ \nBrienne III\nSynopsis\nSlipping through the shadow city of \nSunspear\n during the night for a rendezvous with Princess \nArianne\n, Ser \nArys\nOakheart\n considers how unlikely it is for an \nOakheart\n to even be in \nDorne\n.
