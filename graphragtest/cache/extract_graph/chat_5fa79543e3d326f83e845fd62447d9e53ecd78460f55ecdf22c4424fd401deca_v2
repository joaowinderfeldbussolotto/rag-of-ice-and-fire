Robb asks Catelyn what they are going to do with the 18,000 men he does\nhave. Catelyn can tell that Robb is caught in indecision, which will not do. Knowing he is worried about his father\nand sisters, Catelyn explains to her son that if he goes to \nKing's Landing\n to bend the knee he will never be allowed\nto leave, and if he retreats to Winterfell his lords will lose respect for him. In either case, Cersei can then do as she\nlikes to her captives without fear. Their only hope is that Robb can defeat the \nLannisters\n in the field; Cersei cannot\nharm her captives because she will need them as hostages if things go against her. However, if Robb loses there is\nno hope for any of them and they will suffer the fate of the \nTargaryen children\n; there is naught but stone at the heart\nof \nCasterly Rock\n. Robb states that that makes it simple: he will not lose.\nCatelyn then asks about the situation in the \nRiverlands\n. Robb informs her that \nthe war\n has begun. A fortnight past,\nSer \nJaime Lannister\n \nsmashed\n the \nTully\n force led by Lords \nVance\n and \nPiper\n at the \nGolden Tooth\n and is now\nadvancing on \nRiverrun\n. Meanwhile, Lord \nTywin Lannister\n has come up from the south with an even larger army.\nThis army \nambushed\n the party of Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n sent to bring Gregor Clegane to justice, killing \nRaymun\nDarry\n and most of the men from Winterfell. Lord Beric may have escaped, but no one knows for sure. Now Lord\nTywin is marching north to \nHarrenhal\n, burning as he goes.\nThe news is worse than Catelyn imagined. She asks Robb if he plans to await Lord Tywin’s army at Moat Cailin,\nbut Robb says that no one thinks that Tywin will be stupid enough to come that far; instead he will take the castles\nof the river lords one by one. Robb believes that they should march south to meet him. Catelyn questions the idea of\nleaving their strong position at Moat Cailin, fearing that her son has no chance against seasoned battle commanders\nlike Tywin and Jaime Lannister. Robb explains that his supplies are running low and that an army the size of his\ncannot live off this land forever; now that Lord Manderly’s force has arrived, they need to march. Catelyn realizes\nthe truth in what Robb says, remembering that Robb’s is not a standing army, but a levy of fishermen and farmers\nthat will not stay cohesive if left idle.\nDeclaring that marching is all well and good, Catelyn asks Robb where he plans on marching \nto\n. Again Robb is\nuncertain; the Greatjon believes they should take the battle to Lord Tywin, while others think they should join with\nSer \nEdmure Tully\n to defend Riverrun. Catelyn tells her son that, since he appointed himself battle commander, he\nmust command; he cannot appear indecisive in front of his lords.\nCatelyn asks Robb again what he intends to do. He declares that both plans have their merits, but he does not think a\ncommander as experienced as Lord Tywin will be easily surprised and his forces are too strong to defeat easily.\nRobb decides to have his infantry continue down the \nKingsroad\n but to send his horse across the \nGreen Fork\n and then\nsouth to relieve Riverrun. This will put the river between his two forces but also between Tywin and Jaime.\nHowever, the only available crossing of the Green Fork is at \nthe Twins\n, which is controlled by \nHouse Frey\n.\nAlthough a bannerman to \nHouse Tully\n, Lord \nWalder Frey\n has never been the most loyal; all Catelyn can think of is\nthat the “Late” Lord Frey failed to arrive at the \nBattle of the Trident\n until after the battle was done. She tells Robb\nthat \nher father\n has never trusted Lord Walder and that he should not either.\nCatelyn, impressed by Robb’s plan, asks who will command each force. Robb informs her of his plan to lead the\nmounted force to Riverrun himself, while command of his main army of foot soldiers moving south to intercept\nLord Tywin will be given to the Greatjon. In an attempt to show Robb his error, Catelyn points out that his father\nconsidered the Greatjon one of his most fearless men, but that his father is not fearless; he is brave, but that is\ndifferent. Robb reconsiders and decides he needs a man of caution and cold cunning to lead the main force. Robb\nrealizes that he should put \nRoose Bolton\n, whose cold cunning scares even him, in command; hopefully Bolton will\nscare Lord Tywin as well.\n\nRobb states that he wants Catelyn to return to Winterfell. She insists that her father is dying and her brother is\nsurrounded by foes; her place is with them at Riverrun.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VII\n↑\nDaenerys VI\n ←\nCatelyn VIII\n→ \nTyrion VII\n↓\nCatelyn IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 56\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5fa79543e3d326f83e845fd62447d9e53ecd78460f55ecdf22c4424fd401deca_v2"}
