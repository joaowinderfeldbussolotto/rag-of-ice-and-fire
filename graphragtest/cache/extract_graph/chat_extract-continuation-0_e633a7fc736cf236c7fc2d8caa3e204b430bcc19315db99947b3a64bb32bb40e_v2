Ronnet begs to prove his loyalty in\nbattle, but the new \nHand of the King\n \nMace Tyrell\n refuses, and orders Ronnet kept in his quarters for the moment, in\naddition to sending the men-at-arms \nJaime\n sent to accompany Connington south - all former \nthugs\n of \nGregor\nClegane\n's - to the \nNight's Watch\n.\nKevan has begun to resent the demands of Mace Tyrell as Cersei did, but he realises he cannot openly oppose them;\nTyrell and his bannerman \nRandyll Tarly\n have both brought armies to \nKing's Landing\n, while the Lannisters' standing\narmy is still in the \nRiverlands\n. Tyrell insists that he will deal with Connington and his boy after Margaery's trial, but\nboth he and Tarly show much reluctance about it; Kevan however chides them. Tyrell then asks why Tommen can't\ndeclare Margaery's innocence without a trial, but Kevan insists that defying the Faith will send them straight into the\narms of Connington or \nStannis Baratheon\n at a time when the \nIronborn\n are attacking the Western lands as well. Mace\nTyrell retorts that \nPaxter Redwyne\n will drive the Ironmen back and that Stannis has to face both \nRoose Bolton\n and\nthe cold climate of the North. He also dismisses the threat Jon Connington and the exiles of the \nGolden Company\npose but Kevan is unsure; he still remembers when \nAerys\n appointed Connington to the role of Hand, and while\nTywin Lannister\n's assessment of Connington as unsuitable for the post proved true after his failure to kill \nRobert\nBaratheon\n at the \nBattle of the Bells\n, Kevan believes age has surely made Connington wiser, more cautious and more\ndangerous.\nThe small council all agree that Connington and his pretender must be crushed, lest \nDaenerys Targaryen\n receive\nword and leave \nMeereen\n to join forces with them. \nPycelle\n suggests that they buy off the Golden Company, but new\nMaster of Coin\n \nHarys Swyft\n dismisses this idea; thanks to Cersei's economic mismanagement, the treasury is nearly\nempty, the \nIron Bank of Braavos\n still demanding its money, pledges for new loans from \nMyr\n received no favorable\nresponse, and their hopes of replenishing the treasuries with the fabled wealth on \nDragonstone\n following \nSer Loras's\ncapture of the island have proven in vain. Mace Tyrell reacts angrily to that, arguing that Loras searched the castle\nand found no trace of gold or gemstones, nor the fabled cache of \ndragon eggs\n supposedly kept there; Kevan\npersonally thinks that Loras didn't look very hard, given that he is a young man prone to rash judgments, even more\nso following his injuries, and the \nValyrian\n sorcery used to construct Dragonstone likely hides many secrets, but\nKevan defuses the argument by suggesting Stannis likely took everything of value with him when he fled. Kevan\nalso suggests that Harys try \nPentoshi\n \nmagister\n moneylenders, or else go to Braavos and deal with the Iron Bank in\nperson.\nNext, business turns to the forthcoming trials; Kevan says that Cersei has chosen \ntrial by battle\n, with Ser \nRobert\nStrong\n to represent her as her champion. Tyrell and Tarly express deep misgivings about the man, which Kevan\nshares as they have all heard rumours: \nMeryn Trant\n says he has never seen Strong eat or drink, and \nBoros Blount\nclaims to have never seen him use the privy. Kevan muses that \n\"Dead men don't shit\"\n, suspecting that he and the\nothers know \nwho Strong really is\n. However, Kevan silences Mace's protests by arguing that if Cersei loses her trial,\nthe legitimacy of her children, and thus Margaery's claim to the throne as Tommen's queen will be called into\nquestion. He also assures the council that even if Cersei proves her innocence, she will be sent back to \nCasterly\nRock\n afterwards, and play no further part in ruling or Tommen's education.\n\nThe meeting adjourns, intending to reconvene in five days' time and leaving for later decisions about an inheritance\ninvolving \nHouse Rosby\n and six claims, as well as the preparation for \nMyrcella\n's upcoming marriage. Mace Tyrell\nmakes plain his scorn for the marriage, particularly after Myrcella's injuries, and suggests a better match for her;\nKevan muses that Mace likely has his son \nWillas\n in mind. He dismisses the idea, warning that reneging on\nMyrcella's betrothal now could be all the cause \nDoran Martell\n needs to side with Connington. Harys Swyft suggests\nthat they get the Dornish to deal with Connington and his\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KING
