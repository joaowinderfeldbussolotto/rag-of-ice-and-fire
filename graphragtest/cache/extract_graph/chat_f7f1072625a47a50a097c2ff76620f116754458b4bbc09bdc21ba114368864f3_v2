When Meera says that Jojen would like to see them, Little Walder warns that they will bite.\nPleased by the Reeds' interest, Bran promises that Summer at least will not bite and will keep Shaggydog away. He\ncannot recall ever meeting a crannogman and would like to talk more, but the feast is too noisy. When he learns\nfrom Ser Rodrik that they truly eat frogs, Bran sends the Reeds mutton, \naurochs\n, and beef stew, which they seem to\nlike. When Meera catches him staring, Bran blushes.\nAfter the tables are cleared away, the music and singing grows wilder. Mors Umber grabs a passing serving girl and\nbegins whirling her about the floor and others soon join in. Hodor dances by himself, while Wyman Manderly and\nthen Cley Cerwyn partner with little Beth Cassel. Ser Rodrik approaches Lady Hornwood, but she excuses herself.\nOnce again unable to participate, Bran watches long enough to be polite, then calls Hodor to carry him to bed,\nconscious of the stares of onlookers.\nJust outside the hall, they come upon Joseth and giggling woman with her skirts above her waist. The girl screams\nwhen she sees Hodor watching, so Bran has to tell him to leave them be. After getting help with his boots and\nbreeches, Bran dismisses Hodor and lies down to sleep. Then he recalls his father telling him the \nKingsguard\n were\nonce a shining example, and the finest knight he ever saw was Ser \nArthur Dayne\n, who would have killed him but for\nHowland Reed. His father became sad at that and spoke no further, but now Bran wishes he had asked what he\nmeant.\nBran goes to sleep thinking of knights, but his dreams are of wolves in the godswood again and he can hear and\nsmell the feast still going on. At the rattle of iron, he and his brother race to confront the strange intruders: a female\nand a young male with no taint of fear. Bran recognizes Meera's voice when she asks if Jojen knew the wolves\nwould be so big. Jojen points out they are still growing and opines that Shaggydog is full of fear and rage but\nSummer is stronger than he knows. Meera cautions her brother, but Jojen insists this is not the day he dies and\nreaches out to touch Summer. At his touch, Bran loses contact and suddenly feels he is falling again.\nNavigation:\nBran II\n↑\nTyrion V\n ←\nBran III\n→ \nCatelyn II\n↓\nBran IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 22: Catelyn II\nPlace(s): \nBitterbridge\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn I\n↑\nBran III\n ←\nCatelyn II\n→ \nJon III\n↓\nCatelyn III\nAs envoy to King \nRenly Baratheon\n, \nCatelyn\n arrives at \nBitterbridge\n to find \na great melee\n in progress. Afterward, the\nchampion \nBrienne of Tarth\n is granted her request to become one of Renly's \nRainbow Guard\n. That night Catelyn\nattends a feast and meets privately with Renly, who insists \nRobb\n must bend the knee to him. Then, a messenger\narrives with news that King \nStannis Baratheon\n has besieged \nStorm's End\n.\nSynopsis\nA cruel dawn wakes \nCatelyn\n from sweet dreams of happy family life. She is weary of riding, hurting, and being\nstrong, but she knows she cannot allow herself to be weak today. Outside her tent, she finds \nShadd\n stirring oats into\na kettle. Ser \nWendel Manderly\n suggests supplementing this with roast quail, but Catelyn decides oats and bread are\nsufficient since they have many leagues to travel.\nHer party includes twenty of \nRobb\n's best \nWinterfell\n men and five lordlings, including Ser Wendel, Ser \nPerwyn Frey\n,\nLucas Blackwood\n, and \nRobin Flint\n, to add weight and honor to her negotiations with King \nRenly\n. It is a mission\nCatelyn never wanted, but Robb insisted he had no one else: Lord \nHoster Tully\n was too ill, and he needed Ser\nBrynden Tully\n to command his scouts and Ser \nEdmure Tully\n to hold \nRiverrun\n when he marched. Catelyn argued\nthat marching was rash, but Robb insisted waiting would make him look afraid and weaken his position, especially\nsince \nLysa Arryn\n will not support him. Catelyn feared he planned to play into \nTywin Lannister\n's hand and march on\nHarrenhal\n, but Robb countered that he said nothing of Harrenhal. Catelyn smiles at the memory of Robb's obvious\nploy of threatening to send \nGreatjon Umber\n in her place, given how ill-suited the Greatjon is to treat with a man like\nRenly. Before leaving, she wrote to \nBran\n and \nRickon\n and visited her father but he mistook her for \nher mother\n.\nHalf a day's ride from Renly's camp they are spotted from a windmill and intercepted by Ser \nColen of Greenpools\nwith twenty men.
