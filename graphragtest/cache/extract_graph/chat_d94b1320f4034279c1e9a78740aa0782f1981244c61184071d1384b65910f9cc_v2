Reemerging,\nthey find \nChett\n using the hounds to search and cursing angrily. When Jon meets Chett's eyes, he can tell there is no\nlove lost between them. Thoren Smallwood, dressed in the late Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n's armor and cloak and looking\nmore lordly than Mormont, declares there were wildlings here a year ago. \nJarman Buckwell\n replies that much can\nchange in a year. Ser \nMallador Locke\n opines that fewer wildlings means fewer worries. Then \nBedwyck\n, a five-foot\nranger known as Giant, descends from the giant tree to report a lake to the north and low hill to the west. With three\nhours of daylight left, Mormont decides to head for the lake to make camp.\nAfter writing a report to \nMaester Aemon\n, the Lord Commander sends Jon to find \nSamwell Tarly\n to send the\nmessage. Jarman Buckwell's scouts ride out first, followed by Thoren Smallwood's vanguard, Mormont's main force,\nthe baggage train under Ser Mallador Locke, and finally the rear guard under Ser \nOttyn Wythers\n; a total of 200 men\nand 300 horses. As he rides, Jon exercises his scarred fingers to keep his sword hand from growing stiff and clumsy.\nHe is likely to need his sword hand \nbeyond the Wall\n, especially now. The black brothers left \nCastle Black\n in good\nspirits, but the silence of the wood has unnerved them all. Not only have the wildlings disappeared, but the game as\nwell. Even the veteran rangers agree the \nhaunted forest\n has never seemed so haunted.\nHe finds Sam watering the horses who carry the raven cages. A few of the ravens' shrieks sound like words, and Jon\n\nasks if Sam is teaching them to speak. Sam explains three of them to say \"snow.\" Jon comments that \none bird\ncroaking his name was enough. When Sam asks about Whitetree, Jon gives him Mormont's report. Sam dispatches a\nraven with the message, lamenting that he wishes it could carry him back as well. When Jon asks about him still\nbeing afraid, Sam admits he is not as frightened as he was. At first he could not sleep for fearing every noise was a\nwildling creeping up to kill him, but now he knows there are no wildlings around. Jon remarks to himself that two\nhundred brave men left \nthe Wall\n and only Sam, the self-confessed coward, is growing less afraid.\nSam says he is sore from the rough living, but he is working on his maps. Jon jokingly threatens to volunteer Sam as\nan outrider, which Sam emphatically protests. Sam then admits he hoped they would stay in the village under a roof.\nJon points out that their are not enough houses for everyone and rides off again.\nGhost\n, who has been hunting well away from the line of march, appears as Jon is swinging wide of the village to\navoid the congested column. The white wolf has been having no more luck than the foragers. Jon remembers telling\nDywen\n that their numbers were probably frightening away the game, but Dywen only agreed the game was being\nfrightened by \nsomething\n.\nWhen Jon rejoins Mormont, he mentions that Sam is teaching the ravens to talk. Mormont snorts that he will regret\nthat, as they make a lot of noise but say nothing worth hearing. They ride in silence for a while before Jon comments\non what his uncle \nBenjen\n would make of the empty villages. Mormont continues Jon's thought that Benjen would\nhave pushed on to find out why, and perhaps someone or something did not want that known. Mormont declares that\nwhen \nQhorin Halfhand\n joins them, they will be 300 men and not so easy for an enemy to deal with. He promises Jon\nthat they will find them, but Jon wonders if they will be found instead.\nNavigation:\nJon I\n↑\nDaenerys I\n ←\nJon II\n→ \nArya IV\n↓\nJon III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 14: Arya IV\nPlace(s): \nRiver\n and \ntown\n south of the \nGods Eye\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya III\n↑\nJon II\n ←\nArya IV\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nArya V\nArya\n and the others decide to spend the night in the holdfast of an \nabandoned town\n on the southern shores of the\nGods Eye\n.
