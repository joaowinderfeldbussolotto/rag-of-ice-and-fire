Dustin remarks that they are\n\nsimilar in that regard, explaining how \nBrandon Stark\n took her maidenhead and was enamored with her rather than\nwith his betrothed, \nCatelyn Tully\n. \nRickard Stark\n arranged the betrothal of his eldest son to Catelyn, a match that\nserved his ambitions more than one to Lady Barbrey, a daughter of one of his own northern vassals. After Brandon's\nbetrothal to Catelyn, the ambitious Lord Ryswell wanted Barbrey to marry \nEddard\n, but after Rickard and Brandon\nwere both murdered by \nthe Mad King\n, Eddard fulfilled his older brother’s betrothal to Catelyn to ensure support\nfrom \nRiverrun\n during \nRobert's Rebellion\n. Left to marry Lord \nWillam Dustin\n, she blames Ned for Lord Dustin's\ndeath at the \nTower of Joy\n during Robert's Rebellion. She felt slighted that Eddard merely buried her husband in\nDorne\n, yet went to great lengths to transport \nhis sister's\n body north to be buried at Winterfell.\nShe claims that she intends to seize Ned Stark's bones, delayed by the Iron Born's occupation of \nMoat Cailin\n, and\nfeed them to her dogs, rather than let them be buried in the crypt. On the way back up she tells him to repeat nothing\nto the Boltons.
