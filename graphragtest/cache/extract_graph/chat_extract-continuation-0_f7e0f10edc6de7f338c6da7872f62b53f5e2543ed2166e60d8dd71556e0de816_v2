Stannis promises that\nher daughters will be found when he takes King's Landing. Catelyn thinks his tone implies dead or alive, and tells\nhim that King’s Landing is closer to \nDragonstone\n, but he is at Storm’s End. He replies that he needs the power of the\nsouthron lords to take King’s Landing, and so he must take them from his brother, who owes him loyalty and\nobedience as his elder and rightful king. Stannis then asks if Robb has thrown his lot in with Renly, and is told he is\nKing of the North by the will of the lords and people, and only holds his hand out in friendship. Stannis replies that\nkings have no friends, only subjects and enemies.\nAt this point, Renly’s party arrives with \nBrienne of Tarth\n bearing the banner. Renly asks about Stannis' sigil and the\npriestess replies it is the fiery heart of the \nLord of Light\n. Renly says it is just as well since, if they had the same\nbanner, the battle would be confused. Catelyn expresses hope that there will be no battle, and Stannis states that the\nIron Throne\n is his by rights, and those who deny this are his foes. Catelyn tells them that this is folly with the\nKingslayer\n’s host reforming at the \nGolden Tooth\n, another \nLannister\n host gathering at \nCasterly Rock\n, and \nTywin\nLannister\n at \nHarrenhal\n with 20,000 men, and the Lannisters holding \nKing's Landing\n. Renly immediately demands\nthat Stannis bend his knee to him, and Stannis absolutely refuses, stating he is eldest and denouncing Renly as a\nusurper. Renly responds that the \nTargaryens\n called Robert a usurper and he bore up under the shame. Catelyn tries to\n\nconvince them to be reasonable, only to be rebuked by Stannis, who asserts that he is the rightful king; Stannis also\nadds that he considers her son no less a traitor than Renly, and promises to deal with Robb in due time. Catelyn asks\nhow he is the rightful king, given that Robert had two sons, at which Renly laughs, stating that she has not seen\nStannis’ letter. Stannis tells Catelyn that \nJoffrey\n and his siblings are not of Robert’s seed, but bastards born of incest\nbetween Cersei and her brother.\nCatelyn asks why Stannis kept this knowledge to himself, and is told that he approached \nJon Arryn\n since he figured\nthat Robert would be more willing to listen to Jon, whom he loved, as opposed to Stannis, from whom such\naccusations would have seemed self serving. Renly points out that Jon is dead, and Stannis states that his death was\nnot by happenstance, that \nCersei\n poisoned him. Catelyn, immediately putting the pieces together, adds that her sister\nLysa\n accused the queen of killing her husband. Renly tells Stannis that he may have the greater right, but Renly has\nthe bigger army.\nRenly reaches under his cloak, and Stannis immediately goes for his sword, but Renly only brings out a peach,\noffering it to Stannis. Stannis retorts he did not come there to eat fruit, and Renly replies a man should never refuse a\npeach because life is short and as the \nStarks\n say, “Winter is Coming.” Stannis thinks this is a threat but Renly states\nit was not, and he tells Stannis he never liked him, but he is of his blood, and if it is Storm’s End he wants, he will\ngive it to him. Stannis refuses, saying it is his. Renly states he refuses a peach, a castle and did not come to his\nwedding. Stannis sneers that the wedding was a farce, considering Renly married a woman he was scheming to\nmake one of Robert’s whores a year before. Renly corrects this, saying he was going to make \nMargaery Tyrell\n his\nqueen, but Robert was killed by a boar, and so he got Margaery. He reveals he plans to have a son with her within a\nyear, and then asks Stannis how many sons he has, telling him that if he had \na wife that looked like Stannis's\n, he\nwould send \nhis fool\n to service her as well. Infuriated, Stannis draws his blade which shines strangely, roaring that he\nwill not tolerate Renly mocking him to his face, but Brienne moves between them. Stannis tells Renly that he will\nnot kill Renly with \nLightbringer\n, and will give him till dawn to pledge to him, for the sake of their \nlate mother\n. In\nreturn, Stannis will grant him Storm’s End, a seat on the council, and name him his heir until he has a son; otherwise\nhe will destroy Renly. Renly laughs, pointing out that he has the strength in banners: \nHouse Rowan\n, \nHouse Tarly\n,\nHouse Caron\n, \nHouse Tarth\n, \nHouse Penrose\n, \nHouse Fossoway\n, \nHouse Cuy\n, \nHouse
