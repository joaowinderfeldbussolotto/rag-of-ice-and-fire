The \nMerry Midwife\n left after four days.\nSer \nMarlon Manderly\n takes Davos to treats with Lord \nWyman Manderly\n and his \nMerman's Court\n.

They have been long isolated from supplies, apparently forgotten by \nVictarion\n who\nbrought them there before leaving for the \nKingsmoot\n. The North's \ncrannogmen\n keep them under constant siege and\ntheir morale is so low that they no longer bother to even dispose of their dead.\nTheir nominal leader \nRalf Kenning\n is only barely alive, suffering a painful, slow, ugly death after being infected by\na poisoned arrow. Theon, torn between his conditioning to think of himself as Ramsay's plaything Reek and his\norders to present himself as Lord Balon Greyjoy's son, has glimpses of his past pride and identity and actually mercy\nkills Ralf Kenning before making demands of the mostly \nCodd\n men that still survive in the garrison.\nDagon Codd\n attempts to refuse his terms, but \nAdrack Humble\n kills him. The Ironborn surrender to Ramsay Bolton\nand hear empty promises of food and peace before being mercilessly killed and displayed at stakes along the road.\nTheon, still thinking of himself as Reek, is further humiliated by Ramsay and \"rewarded\" by being \"promoted\" to\nthe role of a dog. He meets Lord \nRoose Bolton\n as his own forces arrive at Moat Cailin with a sizeable number of\nFrey\n men, including \nHosteen Frey\n and \nAenys Frey\n, both of whom Theon recognizes from his time at their side as\npart of \nRobb\n's war campaign. At this point only about a fifth of the Northmen who went south with Robb Stark have\nreturned alive.\nTheon recognizes the newly arrived bride of Ramsay as an impostor; she is not \nArya Stark\n as claimed, but rather\nSansa\n's friend \nJeyne Poole\n.\nNavigation:\nReek I\n↑\nDavos III\n ←\nReek II\n→ \nJon V\n↓\nReek III\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 21: Jon V\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon IV\n↑\nReek II\n ←\nJon V\n→ \nTyrion VI\n↓\nJon VI\nSynopsis\nFollowing the departure of \nStannis\n's host, \nCastle Black\n is in a quiescent state, with the exception of the training yard.\nAlthough Stannis has vacated \nMormont\n's former chambers in King's Tower, Jon does not move in, knowing that\nothers may misconstrue the move as a sign that he does not expect Stannis to return.\nAgainst \nBowen Marsh\n's wishes, Jon accompanies a line of wagons under armed escort to deliver food to the\nwildlings\n who have taken refuge underground at \nMole's Town\n.
