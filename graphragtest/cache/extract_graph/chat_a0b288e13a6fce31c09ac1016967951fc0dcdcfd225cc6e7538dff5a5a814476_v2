Renly laughs, pointing out that he has the strength in banners: \nHouse Rowan\n, \nHouse Tarly\n,\nHouse Caron\n, \nHouse Tarth\n, \nHouse Penrose\n, \nHouse Fossoway\n, \nHouse Cuy\n, \nHouse Mullendore\n, \nHouse Estermont\n,\nHouse Selmy\n, \nHouse Hightower\n, \nHouse Oakheart\n, \nHouse Crane\n, \nHouse Caswell\n, \nHouse Blackbar\n, \nHouse Morrigen\n,\nHouse Beesbury\n, \nHouse Shermer\n, \nHouse Dunn\n, \nHouse Footly\n and Stannis' wife’s \nHouse Florent\n. What is present is\nonly the vanguard, with 100,000 foot still to arrive. After exchanging taunts, Stannis gallops away, the Red Priestess\nstaying long enough to say before also leaving:\nLook to your own sins, Lord Renly.\nCatelyn tells Renly that his brother is the lawful heir if Joffrey is Jaime’s son. Renly replies this is true only while he\nlives, and asks if Catelyn would agree that it is a fool’s law since he would be a better king than either Robert or\nStannis. He will be a great king:\nstrong yet generous, clever, just, diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of\nforgiveness, patient-\nCatelyn adds\n-humble?\nRenly laughs and states\nYou must allow a king some flaws, my lady.\nCatelyn feels very tired; she has failed, and her son will have to face the Lannisters alone while the Baratheon\nbrothers destroy each other. She thinks how much Renly is like his brother Robert, but Robert had Eddard to temper\nhim. Eddard would have prevailed on Robert to bring the whole force to besiege Stannis, the besieger, instead of\nforging ahead with only the horses and no fodder. Now he must come to battle soon or starve. Catelyn accompanies\nRenly back to his pavilion, sending Hal Mollen to tend to the horses.\nOnce inside, Renly states his brother has not changed, and since he will not take his gifts, maybe he should fight.\n\nLord \nMathis Rowan\n points out that the castle is well provisioned and has a strong garrison under Ser \nCortnay\nPenrose\n; they can let Stannis have a profitless siege. Renly, however, is concerned that men will say he fears\nStannis. Lord \nRandyll Tarly\n thinks they cannot leave him unblooded since he may grow stronger than Renly, and the\nothers seem to agree. Renly decides that they will fight. At this, Catelyn sees no point in not returning to Riverrun,\nso she asks to leave, but is told she cannot; she must watch so she can tell her son what happens to rebels.\nRenly then gives command of the center to Lord Mathis Rowan, the left to \nBryce Caron\n, and the reserve to Lord\nEldon Estermont\n, while Renly takes the right. Lord Mathis Rowan asks who will have the van, and Ser \nJon\nFossoway\n first asks the honor, but Ser \nGuyard the Green\n states that it should be one of the seven. \nRandyll Tarly\nstates he led \nMace Tyrell\n’s van since before most of those present were born. After a clamor fills the pavilion, Renly\ngives the honor to Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n. Ser Loras accepts and asks for one of his knights to ride beside him, so that the\nstag and rose can go to battle side by side. Renly gives Brienne this honor. She wants to fight by his side, but is told\nthat there are four of the \nRainbow Guard\n that will fight beside him. She accepts the duty, but requests that she arm\nhim for battle. Renly accepts. Catelyn can hear someone snigger. Renly then asks them to leave him.\nBefore she leaves, Catelyn asks to visit a sept she saw in a village, and Renly tells Ser \nRobar Royce\n to provide an\nescort, but to return by dawn. Catelyn tells him he should also pray, not for victory but for wisdom. Renly tells Ser\nLoras to remain with him to help him pray.\nSer Robar Royce is a member of the Rainbow guard and Catelyn knows him slightly, that he is known for his skill in\nthe tourney, the son of \nYohn Royce\n, bannerman to \nHouse Arryn\n. She asks him about this and he says his father owes\nfealty as does his heir, but he is a second son. He is tired of tourneys and looking for glory.\nShe arrives at her camp to find \nShadd\n preparing the meal, Hal Mollen dicing with three of his men, and \nLucas\nBlackwood\n sharpening his dagger. Lucas asks if they fight or flee, and she says they pray.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn II\n↑\nArya VII\n ←\nCatelyn III\n→ \nSansa III\n↓\nCatelyn IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 32: Sansa III\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa II\n↑\nCatelyn III\n ←\nSansa III\n→ \nCatelyn IV\n↓\nSansa IV\nSansa\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a0b288e13a6fce31c09ac1016967951fc0dcdcfd225cc6e7538dff5a5a814476_v2"}
