They decide that their word for going ahead with the plan\nwill be \"\nGroleo\n,\" in reference to the hostage that was slain by the \nYunkai'i\n. Skahaz reveals that he was present in the\nthrone room when \nBloodbeard\n and the slaver lords made their insult, and that he and every one of the \nBrazen Beasts\npresent would have killed the Yunkish delegation in an instant had Hizdahr given the command, raging that the\nYunkish would never have dared do such a thing to Daenerys. The Shavepate goes on to explain to Ser Barristan\nthat Hizdahr's horrified reaction to Groleo's severed head was a sham and the slavers couldn't care less about\nYurkhaz zo Yunzak\n's death in the pit; the whole thing was arranged so as to give Hizdahr a pretext to kill the queen's\ndragons\n before \nVolantis\n's fleet arrives.\nDespite Skahaz's objections, Barristan insists that after Hizdahr is deposed, they will order the Yunkai'i return their\nremaining hostage and withdraw their armies from \nMeereen\n, only going forth to do battle if they refuse. Selmy is\nalso confident he can overcome Hizdahr's guards, as they are only pit fighters and Barristan believes men like that,\nwho fight for the adulation of the crowd and only when they are called to, are no match for a knight of the\nKingsguard\n who must always be alert and ready to fight and die at a moment's notice to defend their monarch.\nBarristan and Skahaz also dispute over trying to rescue the remaining hostages—\nJhogo\n, \nHero\n and \nDaario\n—as the\nShavepate believes it is too dangerous to try. He is also particularly scathing about Daario, believing it would be\nbetter in the long run for Daenerys if the \nStormcrows\n's captain were to die. Though he is aware Daenerys is in love\nwith Daario, Barristan privately agrees as he is well aware from history that the \nTargaryens\n have a propensity for\nchoosing poorly in matters of the heart, choices that almost always lead to disaster:\nPrine \nRhaegar\n loved his Lady \nLyanna\n and \nthousands died for it\n. \nDaemon Blackfyre\n loved the \nfirst Daenerys\n,\nand rose in \nrebellion\n when denied her. \nBittersteel\n and \nBloodraven\n both loved \nShiera Seastar\n and the Seven\nKingdoms bled. The \nPrince of Dragonflies\n loved \nJenny of Oldstones\n so much he cast aside a crown, and\nWesteros paid the bride price in corpses. All three of the sons of the \nfifth Aegon\n had wed for love in defiance of\ntheir father's wishes. And because that unlikely monarch had followed his heart when he chose his queen, he\nallowed his sons to have their way, making bitter enemies when he might have made fast friends. Treason and\nturmoil followed, as night follows day, ending at \nSummerhall\n in sorcery, fire and grief.\nSkahaz also mentions that they have hostages of their own and that they can easily retaliate in kind if the Yunkai'i\nharm any more of their hostages, but like his queen, Barristan refuses to harm the cupbearers, due to his own\naversion to killing children. Though disappointed, the Shavepate agrees and promises that everything will be ready\nfor the plan by nightfall.\nFor the rest of the day, Barristan makes his rounds about \nthe pyramid\n and trains with his boys. He thinks to himself\nthat some of them might be ready for \nknighthood\n soon. However, as he wrestles with what he is planning to do that\nnight, he decides it would be worse for the boys if they were knighted by an knight without honour just before his\ndeath. He lectures the boys about honor and thinks that someday maybe they will understand. He also warns\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ<|>PERSON<|>Yezzan zo Qaggaz is a character whose men have slaughtered
