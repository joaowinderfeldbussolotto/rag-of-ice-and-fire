Ser\nBoros explains that preparations for \nTyrek Lannister\n's wedding feast have convinced some wretches that they should\nfeast, too. He adds that Joffrey led a sortie that sent the fools scurrying. Clegane states, \"A brave boy,\" but Sansa\nwonders how brave Joffrey will be when he faces her brother \nRobb\n.\nAfter crossing the drawbridge, Sansa asks why the Hound lets people call him a dog but never a knight. He replies\nthat he likes dogs better, and explains that his grandfather was a kennelmaster at \nCasterly Rock\n who received lands\nand a \ntowerhouse\n for saving Lord \nTytos Lannister\n from a \nlion\n, losing a leg and three dogs in the process. He adds\nthat a dog will die for you and never lie to you, which is more than little birds can do. When he adds that he never\ngot his song, Sansa suggests a song about Florian and Jonquil. The Hound dismisses it as a song about a fool and his\ncunt, but insists he will have a song from her one day, whether she wants to or not. Sansa replies she will sing for\nhim gladly, but Clegane retorts,\nPretty thing, and such a bad liar. A dog can smell a lie, you know.

The village\nturns out to be occupied by Ser \nGregor Clegane\n and his \nmen\n, and Gendry is captured. During a rescue attempt, \nHot\nPie\n panics, leading to Arya's capture as well. Later, \na spearman\n kills \nLommy\n rather than carry him.\nSynopsis\nFrom high in a tree, Arya can see a fishing village with some smoking chimneys. It is the first sign of life since they\nfled the \nholdfast\n; the \nLannisters\n have burned or killed everything. The houses promise warmth and shelter, unless it\nis Ser \nAmory Lorch\n there. Arya watches for a long time, trying to be sure, but it is too far to see for certain.\nArya and the others waited until the next night to return to the burnt village. \nHot Pie\n and \nLommy\n were still afraid,\nbut Lorch and his men were long gone. The holdfast was strewn with corpses from both sides, and scavengers had\nbeen at them. One look was enough for \nGendry\n, but Arya insisted they find \nYoren\n, telling herself he could not be\ndead. They found his body next to four Lannister men-at-arms, and Arya wondered how many men it took to bring\nthe black brother down. There were too many bodies to bury everyone, but Arya insisted Yoren must have a grave,\nand as they dug part of her wanted to cry and part of her wanted to kick Yoren.\nThe only other survivors were \nCutjack\n, \nKurz\n, and \nTarber\n, who had been on look-out in the towerhouse. They came\nunder attack as well, but the stone tower was inflammable and inaccessible with the ladder pulled up, so Lorch's men\nleft them. When Kurz decided they would do better continuing north, Arya clung to the hope of still reaching\nWinterfell\n, but Kurz took an arrow in the shoulder pulling up the towerhouse ladder and, despite Tarber treating it\nwith mud and moss, the wound festered and killed him. Soon after, Tarber and Cutjack had taken the dead poacher's\nweapons and hunting horn when they abandoned them. Afterward, wanting no part of any roads, Arya and the others\nmade their way up the muddy shore of \nGod's Eye\n, taking turns carrying Lommy on a makeshift litter, since the spear\nwound in his calf is now so bad he cannot walk.\nFrom her tree, Arya sees that the air over the village is full of crows, but thirty yards from shore three black swans\nglide serenely over the water, oblivious to the war. Part of Arya wants to be one of them, but the other part wants to\neat one. She and the others have been living mostly on an awful-tasting acorn paste Kurz taught them to make,\nthough Arya and \nWeasel\n (their new name for the crying girl) have also been eating bugs and worms. Arya even tried\ncatching fish with her hands as \nKoss\n once did, but without success.\nBeneath Arya's tree, Hot Pie barks like a dog to signal her, an old poacher's trick Kurz taught them. With the\nnimbleness of a \nwater dancer\n, Arya returns to the ground to report her findings. Hot Pie opines that they should go to\nthe village\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYREK LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Lannister family whose wedding feast preparations are mentioned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>A prince who led a sortie and is mentioned in relation to Sansa and Robb Stark)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>A character who interacts with the Hound and reflects on Joffrey's bravery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBB<|>PERSON<|>Sansa's brother, referenced as someone Joffrey might face)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HOUND<|>PERSON<|>A character who discusses his past and interacts with Sansa, also known as Sandor Clegane)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTERLY ROCK<|>GEO<|>The ancestral home of House Lannister, where the Hound's grandfather worked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYTOS LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>A former Lord of Casterly Rock saved by the Hound's grandfather)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl traveling with companions, later captured by Gregor Clegane's men)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDRY<|>PERSON<|>A companion of Arya who is captured by Gregor Clegane's men)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT PIE<|>PERSON<|>A companion of Arya who panics during a rescue attempt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOMMY<|>PERSON<|>A companion of Arya who is killed by a spearman)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREGOR CLEGANE<|>PERSON<|>A knight who captures Gendry and Arya, also known as the Mountain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMORY LORCH<|>PERSON<|>A Lannister commander who attacked a holdfast and left corpses behind)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOREN<|>PERSON<|>A black brother whose body is found by Arya and her companions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUTJACK<|>PERSON<|>A survivor who abandoned Arya and her group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KURZ<|>PERSON<|>A survivor who died from a festered wound)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARBER<|>PERSON<|>A survivor who treated Kurz's wound and later abandoned the group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEASEL<|>PERSON<|>A crying girl traveling with Arya, renamed by the group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSS<|>PERSON<|>A person mentioned in relation to fishing techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODS EYE<|>GEO<|>A large lake near a village where Arya and her companions travel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The ancestral home of House Stark, where Arya hopes to reach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLDFAST<|>GEO<|>A fortified location attacked by Amory Lorch and his men)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOWERHOUSE<|>GEO<|>A structure where survivors took refuge during an attack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VILLAGE WEST OF THE GODS EYE<|>GEO<|>A fishing village observed by Arya from a tree)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYREK LANNISTER<|>JOFFREY<|>Tyrek Lannister's wedding feast is mentioned in the context of Joffrey's actions<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOFFREY<|>SANSA<|>Joffrey is discussed by Sansa in relation to his bravery and her brother Robb<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>THE HOUND<|>Sansa interacts with the Hound, discussing his past and his views on lies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE HOUND<|>TYTOS LANNISTER<|>The Hound's grandfather saved Tytos Lannister, earning lands and a towerhouse<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>GENDRY<|>Arya and Gendry are companions who are captured together by Gregor Clegane's men<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>HOT PIE<|>Arya and Hot Pie are companions who travel together and attempt a rescue<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>LOMMY<|>Arya and Lommy are companions, with Lommy being carried due to injury<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREGOR CLEGANE<|>GENDRY<|>Gregor Clegane captures Gendry during a raid on a village<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREGOR CLEGANE<|>HOT PIE<|>Gregor Clegane's men capture Hot Pie and Arya during a rescue attempt<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMORY LORCH<|>HOLDFAST<|>Amory Lorch attacked the holdfast, leaving corpses behind<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>YOREN<|>Arya insists on burying Yoren, showing her respect for him<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>GODS EYE<|>Arya travels along the shore of God's Eye with her companions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Arya hopes to reach Winterfell, her family's home<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KURZ<|>TARBER<|>Kurz and Tarber were survivors who treated wounds and later abandoned the group<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WEASEL<|>Arya and Weasel are companions who eat bugs and worms together<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
