Janos reveals that he will give Jon one last chance to prove his innocence,\nsending him to meet \nMance Rayder\n as an envoy, but Jon must kill the \nwildling\n king. \nBeyond the Wall\n, Jon meets\nTormund\n who treats him with respect, almost as a friend. Jon is brought before Mance, and the king reveals that he\nis aware that the \nNight's Watch\n is nearly out of provisions and cannot hold out much longer.\nRayder then brings him to see the \nHorn of Winter\n, which Mance claims they found back in the \nFrostfangs\n, but only\nhe and his trusted lieutenants knew about it. However, Mance does not wish to use the Horn, for if the songs can be\nbelieved, it will cause the Wall to collapse. The wildlings have come south not to conquer, but to escape the \nOthers\n.\nWithout the Wall, Mance’s people would find no safe haven, even in the south, and that is something he does not\nwish to happen. Mance offers Jon the Horn of Winter if the Night’s Watch will let his people pass the Wall and\nsettle the lands to the south, although he will not abide the laws or taxes of the \nSeven Kingdoms\n. If the Watch\nrefuses, Tormund Giantsbane will sound the \nHorn of Joramun\n in three days time.\nHowever, the parley is interrupted, as the wildlings have \ncome under attack\n from the east by rangers from\nEastwatch\n. Mance believes that it must be \nCotter Pyke\n, but a scout and \nVaramyr\n, who is skinchanged inside \nOrell\n's\neagle, tell Mance there are more iron-clad attackers coming from the north and east. When Orell's eagle bursts into\nflames, Varamyr runs screaming from the fray. \nHarma Dogshead's\n raiders charge through the rangers, but they are\noverwhelmed by \nknights\n on heavy horse. Amongst their banners, Jon sees a \nseahorse\n, a \nfield of birds\n, and a \nring of\nflowers\n. Mance is surrounded and captured, and Harma's head is waved on a pole. After hearing the knights shout\n\"\nStannis\n!\", Jon enters Mance’s tent where \nDalla\n is giving birth with the assistance of \nVal\n.\nNavigation:\nJon IX\n↑\nJaime IX\n ←\nJon X\n→ \nArya XIII\n↓\nJon XI\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 74: Arya XIII\nPlace(s): \nInn at the Crossroads\n - \nSaltpans\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya XII\n↑\nJon X\n ←\nArya XIII\n→ \nSamwell IV\n↓\nA Feast for Crows\nArya I\nSynopsis\nSandor\n and \nArya\n come to the \nInn at the Crossroads\n. To her dismay, she recognizes \nPolliver\n and the \nTickler\n and \na\nsquire\n. The squire tries to bait Sandor with insults about fleeing King's Landing and the room is very tense. The\nHound demands wine, which the innkeeper brings and Sandor gulps down. Sandor warns the innkeeper that Polliver\nand the Tickler will kill him instead of paying for their drinks, and the innkeeper and the other people in the room\nleave.\nThe \nTickler\n tells Sandor what has happened in the realm, including \nTyrion's\n marriage, \nJoffrey's\n death and Tyrion's\nimprisonment. He claims that \nSansa's\n sister has been found and is to marry \nRamsay Bolton\n, \nHarrenhal\n has been\ntaken by \nGregor Clegane\n, \nRiverrun\n is under siege by the \nLannisters\n and \nRandyll Tarly\n has taken \nSaltpans\n. He says\nonly the Blackwoods are still holding out, and the Brackens are fighting them around \nRaventree Hall\n.\nThe Tickler says Gregor would prefer that Sandor come back with them to Harrenhal, but when Sandor refuses, the\nTickler throws a knife at him. Sandor, the Tickler and Polliver all draw swords and begin to fight. The squire tries to\njoin in but Arya throws a cup at him and knocks him down. Sandor is not fighting his best and Arya realizes he\ndrank his wine too fast and is drunk. During the fight Arya stabs the squire in the belly and then sneaks up behind\nthe Tickler and stabs him over and over again in a rage until Sandor stops her. The squire is still alive but was\nmortally wounded and asks for mercy.
