She drank too much wine last night, she thinks. She now recognizes \nJocelyn Swyft\n, Ser\nOsmund Kettleblack\n and Ser \nBoros Blount\n and notices \nLannister\n guards, while she is being handed lemon water to\nwaken her up. She wonders whether the news can be true, insisting that her father is surrounded by guards day and\nnight. Ser Osmund tells her the guards were on their post, but a secret passage has been found behind a hearth in the\nHand's Tower\n and Jaime has gone in to inspect it. Cersei is worried about Jaime's safety as well as of \nTommen\n's, but\nshe is told that guards supervised by Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n have been assigned to watch over the King. This stirs up her\nresentment against the \nTyrells\n and she wonders whether the murder was their doing, yet does not dare to speak this\naloud. She commands Ser Osmund to escort her to the Tower of the Hand and Ser Boros to make certain that Tyrion\nis still in his cell. She doesn't believe Tyrion would dare to raise a hand against their father, but needs to be certain.\nOutside, the sun is beginning to rise while the stars can still be seen, making Cersei think that the great star of the\nwest has fallen. Ser Osmund tells her that \nLum\n, one of the guards, found the body in the privy. She already feels the\nhole left by Lord Tywin and decides to act swiftly as she suspects there will be attempts to push her aside, as always.\nShe wonders whether \nStannis Baratheon\n is behind the murder. She enters the tower, thinking that not crying makes\nher the only true son her father ever had. Climbing the many stairs to the Hand's chambers prompts her to think\nabout tearing the tower down. As she enters the hall, she finds the room full of guards and servants, whispering\namong themselves. Cersei resents their presence as well as the fact that she was not called first. She orders Ser\nMeryn Trant\n to show the people out and is informed that her father's body has been brought to his bed. When she\nenters the bedchamber, guards are present again as well as her distraught uncle \nKevan\n, kneeling by the bed and\ntrying to pray for his brother. She notices how small the door to the secret passage behind the hearth is, making her\nthink of Tyrion again, then settling for Stannis or the Tyrells as more likely suspects. She knows about the rumors of\nsecret passages in the \nRed Keep\n and that \nMaegor the Cruel\n supposedly killed the builders of the castle to keep them\nsecret. She thinks of other, yet undiscovered, secret passages to other bedchambers and has a vision of Tyrion using\none to get to Tommen.\nCersei has a look at her father's half-naked body. While reflecting on how he looks much older and smaller than\nwhen he was alive, she already notices a smell emanating from the corpse. She is furious that the quarrel that killed\n\nLord Tywin has been left in his stomach and orders it to be removed. Cersei wonders whether she should act\ndesperate and claw her own face, as she heard \nCatelyn Stark\n did when her son \nRobb\n was killed before her eyes, and\nwonders how Lord Tywin once received news of his \nown father's\n death. She commands that the bells must toll for\nher father just as they did for \nKing Robert\n. She asks for \nPycelle\n and wants him to prepare the body, but is told that\nthe \nGrand Maester\n has already been there and left again. This angers her more because of Pycelle's uselessness in\nold age and she calls for Maesters \nBallabar\n and \nFrenken\n instead. Cersei asks about Jaime and is again told he's down\nin the secret passage, inspecting the depth of a shaft found there. She is worried about his safety, thinking of his lost\nhand and how the murderer might await him in the dark.\nQyburn\n is shown in, offering his service as maester. He informs her that he treated Jaime's hand and she remembers\nthat he came down from \nHarrenhal\n with her brother. She notices that he doesn't have a maester's chain, receiving the\nanswer that it has been taken away by the \nCitadel\n while his knowledge is still there. She orders him to remove the\nquarrel and prepare her father's body for the silent sisters. Qyburn asks her what he should do with the girl. Cersei\nhas not noticed the second body in the bed before and takes a look at her naked body, observing the golden chain\naround her neck and that her face is as black as \nJoffrey's\n was when he died. She is furious and demands to know\nwhat the girl is doing there, receiving the unsatisfying answer that she has been found where she is and that she was\nTyrion's whore. She thinks that Lord Tywin never used whores and defensively tells a guard how he treated his own\nfather's mistress after his death, parading her naked through the streets of \nLannisport\n. Qyburn suggests that Lord\nTywin might have been questioning the girl about her mistress \nSansa Stark\n's disappearance. Cersei eagerly seizes on\nthis notion but has a vision of Tyrion mocking\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2693299ef1f09d6ae5f1e7d703feda3f3a4c5c3228cc9cfe98d9e96c5c30913d_v2"}
