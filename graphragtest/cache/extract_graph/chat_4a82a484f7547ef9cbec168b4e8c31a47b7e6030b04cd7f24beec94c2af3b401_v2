Ser \nJaime\n will not\naccede, though he is sorely tempted since Edmure betrayed his concessions by helping his uncle, Ser \nBrynden\n, to\nescape the castle when he turned it over to the \nLannisters\n. Despite a massive search for Lord \nHoster\n's brother, Jaime\nknows the Blackfish will not be found, nor will he abandon the fight. Before being escorted west to \nCasterly Rock\n as\na noble prisoner, Ser Edmure speaks his mind, \"You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room,\nKingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you.\"\nLater, Lady \nSybell Westerling\n and her daughter, the widowed Queen \nJeyne Stark\n, are brought before Jaime. Jeyne is\nin mourning for her husband and defiant to her mother, but when Sybell moves to slap her, Jaime intervenes and\nkindly asks Jeyne to leave the solar. Jaime confirms to Lady Sybell that House Westerling has its pardon, her brother\nhas been named Lord of Castamere and marriages will be arranged for her daughters, though Jeyne will have to wait\ntwo years before marrying again, to prevent rumours that any children she has are actually \nRobb Stark\n's. Lady\nSybell asks Jaime to inquire after her son, Ser \nRaynald\n, who accompanied Robb to \nthe Twins\n, and had no\nknowledge of the arrangement between his mother and \nTywin Lannister\n. Jaime, suspecting that Raynald is likely\ndead as Walder Frey also didn't know of the arrangement, agrees to inquire, promising that House Lannister will pay\nhis ransom if Raynald is held captive. She then mentions that Lord Tywin promised a high-born marriage for him,\n\"that Raynald should have joy of him\". When Jaime states that \nJoy\n is his uncle \nGerion\n's natural daughter, Sybell\nshouts, \"You want a Westerling to marry a bastard?\". Jaime, desiring to strangle the woman with her own necklace,\nretorts \"No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch. Your daughter is worth ten of\nyou, my lady. You'll leave with Edmure and Ser \nForley\n on the morrow. Until then, you would do well to stay out of\nmy sight.\" He then contemplates how much Lord \nGawen\n knew of his wife's schemes.\nThe following morning, Jaime warns Ser Forley Prester to guard Ser Edmure well, for fear either the Blackfish or\nBeric Dondarrion\n might try to free him. The knight is aware of his orders to kill Edmure should he try to slip away.\nJaime adds that he should do the same for Jeyne Stark, stating that she is twice as dangerous as Edmure, should she\nescape. Jaime then visits \nEdwyn Frey\n, who is preparing his army to return to the Twins. Edwyn divulges that his\nfather, Ser \nRyman\n, along with his entire retinue, were hanged by Lady \nStoneheart\n near \nFairmarket\n. Although Edwyn\nblames Jaime, the Lord Commander is well aware that Edwyn couldn't care less that his father is dead. And although\nEdwyn is now heir to the Twins, Jaime knows that \nBlack Walder\n will probably soon move to kill his brother. Jaime's\nonly real concern is that the \noutlaws\n must be getting bolder if they are willing to kill Lord Walder's heir only a day's\nride from the Twins. Jaime takes his leave after inquiring about Ser Raynald's fate. Apparently, Queen Jeyne's\nbrother was responsible for loosing \nGrey Wind\n on the Freys, and was shot full of quarrels before diving into the\nriver. An offhand comment from Jaime about killing those responsible makes the Freys drop their smug attitude\nabout the act.\nContent that he has taken \nRiverrun\n without having to take up arms against the \nTullys\n or \nStarks\n, Jaime later agrees to\nallow Ser \nDesmond Grell\n and Ser \nRobin Ryger\n to \ntake the black\n, commanding \nRaff the Sweetling\n to escort them to\nMaidenpool\n. During Lord Emmon's speech to the people of Riverrun, Jaime speaks with the singer he took from\nRyman Frey earlier. He reveals himself as \nTom of Sevenstreams\n, and tells Jaime that he hopes to play for Lady\n\nGenna\n and Lord Emmon over the winter. That night, Jaime dreams of his mother, Lady \nJoanna\n, whom he barely\nremembers, but the dream disturbs him when his mother cries and asks who he really is. In the morning, Maester\nVyman\n delivers \nCersei\n's message written by \nQyburn\n. The old maester asks if Jaime wishes to respond, but the\nKingsguard hands the letter to \nPeck\n, saying, \"No. Put this in the fire.\"\nNavigation:\nJaime VI\n↑\nCersei X\n ←\nJaime VII\n→ \nSamwell V\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nJaime I\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 45: Samwell V\nPlace(s): \nOldtown\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell IV\n↑\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4a82a484f7547ef9cbec168b4e8c31a47b7e6030b04cd7f24beec94c2af3b401_v2"}
