When day has come, Daenerys holds court, where the last petitioner presents\nher with a terrible\nSynopsis\nDaenerys Targaryen\n, now riling \nMeereen\n as its Queen, is presented the body of \nStalwart Shield\n, one of her \nUnsullied\nsoldiers. Stalwart Shield was killed by the \nSons of the Harpy\n when he was visiting a brothel. He was found with the\ngenitals of a goat stuffed down his throat, and with his sword missing. Daenerys notes that, although the Harpy's\nSons have killed to freedmen loyal to her before, Stalwart is the first of her soldiers to be killed. Ser \nBarristan\nSelmy\n, \nLord Commander of her Queensguard\n, warns her that Stalwart will not be the last. Daenerys offers a reward\nfor anyone who can return the missing sword, and orders her men to investigate who has been gelding goats\nrecently. Barristan informs her that the Unsullied are ill-suited to find the murderers, but Daenerys sees them as her\nonly option, as the \nDothraki\n, who would fare far worse, are gone from the city, attempting to subdue the hinterlands,\nas are her \nSecond Sons\n and \nStormcrows\n, the former gone south to guard Meereen against possible attacks from\nYunkai\n, the latter to the east to make an alliance with the \nLhazareen\n.\nFrom the terrace of her private chambers in the \nGreat Pyramid\n, Daenerys looks out over the city as dawn breaks. Her\ndragon \nViserion\n looks at her as she walks by, and takes off into the sky as Daenerys watches him go. She notes that\nher dragons have been growing larger and wilder, and wonders if she has left them too much to themselves. She\nthinks they are almost large enough to ride.\nWhen Viserion is out of sight, she returns to her chambers and dons a \ntokar\n. On her way to hold court, she is met by\nReznak mo Reznak\n, her \nseneschal\n, and \nSkahaz mo Kandaq\n. They have heard what happened to Stalwart Shield.\nSkahaz, a Meereenese nobleman who has \"put the old Meereen behind him to accept the new\", symbolized by him\nshaving his head, thereby exchanging the customary Meereenese hair styles for a bald head. He and his followers,\n\"the shavepates\", are regarded as enemies by the Harpy's Sons. Skahaz is convinced that the noble Meereenese slave\nfamilies are behind the attack, and suggests killing one man of each family now, and two of each of these families\nthe next time one of her soldiers is killed. Reznak is horrified by the suggestion, and insists that the murderer will\nprove to be baseborn. Daenerys orders them to increase the reward offered for a Harpy's Son, and leaves to hold\ncourt.\nThe first petitioner is the \nAstapori\n envoy, Lord \nGhael\n. He presents Daenerys with a present from \nAstapor\n's new king,\nCleon\n. Ghael has asked Daenerys for her hand in marriage in Cleon's name several times before, but today he\nproposes Astapor and Meereen form an alliance against \nYunkai\n. Daenerys regrets having left Yunkai untaken, as the\nYellow City had resumed to slavery as soon as she had moved on. However, she also finds that Cleon is little better\nthan the Yunkai'i, as he has enslaved the former slave masters. She suggests to the ambassador that King Cleon\nshould feed the people in his starving city before sending them out into war.\nThe next petitioner is \nHizdahr zo Loraq\n, a wealthy Meereenese noble. For the sixth time, Daenerys refuses to grant\nhim his wish of opening the fighting pits of \nMeereen\n. Daenerys recalls that Reznak and the \nGreen Grace\n have been\n\nurging her to take a Meereenese noble for her husband in order to reconcile the city to her rule. Daenerys thinks that\nHizdahr might be an option. She recalls how Skahaz had offered to wed her, expressing willingness to set aside his\nwife to do so. However, Daenerys does not like the notion.\nSeveral other petitioners follow, many of them presenting Daenerys with grievances about deeds done during the\nsack of the city. A young boy tells her how two of his father's houseshold slaves had killed his father and older\nbrother, and raped and killed his mother. He request they be hanged, but Daenerys has to deny him, as she had\ndeclared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack, and will not punish slaves for rising up against\ntheir masters. The boy attempts to attack her upon hearing her decision, but fails when he trips on his own tokar\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a665e5d1c23ecb08dfb24f994a4d3efdc87a1b7f56126841e40a8aca46a47722_v2"}
