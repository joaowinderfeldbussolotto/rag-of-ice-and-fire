Talk of\nwarships piques Bran's interest and he thinks it a splendid idea, but no one asks him. The meeting continues through\nlunch, during which Lord Wyman inquires about his widowed cousin Lady \nDonella Hornwood\n, whose \nhusband\n and\nonly son\n died on the \nGreen Fork\n and in the \nWhispering Wood\n. He suggests that he would be interested in marrying\nher, or she could wed his son Ser \nWendel\n. Later, Lord Wyman informs them that \nTywin Lannister\n has offered to\nransom his son Ser \nWylis\n (who was taken captive on the Green Fork) if he withdraws his support for King \nRobb\n. He\nhas of course refused, but hopes for an equitable prisoner exchange as soon as possible.\nLady Hornwood arrives during supper, and Bran expresses his condolences to the grief-stricken widow. She thanks\nthem, but asks leave to rest and continue the next day. The next morning's talk is devoted to preparations for the\ncoming winter until Lady Hornwood warns them that \nRoose Bolton\n's bastard son \nRamsay Snow\n is massing men at\n\nthe Dreadfort\n and refuses to explain his purpose. When Ser Rodrik says he does not know the man, Lady Hornwood\nexplains that Ramsay lived with his mother until \nDomeric Bolton\n died and left Roose without an heir. She adds that\nRamsay brought along an equally-cruel servant named \nReek\n who is said to never bathe. The two hunt together, and\nnot for deer, and there are other tales that are hard to believe even of a Bolton.\nLady Hornwood fears Ramsay covets her lands now that her husband and son are gone. Bran wants to give her a\nhundred men, but Ser Rodrik only promises to protect her lands and adds that in time it may be prudent for her to\nwed again. She remarks that she is beyond childbearing age yet attracts more suitors than ever. She promises to\nmarry if commanded, but there is no one to her liking. She points out that Lord Manderly is too big to share a bed\nwith or lie underneath; Bran knows that men sleep on top of their wives, and imagines sleeping under Lord Wyman\nwould be like sleeping under a horse. Ser Rodrik sympathizes and promises to look for a suitor more to Lady\nHornwood's taste, at which point she hints interest in Ser Rodrik himself.\nAfter she leaves, Maester Luwin points out Lady Hornwood's hint, which makes Ser Rodrik uncomfortable. Bran\nnotes that she is sad; Ser Rodrik adds that she is also gentle and not unattractive, but still a threat to the realm. Bran\nis incredulous, but the maester explains that without a direct heir there will be many claims to her lands, which Robb\nmust adjudicate as the liege lord. When Bran suggests Ser Rodrik, the old castellan replies that he is only a knight\nand too old; when he dies the problem would resurface. Thinking of his own half-brother, Bran next suggests Lord\nHornwood's twelve-year-old bastard \nLarence Snow\n. Ser Rodrik doubts that will please Lady Hornwood, but Maester\nLuwin insists they consider it.\nBran asks to be excused and Ser Rodrik agrees, saying he did well. There are still a few hours of daylight, so Bran\ngoes to the godswood to visit Summer. He has Hodor take him to his favorite place by the pool near the \nheart tree\n.\nSuddenly, a naked \nOsha\n explodes out of the cold pool, startling everyone. When Bran asks about the cold, Osha says\nshe likes it. She notices Bran staring at her and asks if he has never seen a naked woman. Bran has bathed with his\nsisters and seen serving women bathing, but Osha is hard and covered in scars, which she tells him were earned\nfighting men, mostly \nNight's Watch\n; she even killed one. Then she mentions overhearing that the Walders mocked\nHodor. Bran recalls that Hodor never fights and says that \nSepton\n \nChayle\n says Hodor has a gentle spirit. Osha replies\nthat Little Walder is well named: big outside, little inside, and mean to the bones. Then she asks if Bran has had any\nmore wolf dreams. When he say no, Osha declares a prince should lie better and begs his leave before hurrying back\nto the kitchens.\nThat night, Bran dreams of a \nweirwood\n calling to him and a \nthree-eyed crow\n pecking at his face. He wakes to\nclamor of the arrival of the \nUmbers\n from beyond the \nLast River\n. The next day, he greets their leaders, two of\nGreatjon Umber\n's uncles: \nMors Umber\n (known as \"Crowfood\" because he lost an eye to a crow that thought him\ndead), and \nHother Umber\n (known as \"Whoresbane\" for reasons no one will tell Bran). Mors immediately asks to\nwed Lady Hornwood; Luwin and Rodrik explain she is grieving but promise to consider it. Hother asks for\nlongships to stop \nwildling\n raids across the \nBay of Seals\n; Ser Rodrik recommends Hothor cooperate with Lord\nManderly to provide lumber and receive shipwrights and sailors.\nDuring the audience, the steward of \nDeepwood Motte\n arrives with apologies from Lady \nSyb\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1423d5bac54cb940d343d8d03986d8cd6616c8f8152cef57e6844e93da197e32_v2"}
