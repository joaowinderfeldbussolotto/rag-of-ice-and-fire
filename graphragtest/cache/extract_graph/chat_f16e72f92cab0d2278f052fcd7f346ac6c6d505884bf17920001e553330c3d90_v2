Although his mother Lady\nGenna\n is sister to Lord \nTywin Lannister\n, Ser Cleos has inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of\nhis father, Ser \nEmmon Frey\n.\nRobb's sword glimmers faintly as he bids Ser Cleos to rise, but it is \nGrey Wind\n who frightens the knight. As big as\nany elkhound, Robb's \ndirewolf\n sniffs at Ser Cleos, who was captured in the \nWhispering Wood\n where Grey Wind\nkilled half a dozen men. Ser Cleos scrambles to his feet and away from the direwolf so quickly that it provokes\nlaughter from the audience. Ser Cleos thanks Robb, calling him “my lord,” but \nGreatjon Umber\n corrects that a king\nis styled “Your Grace.” Ser Cleos accepts the correction, and Catelyn notes that he truly is more \nFrey\n than Lannister;\nthey would never have gotten such an honorific out of \nJaime Lannister\n.\nRobb wishes Ser Cleos to be his envoy to Queen \nCersei\n in \nKing's Landing\n. Robb reminds Ser Cleos that he\nconsiders him a Lannister, not a Frey, since he sided with the Lannisters in the Whispering Wood. He therefore\nexpects Ser Cleos to return with the queen's reply and resume his captivity. Ser Cleos vows on his \nknighthood\n to do\nso, and asks what the message is. Robb offers to make peace if his if his terms are met. At the back of the hall, Lord\nRickard Karstark\n shoves through a rank of guards and out the door, but Robb pays no attention. Exchanging his\nsword for a parchment, Robb reads his terms:\nFirst, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King's Landing to \nWhite\nHarbor\n. It is to be understood that \nSansa\n's betrothal to \nJoffrey Baratheon\n is at an end. When I receive word\nfrom my \ncastellan\n that my sisters have returned unharmed to \nWinterfell\n, I will release the queen's cousins, the\nsquire \nWillem Lannister\n and your brother \nTion Frey\n, and give them safe escort to \nCasterly Rock\n or\nwheresoever she desires them delivered.\nSecondly, my \nlord father\n's bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his \nbrother\n and \nsister\n in the crypts\n\nbeneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his\nservice at King's Landing must also be returned.\nThird, my father's greatsword \nIce\n will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun.\nFourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine\nthat he took captive in the \nbattle on the Green Fork\n of the \nTrident\n. Once he does so, I shall release my own\ncaptives taken in the Whispering Wood and the \nBattle of the Camps\n, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will\nremain my hostage for his father's good behavior.\nLastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over \nthe north\n. Henceforth we\nare no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain shall include all the \nStark\nlands north of \nthe Neck\n, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded\nby the \nGolden Tooth\n to the west and the \nMountains of the Moon\n in the east.\nAfter a cheer from the Greatjon, Robb states he will provide a map of the new borders. He declares that Lord Tywin\nmust cease his raids and withdraw, King Joffrey must rescind all claims to Robb's lands and subjects, and the\nLannisters must deliver ten highborn hostages as a pledge of peace. Robb promises to release two hostages every\nyear so long as the pact is honored, but if it is not he will give Queen Cersei another Whispering Wood. To\nemphasize his point, Robb whistles and Grey Wind comes forward and snarls. The Greatjon raises another cheer and\nGrey Wind howls. When Ser Cleos agrees, Robb orders him to depart with Ser \nRobin Ryger\n at first light and\ndismisses the assembly.\nOut in the gallery, Catelyn compliments her son's performance, but notes that the theatrics with Grey Wind befit a\nboy more than a king. Robb only smiles and asks if she saw Ser Cleos' face. Catelyn replies that what she saw was\nRickard Karstark storming out. Robb admits he saw it as well. Catelyn's brother \nEdmure Tully\n comments that others\nmay agree with Lord Rickard, and asks how they can talk of peace while the Lannisters are still pillaging the\nRiverlands\n. He urges Robb to march on Lord Tywin at \nHarrenhal\n, but Robb insists he does not have the strength.\nEdmure points out that they only grow weaker sitting here.\nCatelyn snaps that it was Edmure's idea to permit the river lords to depart for their own lands. Edmure argues that he\ncannot command his lords to remain idle while their crops are\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f16e72f92cab0d2278f052fcd7f346ac6c6d505884bf17920001e553330c3d90_v2"}
