Littlefinger asks if they want time in a bed chamber\nbut Ned tells him that will not be necessary; he just needs a little time. Catelyn goes to Littlefinger and tells him that\nshe appreciates his efforts, and has found a brother that she thought she had lost. Ned is not so confident that\nLittlefinger can be trusted, but says nothing. After Littlefinger leaves, Ned gives Catelyn instructions for his\nbannermen to fortify \nMoat Cailin\n and to keep a careful watch over \nTheon Greyjoy\n in case \nhis father's\n \nfleet\n is needed.\nHe hopes it will not come to war and that Robert will believe him when he finds out what happened.  \nNavigation:\nEddard III\n↑\nJon III\n ←\nEddard IV\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nEddard V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 21: Tyrion III\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n↑\nEddard IV\n ←\nTyrion III\n→ \nArya II\n↓\nTyrion IV\nTyrion\n dines with high officers of the \nNight's Watch\n and promises \nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n that he will speak to\nthe \nking\n of their need. Afterwards, while paying a final visit to \nthe Wall\n, Tyrion meets \nJon Snow\n, who asks Tyrion\nto do what he can to help his brother \nBran\n.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n is dining with the high officers of the \nNight's Watch\n on his last night at \nCastle Black\n. \nLord Commander\nMormont\n proclaims Tyrion a cunning man and asks him if he must leave so soon, saying that \nthe Wall\n needs men\nlike him. Tyrion brushes off the suggestion with an offer to scour the \nSeven Kingdoms\n for dwarfs. An offended Ser\nAlliser Thorne\n claims that Tyrion mocks the Watch, but Tyrion counters that he is only mocking Ser Alliser. Thorne\ndemands that Tyrion make his japes with steel in hand. Tyrion replies that he already has steel in his hand: a fork,\nwhich he brandishes against Thorne in a mock attack. A roar of laughter rises from the other officers and Ser Alliser\nleaves in disgust.\nAfter claiming Ser Alliser’s meal as his spoils of victory, Tyrion comments that a man like Ser Alliser should be\nmucking out the stable, not drilling the recruits. Mormont takes the opportunity to complain about the quality of his\nmen; Ser Alliser is one of the few living knights to have taken the black. Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n goes on to explain that\nboth he and Thorne fought for King \nAerys II Targaryen\n during the \nSack of King's Landing\n and were forced to take\nthe black or be executed by Tyrion’s father, Lord \nTywin Lannister\n. Tyrion’s only comment is that his father is\nindeed very fond of heads on spikes.\nTyrion asks for more wine and \nBowen Marsh\n comments that he has a great thirst for a small man. \nMaester Aemon\nstates that Tyrion is a giant among them at the edge of the world. Tyrion, speechless at being called a giant, calls the\nmaester kind, which leaves the maester equally amused.\nWhen they retire to the fire, Mormont informs Tyrion that he will receive an escort as far as \nWinterfell\n. Tyrion soon\nrealizes that the Lord Commander is working his way up to asking a favor and so cuts right to it by asking if there is\nany way he can repay the Watch’s kindness. Mormont beseeches Tyrion to speak to King \nRobert\n about the condition\nof the Night’s Watch and its need for men. Mormont goes on to elaborate on the high rate of disappearance among\ntheir ranging parties, including Ser \nWaymar Royce\n and \nBenjen Stark\n. The Watch’s strength is now under a thousand\nmen, leaving only three men to guard each mile of the Wall. Then Mormont laments that he is old and there is no\none qualified to take over command because the Watch has become an army of sullen boys and old men. He has\nmaybe 20 men that can read, and fewer who can think or lead. Tyrion promises that he will tell the King, his father,\nand his brother but he knows that it will do no good.\nMormont then asks Tyrion how many winters he has seen. When Tyrion replies with nine, Mormont adds that they\nhave all been short. The long summer is ending and portents say a long winter is coming. When Tyrion suggest the\nfabled endless summer may have come, Mormont insists the days are already growing shorter. Mormont then\nconfides to Tyrion that the \nwildlings\n are massing and moving south, running scared from something worse than just\nthe cold. Tyrion, bored by Mormont’s dark words, reiterates his promises and leaves.\nOutside it is bitter cold. As he walks the castle ground, Tyrion is taken by a whim to climb the Wall one last time.\n\nHis legs are cramping too much to climb the stairs, so Tyrion takes the winch cage up. At the top he meets \nJon Snow\nwith \nGhost\n. As they walk, Tyrion asks how the recruits are doing under Jon’s instruction. Jon tells him that they are\ngetting better.\nTyrion offers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NED<|>PERSON<|>Eddard Stark, a nobleman
