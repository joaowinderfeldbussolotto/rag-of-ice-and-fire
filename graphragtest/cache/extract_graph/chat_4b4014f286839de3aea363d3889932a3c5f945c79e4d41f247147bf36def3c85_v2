Viserys finally realizes what is\nhappening and begins to plead and struggle. Ser Jorah tells Daenerys to look away, but she refuses. When the gold is\nhalf melted, Drogo declares “Crown for Cart King!” and upends the pot over Viserys’ head. Soon it is over; not a\ndrop of blood is spilled. Daenerys thinks, surprisingly calmly, that Viserys was no dragon, because fire cannot kill a\ndragon.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys IV\n↑\nEddard XII\n ←\nDaenerys V\n→ \nEddard XIII\n↓\nDaenerys VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 47: Eddard XIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard XII\n↑\nDaenerys V\n ←\nEddard XIII\n→ \nJon VI\n↓\nEddard XIV\nNed\n learns that King \nRobert\n has been mortally wounded by a boar. In his will, Robert declares Ned the \nRegent\n.\nAfterward, \nRenly Baratheon\n urges Ned to seize the royal children to secure his power, but Ned refuses. Ned writes a\nletter offering the throne to \nStannis Baratheon\n as the rightful heir. Reconsidering his need for men, Ned declares his\nintentions to \nLittlefinger\n and asks him to arrange the support of the \nCity Watch\n.\nSynopsis\nNed\n is dreaming of walking through the crypts beneath \nWinterfell\n. The \nKings of Winter\n watch him with eyes of ice\nand the \ndirewolves\n at their feet snarl. Finally, he comes to the tomb where \nhis father\n sleeps with \nLyanna\n and\nBrandon\n beside him. Lyanna's statue whispers, “Promise me, Ned,” and her eyes weep blood. Ned jerks awake with\nsomeone pounding at his door.\nThe king’s steward tells Ned that King \nRobert\n demands his presence at once. When Ned reaches \nMaegor's Holdfast\n,\nhe finds the \nKingsguard\n guarding the bridge, the steps, and the royal apartments. Ned only has to look at Ser\nBarristan Selmy\n, who is waiting outside the king’s bedchamber, to know something is terribly wrong.\nInside the bedchamber, he finds Robert in bed with \nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n, \nRenly Baratheon\n, and \nCersei Lannister\ngathered around him. The room smells of smoke, blood, and death. Tattered and blood-stained clothes litter the\nfloor. Ned can see that his friend is dying. Renly explains that it was a boar, and Robert curses himself for drinking\ntoo much wine and missing his thrust. When Ned asks where the rest of them were, Renly explains that Robert had\ncalled everyone off to try to take the boar himself. Ned lifts the blanket and verifies that they have done what they\ncan to close the rip from groin to nipple, but it is not nearly enough. The smell of death is horrible and\noverpowering; Robert declares that even he can smell it, but still takes pride in having killed the boar, which he\nwants served at his funeral feast.\nRobert then orders everyone but Ned to leave. Pycelle tries to give Robert the \nmilk of the poppy\n before leaving, but\nRobert refuses. Once they are gone, Ned damns Robert for being so headstrong. Robert damns Ned right back,\ndeclaring that he killed the boar and should have done the same to Ned for not leaving him to hunt in peace. He then\nadmits that Ned was right about \nDaenerys Targaryen\n and asserts the boar was sent by the gods to punish him. Robert\nthen expresses gratitude and admiration that Ned was the only one to tell him that he was wrong.\nRobert tells Ned to write his final testament, in which he names Ned as \nLord Regent\n and Protector of the Realm\nuntil his son comes of age. Ned cannot bring himself to tell Robert that \nJoffrey\n is not his son, so instead he\nclandestinely changes the words to “my heir,” feeling soiled as he does so. Ned tells Robert that he cannot die\nbecause the realm needs him, but Robert replies that the realm knows what a wretched king he was: as bad as \nAerys\n.\nNed insists that Robert was not as bad as Aerys and Robert declares that at least this one thing he did right: he has\ndeclared Ned as Regent and Ned will do it well. Robert signs the document and tells Ned that they are to serve the\nboar at his funeral feast. He then asks that Ned rescind the death warrant on Daenerys and also to help his son be\nbetter than he has been. Before Ned leaves, the king mumbles that he ought to laugh at being killed by a pig, but it\nhurts too much.\nThe queen has left, but the rest come back in. The king has Renly and Pycelle bear witness to his placing the seal on\n\nthe letter. Then the king asks for and drinks the milk of the poppy. As he fades off to sleep, he asks Ned if he will\ndream and Ned assures him he will. Then Robert declares that he will give Ned’s love to \nLyanna\n. Last of all, Robert\nrequests that Ned guard his children. Unable to tell the truth and unable to lie, all that Ned can think of is Robert’s\nbastards when he tells him that he will.\nPycelle tells Ned that he has done all that he can\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4b4014f286839de3aea363d3889932a3c5f945c79e4d41f247147bf36def3c85_v2"}
