When his elk died,\nColdhands butchered it for food, but all the steaks are gone now and they are all weak from hunger and cold,\nparticularly Jojen.\nThey have to make their way up the hill into a cleft - about a thousand yards through thick wood. But the \nOthers\n are\nclose by - Coldhand and his ravens can sense them, and an unnatural cold has descended, even as they remain\nunseen. The ravens urge Bran on so they start up the hill. Meera has to support Jojen's weight.\nAround eighty yards from the \ncave\n entrance, Summer stops at a steep stretch of unbroken snow. Bran, on Hodor's\nback, knows something is wrong. Coldhands continues to climb so Hodor follows him. He glimpses a fire in the\ncave entrance when suddenly Hodor trips and falls. A \nwight\n bursts from the snow, grasping his leg. Bran falls from\nhis basket as Hodor and the wight struggle, and soon he is surrounded by dead men emerging from under the snow\nwith pale flesh and black hands. Wights attack Coldhands as well, and Bran is grabbed as he tries to warn Jojen and\nMeera further down the slope. Summer tears off the arm and throat of the wight assaulting Bran and he begins to\ncrawl the 50 yards to the cave.\nBran enters the mind of Hodor to help him fight off the wights. Meera reaches him as he waves her up the hill and\ngrabs Jojen. Someone sets the wights on fire. Bran awakens in the cave before a \nchild of the forest\n. She takes them\ndown into the cave, but Coldhands cannot follow them due to the ward on the cave against dead things. They go\ndeeper, underneath roots and across a floor of bones, till they reach a skeletal body sitting on a throne made of roots\n- the \nthree-eyed crow\n, the last \ngreenseer\n.\nNavigation:\nBran I\n↑\nReek I\n ←\nBran II\n→ \nTyrion IV\n↓\nBran III\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 14: Tyrion IV\nPlace(s): \nRhoyne\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion III\n↑\nBran II\n ←\nTyrion IV\n→ \nDavos II\n↓\nTyrion V\nSynopsis\nAboard the \nShy Maid\n, \nGriff\n has banned \nTyrion\n, who is still playing the role of Hugor Hill, from drinking wine as\nthey journey down the \nRhoyne\n.
