Bran skinchanges into \nSummer\n frequently, and even into Hodor, although Hodor seems to\ndislike the experience. Coldhands is riding on an elk and is accompanied by ravens. \nJojen\n is becoming ill and weak.\nColdhands stops to deal with \"foes\" he refuses to name, backtracking while the others continue on. \nMeera\n points out\nthat they have never seen Coldhand's breath even in the icy weather - and he does not eat, or drink, or sleep. Bran\npoints out that Coldhands saved Sam and Gilly from \nwights\n, so they must trust him.\nBran enters Summer in order to find an abandoned wildling village for shelter. As they rest, Jojen refuses to eat\ndespite his weakness, telling his sister that this is not the day he dies. All four of them are near starving, but they\nrefrain from lighting a fire at Coldhand's instruction.\nSleepless, Bran enters Summer on the hunt, who has found the corpses of five men - and the wolf pack that found\nthem first. Summer/Bran squares off for a fight against \nthe leader\n of the pack, seeing in his eyes that he is in fact \na\nwarg\n like him. Bran/Summer defeats the pack leader, making the pack his and giving him the choice parts of the\ndead men. The dead men are in black - men of the \nNight's Watch\n.\nBran awakens to a fire - Coldhands has killed a pig for them, and as the dawn is near he allows them to light a fire to\nroast it. Bran asks Coldhands, who fears the flames, what happened to the foes. Coldhands replies that they will not\ntrouble him - he does not deny that they are dead at his hand. Only Jojen pays attention when Bran asks \nwho they\nwere\n - but he already knows they were men of the Night's Watch. Bran asks the ranger about his black hands, and he\ntells Bran that the blood runs into a man's extremities and congeals once he is dead. Meera demands to see his face,\nwhich he refuses. Bran notes that he could not pass beyond the Wall and its enchantments.\nMeera asks who the three-eyed crow is and he replies \n\"A friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will.

Illyrio explains that Tyrion and a sellsword called \nGriff\n will meet \nDaenerys\n in \nVolantis\n, while he remains\nto \"smooth the way\" for them in Pentos. Illyrio tells Tyrion that Daenerys has need of cunning men such as him, but\nTyrion is suspicious: why does Illyrio have a stake in helping Daenerys claim the \nIron Throne\n? Instead of\nanswering, the merchant tells of how when he first met her, Daenerys was young and fearful and her brother \nViserys\nwas foolish and greedy, and Mopatis had to post guards on her door to prevent her brother from \"undoing years of\nplanning\" by entering her chambers and raping her before she was given to Khal \nDrogo\n. He recounts how the meek\nlittle girl he knew was reborn in the Dothraki sea as a true Targaryen, before turning to Slaver's Bay, conquering\nAstapor\n, cowing \nYunkai\n and sacking \nMeereen\n. He now expects her to make her way to Volantis - where she will\nmeet Tyrion and Griff with enough forces to carry her to \nWesteros\n.\nTyrion presses Illyrio, wanting to know why a slaver city like Volantis and a man such as Illyrio would want to\nassist Daenerys, and he says that her brother promised him the position of \nMaster of Coin\n and the castle of his\nchoice. Tyrion also demands to know how he is friends with \nVarys\n, and Illyrio tells him that the two of them were\nthieves together in Pentos - with Varys spying on and stealing from other thieves, then passing them on to Illyrio,\nwho would return the goods to their rightful owners for a fee. Varys trained a network of spies - young boys and\ngirls - to steal information, and eventually the two of them became influential enough that Illyrio was able to marry\nthe daughter of the cousin of the Prince of Pentos, and Varys was sought by \nAerys the Mad\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a6341852ff0ff6ca38e8f27880442c3c63b6982f7dffda0d21e3f24810a74472_v2"}
