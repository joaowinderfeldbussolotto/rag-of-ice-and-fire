At the camp some of the \nBloody Mummers\n come to rape \nBrienne\n. Jaime knows that if she resists they\nwill probably kill her so he advises her to take her mind far away. He recalls that when \nAerys\n cooked Lord \nRickard\nStark\n alive while \nBrandon\n died trying to rescue him, Jaime did the same. Brienne is stubborn and wants to resist.\nJaime saves her again by yelling “sapphires” loud enough for the \nGoat\n to hear. Brienne thanks him as Jaime\nconsiders the debt (revenge) that he owes to Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers: a \nLannister\n always pays his\ndebts.\nAfter reaching Harrenhal, Hoat presents the Kingslayer to \nRoose Bolton\n, who is disgusted that the Mummers hacked\noff his hand. He has \nQyburn\n cleanse the stump and bandage it. Jaime asks Qyburn to see to Brienne's wounds as\nwell.\nNavigation:\nJaime III\n↑\nJon IV\n ←\nJaime IV\n→ \nTyrion IV\n↓\nJaime V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 32: Tyrion IV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion III\n↑\nJaime IV\n ←\nTyrion IV\n→ \nSamwell II\n↓\nTyrion V\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n visits \nSymon Silvertongue\n, and thinks to pay him to leave \nKing's Landing\n. But the singer wishes to join the\ntournament of singers that will take place during \nJoffrey\n’s wedding. He blackmails Tyrion by indicating that he will\ntell about his relation with \nShae\n. Tyrion promises him that one of the other singers will be removed, and \nBronn\n will\nvisit him in three days' time. Outside, Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Symon.\nLater, \nTyrion's father\n shows him the two new \nValyrian\n swords he had made for Joffrey and \nJaime\n. Master \nTobho\nMott\n reworked the metal, and the color of the blade on each sword is black and red. \nHouse Lannister\n has not had a\nValyrian sword in hundreds of years, and try as he might, Tywin could never get any of the lesser houses to sell\ntheirs. Where the steel for these new swords came from is not revealed. Tywin tells him that he must consummate\nhis marriage to \nSansa\n, and that \nMace Tyrell\n rejected the marriage proposal between \nCersei\n and \nWillas\n, probably\nbecause the \nQueen of Thorns\n told him to.\nPycelle\n brings dire tidings from \nthe Wall\n, and that Maester \nAemon\n fears Lord \nMormont\n is dead. Tywin tells Pycelle\nto send a veiled message that no men shall be sent to the Wall unless \nJanos Slynt\n is considered for the post of \nLord\nCommander of the Night's Watch\n. Tyrion thinks to himself that he should have had Slynt and Pycelle put to death\nwhen he had the chance.\nNavigation:\nTyrion III\n↑\nJaime IV\n ←\nTyrion IV\n→ \nSamwell II\n↓\nTyrion V\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 33: Samwell II\nPlace(s): \nCraster's Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell I\n↑\nTyrion IV\n ←\nSamwell II\n→ \nArya VI\n↓\nSamwell III\nSynopsis\nForty-four survivors have reached \nCraster's Keep\n, of the 300 men \nthe Watch\n had at \nthe Fist\n. Some of the men are\nbecoming ornery because there is so little food, and \nCraster\n seems to be hiding a larder. \nMormont\n speaks with \nSam\nabout \ndragonglass\n, noting in disgust that the Watch once knew the purpose of obsidian weapons. Their true enemies\nare the \nOthers\n, but they had forgotten.\nCraster soon makes it clear he wants the crows gone, and several members start to accuse him of not sharing all his\nfood. The argument worsens, until finally Craster attacks \nClubfoot Karl\n, beginning the \nmutiny at Craster's Keep\n.\nDirk\n slits Craster's throat, and when Mormont screams at them that there is no crime worse than murder at a host's\ndinner table, \nOllo Lophand\n stabs the Lord Commander. Sam watches in horror as the deserters begin to rape\nCraster's wives, and sees the few men still loyal to the Watch flee because they are outnumbered. \nGrenn\n, \nGiant\n,\nDolorous Edd\n, and a few others get away. Mormont, dying, commands Sam to return to the Wall with all haste and\ntell everyone what has happened. He also asks Sam to tell his son \nJorah\n that Mormont's dying wish is for Jorah to\ntake the black. His last words to Sam are, \"Tell Jorah. Forgive him. My son. Please. Go.\" Sam is approached by\nGilly\n, who has recently given birth to a son, and two of Craster's other, older, wives. Gilly asks Sam to take her with\nhim, to flee on horseback someplace warm.\nNavigation:\nSamwell I\n↑\nTyrion IV\n ←\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9f16d797cd1ab0d3072188660e01ca78a3168655492544d711958e887037375c_v2"}
