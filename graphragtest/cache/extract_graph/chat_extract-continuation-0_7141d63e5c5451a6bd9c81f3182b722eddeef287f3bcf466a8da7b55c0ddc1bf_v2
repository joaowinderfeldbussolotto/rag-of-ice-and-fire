She takes a much\nneeded bath and dons a \ntokar\n to dine with \nHizdahr zo Loraq\n. \nReznak mo Reznak\n and \nGalazza Galare\n inform her that\nher body must be inspected by the man's house before the wedding. Daenerys first refuses to follow this tradition but\nis then convinced to do so. She is asked to open the fighting pits as a wedding gift but refuses to do that.\nWhile waiting for dinner, Hizdahr informs her that \nYunkai\n will make peace for a fee and the freedom to resume\nslaving, but then \nSer Barristan\n notifies her that the Yunkai'i are on the march and \nDaario Naharis\n has returned.\nDaenerys excuses herself from dinner and meets with Daario.\nDaario informs her that several of Yunkai's sellswords defected to him, but \nBrown Ben Plumm\n and the \nSecond Sons\nin turn went over to Yunkai.

Her plight moves Theon considerably.\nTheon has been chosen to ceremoniously present \"Arya\" in marriage to Ramsay, since he was the longtime ward of\nEddard Stark\n and it is widely believed that Arya's trueborn brothers are dead. \nJon Snow\n is a bastard half-brother and\nwhile Theon believes \nBran\n and \nRickon Stark\n to be alive, he does not dare to reveal that.\nMeanwhile, \nWinterfell\n is suffering from both a hard white frost and the looming menace of the coming of \nStannis\nBaratheon\n's troops. Even so, Ramsay marries Fake Arya in the \ngodswood\n. A bard by the name of Abel arrives\nuninvited, with six women followers, to perform for the wedding. Theon believes that he hears his name (\"Theon\")\nwhispered by the godswood, after months of thinking of himself only as Reek. That and the memories of a different\nlife in a far livelier Winterfell shake him deeply.\nAfter the marriage, there is a banquet with many northern guests, including Lord \nWyman Manderly\n, who is\nparticularly pleased with the meal\n. Lady \nBarbrey Dustin\n engages in a surprisingly frank conversation with Theon\nabout her mistrust of the Boltons and of the \nmaesters\n of the \nCitadel\n.\nRamsay calls for Theon and cruelly humiliates both him and the fake Arya (Jeyne) in his quarters.\nNavigation:\nReek III\n↑\nDaenerys VI\n ←\nThe Prince of Winterfell\n→ \nThe Watcher\n↓\nThe Turncloak\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 38: The Watcher\nPlace(s): \nSunspear\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Captain of Guards\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nThe Prince of Winterfell\n ←\nThe Watcher\n→ \nJon VIII\nSynopsis\nBalon Swann\n has arrived in \nSunspear\n, with the \nskull of Gregor Clegane\n.
