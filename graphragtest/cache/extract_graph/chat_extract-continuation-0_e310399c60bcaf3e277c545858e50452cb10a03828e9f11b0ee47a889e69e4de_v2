Tyrion asks \nScar\n, a soldier slave in Yezzan's ownership, to send 2 men to get fresh clean\nwater for Yezzan. Scar refuses because he will not take orders from a slave, even though he himself is a slave. He\ntells Tyrion to get the water himself with Penny. Tyrion asks for the mule and the cart to get the water. Scar refuses\nbut gives them \nJorah Mormont\n to help get the water. The three of them travel through the camp to the nearest well\nsouth and west of a \ntrebuchet\n, the Harridan. On the way, Tyrion sees defenses being built to defend against the\npossible return of \nDrogon\n, although he knows that most of these will prove useless against \ndragons\n. Tyrion knows\nthat a dragon's eyes are its only weak spot, and not the underbelly or throat as old wives' tales claim. While waiting\nat the well, they hear the latest news and rumors from other slaves, who are discussing the event at \nDaznak's Pit\n. It is\nargued whether \nDaenerys Targaryen\n flew off on the dragon or died trying. Tyrion states she did not die because her\nbody was not found. He briefly thinks on the moment when he almost revealed his identity to her, only to stop out of\nfear \nBarristan Selmy\n would prejudice Daenerys against him out of contempt for \nHouse Lannister\n.\nAfter getting the water, they are supposed to return to their camp, but Tyrion leads them to the tents of the \nSecond\nSons\n instead. He knows that right now, while Yezzan is on the verge of death, is the best time for them to try and\nescape the grasp of the slavers. When they get there, Tyrion is recognized as the dwarf that \nBrown Ben Plumm\nwished to buy so they are brought to the captain. There he reveals that he knows that Ben Plumm knows who Tyrion\nreally is and that Tyrion knows that Plumm is a westerman and of \nHouse Plumm\n and that the dragons were fond of\nhim. He implies that he knows more about Plumm's lineage than even Plumm himself, and that Plumm may have\nmore \nTargaryen\n blood than he thinks. Ben Plumm then recognizes Jorah Mormont, and Tyrion convinces Ben\nPlumm to let him and Mormont join the Second Sons instead of killing him in order to win a lordship from \nCersei\nLannister\n. Tyrion suggests they play a game of \ncyvasse\n as they continue talking.\nNavigation:\nTyrion X\n↑\nThe Iron Suitor\n ←\nTyrion XI\n→ \nJon XII\n↓\nTyrion XII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 58: Jon XII\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon XI\n↑\nTyrion XI\n ←\nJon XII\n→ \nThe Discarded Knight\n↓\nJon XIII\nSynopsis\nTormund Giantsbane\n along with over three thousand \nwildlings\n pass the \nWall\n at \nCastle Black\n. The price of their\nentry, which was negotiated between Jon and Tormund, is that the wildlings will yield all valuables so that they can\nbe sold for food, as well as one hundred boys as hostages. Initially, two girls are included in the one hundred\nhostages, although Jon spots them and they are replaced by two new boys. Tormund voluntarily includes his own\nson as a hostage as a sign of good faith. Jon decides to take him on as his own squire.\nWhile watching the Wildlings pass through the wall, Jon and Tormund speak of many things. Jon mentions that\nMelisandre\n burned the \nhorn of Joramun\n that Mance and the wildlings were supposedly going to use to break down\nthe Wall. Tormund tells Jon that although they did find that huge horn in the \nSkirling Pass\n, it is not actually the true\nHorn of Joramun, or they would have used it when they assaulted the Wall. Jon, confused, tries to decide whether it\nwas Mance that lied to him or Tormund lying to him now about the authenticity of the horn.\nThe rear guard of the Wildings with Tormund includes a warg who is accompanied by his boar. \nGhost\n and this boar\nseem to be on edge around each other, and it is mentioned that they should be restrained while the wildings are\nstaying at Castle Black. Most of the wildlings will be relocated in the coming weeks.\nLater, Jon receives a letter from \nCotter Pyke\n, saying that he is stranded at \nHardhome\n, and calls for help. He also\nreveals that the Braavosi captains on loan from Tychos would only allow wildling women and children aboard their\nships, and that the Woods Witch has taken to calling them slavers. This explains Arya's report that the wildlings\nfrom Hardhome had been captured by slavers, as narrated in \"The Blind Girl\". He also says there are \ndead things\nboth in the woods and the water, lending a great deal of urgency to his message.\nNavigation:\nJon XI\n↑\nTyrion XI\n ←\nJon XII\n→ \nThe Discarded Knight\n↓\nJon
