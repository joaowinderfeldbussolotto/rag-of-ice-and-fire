The council decides to warn the Watch that the crown will stop sending men to the Wall,\nbut Qyburn suggests that they do send 100 men. Cersei picks up on this, with the idea that the men sent will really\nbe assassins ordered to remove \nEddard Stark\n's bastard.\nBack in her apartments, Cersei learns from \nTaena\n that \nDorcas\n fancies \nOsney Kettleblack\n, and also hints that she\nherself likes dangerous, scarred men. Cersei tries to learn the name of Taena's old flame, but the \nMyrish\n woman is\nevasive.\nWhen Osney arrives, Cersei butters him up with an offer to join the \nKingsguard\n and a chance to bed her again,\nprovided he accomplishes a couple of tasks. First, Cersei wants him to seduce, and hopefully bed, Queen \nMargaery\n;\nthis will enable Cersei to execute her lawfully. Second, she plans to send him to the \nWall\n as \"punishment\" for his\ntreason with Margaery, but in reality he will lead a group of men to assassinate \nJon Snow\n. She assures him that the\nmen would not be required to serve in the Watch after they complete their task, and promises him a lordship, should\nhe accomplish both missions.\nLater that night, Cersei asks Lady Taena to remark to Margaery that she has a secret admirer, but not to let out Ser\nOsney's name unless the girl probes.\nNavigation:\nCersei III\n↑\nJaime II\n ←\nCersei IV\n→ \nThe Iron Captain\n↓\nCersei V\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 18: The Iron Captain\nPlace(s): \nNagga's Cradle\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei IV\n ←\nThe Iron Captain\n→ \nThe Drowned Man\n↓\nThe Reaver\nSynopsis\nVictarion\n has left the defense of \nMoat Cailin\n to \nRalf Kenning\n, and sailed the \nIron Fleet\n to \nOld Wyk\n for the\nkingsmoot\n. When the fleet arrives at \nNagga's Cradle\n, Victarion has them blockade \nEuron\n's \nSilence\n. The first to greet\nhim on shore is \nAeron\n, and later that night the priest is at his side for the feast. Several captains pledge their voice to\nVictarion's claim, but \nLord Blacktyde\n seeks a king who will end the wars, saying,\n\"\nBalon\n was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all.\"\nSoon, the captain finds \nhis niece\n, advising her not to lay forth a claim, because a woman has no place ruling the\nironborn. Asha stands by her claim, and notes that the Damphair may have underestimated the appeal of the\nKingsmoot, since \nthe Drumm\n will present his claim and there is talk of \nMaron Volmark\n being presented as heir of\nthe throne by \nTarle the Thrice-Drowned\n, while it is apparent that Aeron's intent was to legitimize Victarion as\nBalon's successor.\nTheir chat is interrupted by the arrival of Euron. Victarion notes Euron does not seem to have aged in the almost\nthree years that he has been gone. Aeron confronts Euron with the accusation that \n\"no godless man may sit the\nSeastone Chair\n\"\n, but Euron cows his brother into leaving the hall. Asha then accuses her uncle of the death of her\nfather, but Euron denies he had anything to do with it. When a fight nearly breaks out between Asha and one of\nEuron's men, Victarion steps in and demands that Euron leave. After his departure, Victarion and his niece walk\noutside, and Asha asks why Euron was banished by her father, for he refused to ever speak of it. Victarion\neventually tells her that Euron impregnated \nVictarion's wife\n. Victarion wanted to kill his brother but Balon forbid it\nand sent Euron to exile. Later Victarion killed his wife with his own hands.\nAsha offers to set aside her claim if Victarion will name her his Hand and end the war. She feels that the Ironborn\nhave overextended themselves and tells her uncle that she has reached an agreement with Lady \nSybelle Glover\n, and\nthat their people may keep \nSea Dragon Point\n and the \nStony Shore\n in return for the release of \nDeepwood Motte\n,\nTorrhen's Square\n and \nMoat Cailin\n.
