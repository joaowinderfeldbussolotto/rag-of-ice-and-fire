To the consternation of the court it is \nOberyn Martell\n, another judge. \nTywin\n is angry but grants\nTyrion's request and sets the date for the battle on the next morrow.\nThe next morning Tyrion is given leave to visit his champion. Oberyn plans to fight with a spear and use only light\narmor. He specifically warns Tyrion not to touch the weapon. He is full of confidence but Tyrion is not sure of his\nchoice of weapon. Oberyn invites Tyrion to go to \nDorne\n after the trial and talks about crowning \nMyrcella\n. Then he\nchanges the subject to the time he visited \nLannisport\n with his mother and \nsister\n.\nHis mother and \nTyrion's mother\n were friends and were planning on marrying \nJaime\n to Elia and/or Cersei to Oberyn.\nWhen they arrived at \nCasterly Rock\n, Joanna had died and Tywin refused both suggestions and said that Cersei was\nintended for Prince \nRhaegar Targaryen\n. Later Elia married prince Rhaegar. Oberyn thinks that this is why Tywin\nhad Elia killed. \nOberyn proclaims that today he will have justice for Elia and her children.\nThe combat is held in the outer ward. As soon as the fight begins, Oberyn starts to accuse Gregor of Elia's rape and\nmurder. By using a spear as his weapon Oberyn has the advantage of being able to reach his enemy, and because he\nis only lightly armored he is fast enough to remain out of Gregor's reach. Oberyn manages to wound his enemy\nseverely, disarming him and knocking him onto the ground. Before Oberyn can finish his opponent, Gregor grabs\nOberyn by the leg and drags him down. With his bare hands Gregor smashes Oberyn's teeth, crushes his head, and\nkills him, all while admiting to the murder and rape of Elia and the murder of her children. Tyrion realizes that he is\ncondemned when the \nGold Cloaks\n take him to the \nblack cells\n.\nNavigation:\nTyrion IX\n↑\nJon IX\n ←\nTyrion X\n→ \nDaenerys VI\n↓\nTyrion XI\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 71: Daenerys VI\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys V\n↑\nTyrion X\n ←\nDaenerys VI\n→ \nJaime IX\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nDaenerys I\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n sits in the great pyramid of \nMeereen\n, her troops having conquered the city after the men she sent into the\nsewers opened the gates. She meets an envoy from \nAstapor\n, who represents King \nCleon\n the great, a former butcher\nwho now rules Astapor, supposedly in Dany’s name. But the envoy suggests that King Cleon wishes to marry Dany,\nand that the men she left to rule Astapor have all been deposed. Cleon has amassed new slaves, and is beginning to\ntrain them as \nUnsullied\n, and Daenerys is dismayed that all she has done to free Astapor of slavery is coming undone.\nFinally, she sends for Ser \nJorah\n and Ser \nBarristan\n, wishing the two had died in the sewers, but the two knights are\ngreater warriors than even that suicide quest. Barristan speaks of things Daenerys was never aware of, that \nher father\nwas mad, and that \nViserys\n, even as a young boy, seemed to be \nmore like his father\n than his brother \nRhaegar\n. The old\nknight tells her,\nThe Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. King \nJaehaerys\n once told me that madness and\ngreatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a \nTargaryen\n is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the\nworld holds its breath to see how it will land.\nShe absolves Barristan, and he swears his sword to her cause. But Ser Jorah does not beg forgiveness, and remains\ndefensive, insisting that he has done nothing wrong. Daenerys then exiles the knight who was once her closest friend\nand protector, threatening to kill him if she ever sees him again.\nLater, \nDaario\n warns her that she should not have banished Jorah, and that she may come to regret not keeping him\nnear or having him killed outright. When her advisors urge her to move on, Daenerys decides that she must learn to\nrule if she ever wishes to sit the throne of \nWesteros\n, and she declares that she will stay in Meereen and rule as queen.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys V\n↑\nTyrion X\n ←\nDaenerys VI\n→ \nJaime IX\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nDaenerys I\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 72: Jaime IX\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime VIII\n↑\nDaenerys VI\n ←\nJaime IX\n→ \nJon X\n↓\nA Feast for Crows\nJaime I\nSynopsis\nJaime\n is seated with the \nsmall council\n, as King \nTommen\n signs all the papers brought\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2017974a68a16102b0b8ce863251f3aa242cc99c6349c58c4b7bce5af6c2f6c7_v2"}
