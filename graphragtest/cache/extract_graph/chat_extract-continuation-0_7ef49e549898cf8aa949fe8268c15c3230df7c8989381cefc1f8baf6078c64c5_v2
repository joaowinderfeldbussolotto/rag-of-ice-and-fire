After the death of the previous First Sword, many \nbravos\n were called to the \nSealord\n and as many were sent\naway. Finally, Syrio was called before the Sealord, who had a fat yellow cat on his lap. The Sealord said the animal\nhad been brought to him from a faraway land by one of his captains and asked if Syrio had ever seen her like. Syrio\nreplied that he had seen a thousand like him in the alleys of Braavos, and that same day Syrio was named the First\nSword. Arya says she does not understand. Syrio explains that the cat was just an ordinary one, but the other men all\nexpected a marvelous beast, so that was what they saw. In addition, the Sealord had called it “her” and that was what\nthe others saw, even though it was clearly a tomcat. Arya understands then, and Syrio tells her to uses her senses\nfirst and her mind second. Then he declares that when they get to Winterfell it will be time to put “\nNeedle\n” in her\nhand.\nThe great wooden doors fly open to reveal five \nLannister guardsmen\n and Ser \nMeryn Trant\n of the \nKingsguard\n. Meryn\norders Arya to come with him to see her father. Arya is about to follow when Syrio stops her and asks why Lord\nEddard\n would send Lannister men instead of his own. Arya immediately realizes the truth of Syrio’s statement and\npicks up her stick sword. When Meryn insists he is trustworthy as a member of the Kingsguard, Arya replies that so\nis \nthe Kingslayer\n.\nDispensing with the charade, Meryn orders Arya seized. When a guard approaches Arya, Syrio stands before her.\nThe guard orders Syrio out of the way, calling him an old man. Syrio declares his name and that they will be\nspeaking to him with more respect. Unimpressed, the guard goes for his sword but Syrio is faster and breaks the\nman’s fingers with his wooden sword. Then Meryn orders the Lannister guards to attack and Syrio instructs Arya to\ngo to her father. As the guards attack Syrio, Arya can see that Syrio was only toying with her during their practices;\nby the time Arya reaches the far end of the hall, Syrio is surrounded by five dead or dying men. Then Meryn, in his\nheavy plate armor, draws his sword. Syrio tells Arya to go, but she watches as the First Sword lands many blows on\nthe knight's armor before Meryn breaks Syrio’s wooden sword. Arya turns and runs through the kitchen, crying.\nAs she runs, Arya thinks of everything Syrio has told her: “Swift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. Quick as a snake.\nCalm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than\nswords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords…”\n\nHer sword grip is slick with sweat when she reaches the turret stair. She wonders if she should go up or down. She\nthen remembers Syrio telling her to do the unexpected, so she goes down to a cavernous cellar that she knows is a\ndead end. She climbs up to a window. Outside the window she can see the stout door to the \nTower of the Hand\n is\nsplintered, one of her father’s guards lies dead on the stairs, and she can hear fighting. She thinks about when she\nheard a man say that if one \nHand\n can die, so can another. As she moves, Arya pretends that she is catching cats but\nthen realizes that she is the cat and is dead if they catch her.\nOutside the stable she finds \nHullen\n lying on the ground, looking dead. When she approaches him, he opens his eyes\nand tells her to warn her father before dying. Inside, Arya finds more dead men including \nDesmond\n, who said he\nwould protect her father. There is only a single Lannister body, and Arya remembers Desmond's claim that every\nnorthman\n was worth ten \nsouthrons\n. Losing her temper, Arya kicks Desmond's body and calls him a liar.\nAs Arya collects horse tack, she finds her broken chest on the ground. She gropes around for \nNeedle\n. Just as her\nfingers touch the sword a stable boy appears behind her with a pitchfork. She asks him to help her saddle a horse,\nsaying her father will reward him. The boy responds that her father is dead and that \nthe queen\n will reward him.\nWhen he grabs her arm, Arya forgets all of Syrio’s lessons, only remembering the lesson that \nJon Snow\n taught her.\nShe sticks the pointy end through the boy’s belly, killing him.\nAs she saddles her mare, Arya realizes that the gates will be closed and the guards will let no one out; she has to go\nanother way. Immediately she wonders if she can find the room with the monsters again. However, to do that she\nmust cross the open yard and the walls are crowded with more \ngold cloaks\n and soldiers than she has ever seen.\nReciting Syrio’s words to herself, she walks slowly across the yard to the empty royal sept,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FIRST SWORD OF BRAAVOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Title held by the greatest warrior in Braavos, responsible for protecting the Sealord)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRIO<|>PERSON<|>A skilled warrior and the First Sword of Braavos who trains Arya in sword fighting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl being trained by Syrio in sword fighting and survival skills)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAAVOS<|>GEO<|>A city where Syrio is from and where the Sealord resides)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEALORD<|>PERSON<|>The ruler of Braavos who appoints the First Sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANNISTER GUARDSMEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Soldiers serving House Lannister who attempt to capture Arya)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERYN TRANT<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Kingsguard who orders Arya to be seized)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGSGUARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An elite group of knights sworn to protect the royal family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORD EDDARD<|>PERSON<|>Arya's father, also known as Ned Stark, who is a prominent nobleman)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGSSLAYER<|>PERSON<|>A reference to Jaime Lannister, a member of the Kingsguard known for betraying a king)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The ancestral home of House Stark, where Arya is supposed to go)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEEDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arya's personal sword, given to her by Jon Snow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOWER OF THE HAND<|>GEO<|>A location in the Red Keep where Arya's father is attacked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A title referring to the king's chief advisor, held by Lord Eddard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HULLEN<|>PERSON<|>A guard of Lord Eddard who warns Arya before dying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESMOND<|>PERSON<|>A guard of Lord Eddard who is killed by Lannister forces)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHMAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>People from the North of Westeros, known for their strength and loyalty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHRONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>People from the southern regions of Westeros, often contrasted with Northmen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE QUEEN<|>PERSON<|>Cersei Lannister, the queen who is an antagonist in the story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON SNOW<|>PERSON<|>Arya's half-brother who taught her a crucial lesson about fighting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD CLOAKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City watch of King's Landing, serving the Lannisters)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYRIO<|>FIRST SWORD OF BRAAVOS<|>Syrio holds the title of First Sword of Braavos<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYRIO<|>ARYA<|>Syrio is training Arya in sword fighting and survival skills<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYRIO<|>SEALORD<|>Syrio was appointed First Sword by the Sealord<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>LORD EDDARD<|>Arya is the daughter of Lord Eddard<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>NEEDLE<|>Needle is Arya's personal sword<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Winterfell is Arya's home<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MERYN TRANT<|>KINGSGUARD<|>Meryn Trant is a member of the Kingsguard<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MERYN TRANT<|>LANNISTER GUARDSMEN<|>Meryn Trant commands the Lannister guardsmen<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD EDDARD<|>TOWER OF THE HAND<|>Lord Eddard's office is in the Tower of the Hand<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HULLEN<|>LORD EDDARD<|>Hullen is a guard serving Lord Eddard<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DESMOND<|>LORD EDDARD<|>Desmond is a guard serving Lord Eddard<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>JON SNOW<|>Jon Snow is Arya's half-brother who taught her a fighting lesson<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>THE QUEEN<|>The Queen is an antagonist to Arya<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOLD CLOAKS<|>LANNISTER GUARDSMEN<|>Gold Cloaks and Lannister guardsmen serve the same faction<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
