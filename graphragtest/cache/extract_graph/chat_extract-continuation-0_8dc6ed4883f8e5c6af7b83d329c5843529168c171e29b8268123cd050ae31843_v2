He is\nconfused to see such a large force of men to the west, seemingly fighting Stannis’s men, and can’t figure out where\nthey came from. But he has little time to consider it, as he sees hundreds of Stannis’s troops crossing the \nBlackwater\nby using the half-sunk ships as a bridge. Racing onto the boats, Tyrion’s men are overwhelmed, and he goes over the\nedge of a gunwale, clinging for his life. Ser Mandon Moore appears and tells Tyrion to take his hand, his left hand.\nAs Tyrion reaches for his hand, he instinctively withdraws as Ser Mandon’s sword slices into his face. Tyrion,\ngrievously wounded, watches as \nPodrick Payne\n saves his life by shoving Ser Mandon into the river.\nNavigation:\nTyrion XIII\n↑\nSansa VI\n ←\nTyrion XIV\n→ \nSansa VII\n↓\nTyrion XV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 62: Sansa VII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VI\n↑\nTyrion XIV\n ←\nSansa VII\n→ \nDaenerys V\n↓\nSansa VIII\nSynopsis\nSer \nLancel\n curses \nCersei\n for calling \nher son\n back inside \nthe Holdfast\n, when the king’s presence might have rallied\nthe troops. He claims all is lost, and Cersei leaves the room. \nSansa\n watches as Lancel falls to his knees, severely\ninjured. She attempts to calm Cersei's guests and orders others to help Lancel receive medical care.\nDontos\n persuades her to lock herself in her room, and when Sansa arrives at her chambers, she finds \nSandor Clegane\nhiding in the shadows. The Hound, drunk and battered from the fighting, tells her he lost, and that he should have\nkilled \nTyrion\n years ago. Sandor claims he is leaving \nKing's Landing\n, maybe to head north somewhere. Clegane\nforces her to look at him, and then tells her, \"I could keep you safe…No one would hurt you again, or I’d kill them.\"\nSandor then asks that she sing for him, as she had promised she would. She is too frightened to remember the words\nof the song he wants, and can only sing the \nMother's Hymn\n. After that, some instinct makes her cup his cheek with\nher fingers, and she can feel tears on his cheeks. Sandor strips off his white cloak and leaves her room.\nLater, Dontos returns to bring her the news--the battle is over, King’s Landing has been saved by the \nTyrells\n and\nLord \nTywin\n and all their men. Lord Tywin held the right wing, Lord \nRandyll Tarly\n the center, and \nMace Tyrell\ncommanded the left.

However, \nXaro\n, whose guest she is, warns her that\nthe \nWarlocks\n are gathering their power to come for her, and that the other two great merchant consortiums want her\neither expelled from \nthe city\n, or killed outright. Dany realizes she must flee, for Xaro’s protection can only go so far.\nThe merchant again asks her to marry him, but this time Dany learns that what Xaro really wants is one of the\ndragons. Dany tells him that it would cost one-third of all the ships in the world in order for her to give up one of her\ndragons. Xaro leaves, and Dany questions Ser \nJorah\n about some of the mysteries she saw in the \nHouse of the\nUndying\n. Jorah says that the three heads of the dragon represent \nAegon\n and his two sisters, but Dany is not\nconvinced.
