Catelyn says she had expected it to be Lord \nStannis\n and Galbart Glover says they all did.\nThe meeting is held in the great hall at four long tables. Lord Hoster is too weak to attend, but the attendance\nincludes Edmure and the Blackfish with the Tully bannermen arrayed around them: Lord \nJonos Bracken\n, Lord \nTytos\nBlackwood\n, Lord \nJason Mallister\n, Ser \nMarq Piper\n, Ser \nStevron Frey\n, \nKaryl Vance\n (a lord now, following his father’s\ndeath), and Lord \nLyman Darry\n, son of Ser \nRaymun Darry\n. The smaller number of northern lords sits opposite: Robb,\nTheon, Rickard Karstark (grief-stricken over the death of his two sons), Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and\nGreatjon Umber.\nThe lords argue late into the night with every lord taking full advantage of his right to speak. \nRoose Bolton\n has\nreformed their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Lord \nTywin Lannister\n has crossed the \nTrident\n and is making\nfor \nHarrenhal\n. Some lords favor marching east to meet Lord Tywin at Harrenhal. Marq Piper favors marching west\nto \nCasterly Rock\n. Jason Mallister suggests they simply stay athwart Lord Tywin’s supply lines and rest their troops.\nJonos Bracken proposes they pledge fealty to Renly and move south to join him.\nRobb, speaking for the first time, insists that Renly is not the king. The lords protest that Robb cannot mean to hold\nto \nJoffrey\n, who executed his father. Robb insists that that makes Joffrey evil, but does not make Renly king; as the\nyoungest brother, Renly cannot be king before Stannis. That splits the room again, with some favoring Stannis and\nsome still favoring Renly who is crowned and has \nHighgarden\n and \nStorm's End\n to support him. Robb states he does\nnot know what to do since Joffrey is the true heir, but he executed \nhis father\n based on a lie. Ser \nStevron Frey\n, old\nWalder Frey\n’s heir, suggests that they make peace and allow Renly and Joffrey to fight and oppose or submit to the\nwinner as they choose; Lord Tywin would welcome the truce and the return of his son. This is met with shouts of\noutrage.\nCatelyn suggests a peace. Robb reminds her that the Lannisters murdered her husband and that he will have no\npeace with them, laying his sword on the table to emphasize his point. Catelyn points out that the war was started to\nfree Eddard and to protect the Riverlands. The Riverlands are now safe and no amount of vengeance will bring her\nhusband back. She wants her daughters safe, for Robb to be safe and ruling from \nWinterfell\n, and to go home. Ser\nBrynden questions what the terms of peace could be that would prevent another war in the near future. Rickard\n\nKarstark and Jonos Bracken question what their sacrifices have been worth if peace is made now. Tytos Blackwood\nnotes that if they make peace with King Joffrey, are they not traitors to King Renly? Catelyn’s hopes of peace\nshatter before her eyes.\nThe meeting breaks down into another argument of which king to support, until \nthe Greatjon\n rises to his feet and\nsilences them all. He spits upon all the kings and declares that Renly and Stannis are nothing to him. He asks why\nthey should rule over him and his from some flowery seat in the south when they know nothing about \nthe North\n.\nEven their \ngods\n are wrong. The Greatjon asks why they should not rule themselves again. It was the \ndragons\n they\nsubmitted to and the dragons are all dead. Then the immense man points his two-handed greatsword at Robb and\nproclaims:\nThere\n sits the only king I mean to bend \nmy\n knee to, m’lords. The \nKing in the North\n!\nThe other bannermen all take up the call, even the river lords who have never been ruled from Winterfell. And for\nthe first time in 300 years, there is a King in the North.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn X\n↑\nJon IX\n ←\nCatelyn XI\n→ \nDaenerys X\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nCatelyn I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 72: Daenerys X\nPlace(s): \nDothraki Sea\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys IX\n↑\nCatelyn XI\n ←\nDaenerys X\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nDaenerys I\nDaenerys\n builds a funeral pyre for \nDrogo\n and places her dragon eggs among his treasures.
