Immediately\ntaken by her, Theon responds to her flirtations, eventually offering her a ride to \nhis father's\n \ncastle\n. They continue to\nflirt on route to \nPyke\n, but upon their arrival, Theon discovers that Esgred is actually his older sister, \nAsha\n. At the\nfeast held by Lord \nBalon Greyjoy\n that evening, Asha sits in the seat to Balon's right, a place of high honor. Theon\nand Asha later join their father and two uncles, \nVictarion\n and \nAeron\n, in Balon's solar, where Balon reveals his plans.\nTheon is furious to discover that he has been given the least important mission.\nSynopsis\nTheon Greyjoy is at the docks at \nLordsport\n, admiring his \nnew longship\n. He is approached by a striking ironborn\nwoman calling herself Esgred. Theon is taken by her and immediately begins to flirt. Although she responds to\nTheon's flirtations, Esgred informs him that she is married and pregnant. Theon is not bothered by this, telling her\nthat he cannot father a \nbastard\n on her if she is pregnant and attempting to sway her by informing her he is a prince.\nWhen he asks whether he should name his ship after her, Esgred tells him that he should, as she has she build his\nship. She informs him she is the daughter of \nAmbrode\n and the wife of \nSigrin\n, the shipwright. When Theon claims\nshe is wasted on Sigrin, she in turn claims that, according to Sigrin, the ship is wasted on Theon. She asks what\nTheon thinks of his new ship, but when Theon calls the ship a \"fair maiden\", Esgred states she is a sea bitch. Theon\ndeclares \nSea Bitch\n to be the name of his new ship, which will be blessed by his uncle \nAeron\n, a priest of the \nDrowned\nGod\n, the next day.\nThey flirt some more, but Esgred continues to refuse to sleep with him. She does accept Theon's invitation to a feast\nheld by Lord \nBalon Greyjoy\n at Pyke that evening. Together, they walk through \nLordsport\n, crowded with the men of\nthe newly arrived Lord \nGorold Goodbrother\n of \nGreat Wyk\n, to the \ninn\n to find Theon's horse and squire. Theon is glad\nto notice that the people grow quiet as they pass and acknowledge them with bows, considering it a sign of respect\nto him. On their way to the inn, Esgred inquires whether Theon has already assembled a crew. When Esgred calls\nout to several men she is familiar with, Theon comes to realize that he has been away from Pyke for a long time and\nthat any friends he once had are now strangers to him. He tells Esgred that his uncle \nVictarion\n has loaned him his\nsteersman, \nRymolf Stormdrunk\n. As they pass the \nMyraham\n, which has not yet been allowed to leave by Lord Balon,\nthe \ncaptain's daughter\n on board calls out to Theon, who admits to Esgred that he has slept with her.\nAt the inn Theon finds his squire, \nWex Pyke\n, whom he orders to saddle his warhorse \nSmiler\n, which he had\npurchased from Lord \nSawane Botley\n. Esgred is impressed by Theon's horse and rides double with Theon to Pyke,\nsitting in front of him. During the ride, he frequently attempts to fondle her breasts, but she removes his hands each\ntime. When she asks Lord Balon will welcome her, Theon tells her that he himself had hardly been welcomed.\nEsgred questions Theon’s status as heir as he has brothers, uncles, and his sister. He tells her that his brothers are\ndead and that he’ll find a husband for his sister \nAsha\n. His uncles, however, are a sore point. Although his own claim\nis stronger, it is not unheard of on the \nIron Islands\n for an uncle to dispose of a weak nephew. Theon claims Aeron\nonly cares for the Drowned God, Victarion is tireless and dutiful, and Euron is most likely dead, having been gone\nfrom the islands for two years. Esgred admits that Euron may be dead and that if he is alive he would be half a\nstranger, which would make it unlikely that the ironborn would seat him on the \nSeastone Chair\n. Theon is bothered\nby the thought, as his absence of ten years has made him more of a stranger than Euron. Regardless, he is\ndetermined to prove himself worthy.\n\nDuring the remainder of the journey they speak of the feast, \nTheon\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2ed40c5a9f86df6419416aafc3f251b5f6ac69ebc052c2dd832cc4a382abcb22_v2"}
