Afterward, he discusses the same topics with \nVarys\n.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n offers more wine to his dinner guest, Lord \nJanos Slynt\n. The butcher’s son accepts and asks if the wine is\nfrom the \nArbor\n. Tyrion replies that the wine is actually an uncommonly rich \nDornish\n vintage. Slynt compliments\nTyrion’s gift for words, calling him a lord, but Tyrion points out that Slynt is the true lord and a simple “Tyrion”\nwill suffice. He notes that Slynt does not sip his wine and is so drunk he dribbles onto his fine clothes. Unlike Slynt,\nTyrion has gone easy on the wine but certainly not the food, since one of his first acts as \nHand\n was to hire the finest\ncook in the city. Slynt is very impressed with the food and says perhaps he will hire Tyrion’s cook to serve him at\nHarrenhal\n. Tyrion quips that wars have been fought over less.\nTyrion declares Slynt a bold man to take a grim and allegedly cursed place like Harrenhal as his seat. Slynt\ndismisses the superstition and insists it takes a bold man to rise as he and Tyrion have. Tyrion refills Slynt’s cup as\nhe asks about Slynt’s list of proposed successors as Commander of the \nCity Watch\n. Slynt opines that he would\nchoose \nAllar Deem\n, whom he describes as a good and loyal man. Tyrion says he is considering Ser \nJacelyn Bywater\n,\na distinguished knight whose name does not appear on Slynt’s list. Slynt argues that Bywater is rigid and thinks\novermuch of himself and his honor, insisting that Allar Deem is the one Tyrion wants. Tyrion remarks that Allar\nDeem is little loved in the streets, but Slynt insists he is feared, which is better. Tyrion brings up that Deem killed a\nyoung whore and her \ninfant daughter\n. Slynt explains that only the child was supposed to die, but the mother got in\nthe way. He says he chose Deem because Deem is a hard man who always follows orders and never speaks of it\nafterward. Tyrion asks who ordered Slynt to kill the whore’s bastard, but Slynt insists he prides himself on being as\ntight-lipped as Allar Deem.\nTyrion suggests that \nJeor Mormont\n, \nLord Commander of the Night’s Watch\n, could use men like Slynt and Deem,\nbut Slynt responds that there is small chance of that. Tyrion points out that life takes queer turns, as it did with\nEddard Stark\n, who never imagined he would die on the steps of \nBaelor’s Sept\n. Slynt laughs that few did and\nconfirms that even \nVarys\n was surprised. Slynt also confirms the execution was King \nJoffrey\n’s decision, and seems\nconfused when Tyrion points out \nCersei\n planned to allow Stark to take the black.\nTyrion comments on Slynt’s new bloody spear sigil, and asks if Slynt drove the spear into Eddard Stark’s back\nhimself or if he only gave the command. Angered, Slynt insists Stark was a traitor who tried to buy him. Tyrion\nreplies, “Little dreaming that you had already been sold.” Slynt declares he will not have his honor questioned, but\nTyrion retorts that Slynt has no honor, though he does admit a spear thrust in the back is a good bargain for a\nlordship and a castle. Slynt rises and demands what right Tyrion has to chastise him. Tyrion points out that Slynt\nknows exactly who he is and should thank the gods he does not have to deal with Lord \nTywin\n instead.\nTyrion declares Slynt’s two \nyounger\n \nsons\n will become squires and the \neldest\n will inherit his title and sufficient\nlands, but not Harrenhal. Then Tyrion explains that the carrack \nSummer's Dream\n will take Slynt to \nthe Wall\n, where\nhe is to join the \nNight's Watch\n and give Tyrion’s regards to Lord Commander Mormont. Enraged, Slynt declares he\n\nhas powerful friends like King Joffrey, \nLittlefinger\n, and Queen Cersei; perhaps Tyrion will be the one banished to\nthe Wall\n.\nAs Slynt throws open the door to leave, he comes face to face with Ser Jacelyn Bywater, whom Tyrion introduces as\nthe new commander of the City Watch. As six gold cloaks usher Slynt away, Tyrion hands Slynt’s list of successors\nto Bywater and asks him to see they accompany Slynt to \nEastwatch-by-the-Sea\n, adding that it would not be taken\namiss if Allar Deem was swept overboard.\nSoon after, Varys glides into the hall to praise Tyrion’s actions. Tyrion comments that he is tempted to do Varys the\nsame as Deem. Varys replies that Tyrion might be disappointed: the storms come and go, but he keeps on paddling.\nTyrion accuses the eunuch of concealing that Cersei sent gold cloaks to kill King \nRobert\n’s bastards. Varys asks\nforgiveness, but Tyrion refuses, angry that he must make a show of punishing the likes of Slynt and Deem while his\nsister continues on her savage course.\nTyrion insists Varys tell him\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3b9438f5b7fbbbda01bb9c3574202ff56597be28d52f07d04f7a9525f8c3b405_v2"}
