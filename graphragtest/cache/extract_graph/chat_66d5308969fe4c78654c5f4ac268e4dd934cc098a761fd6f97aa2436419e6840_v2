He served the now-dead \nRamsay\nSnow\n (the Bastard of Bolton). The bastard and Reek murdered Lady \nHornwood\n. Rodrik’s men shot Snow as he\nattempted to ride away. He had forced Lady Hornwood to marry him and then to sign a will naming him heir. Ser\nRodrik is concerned that \nRoose Bolton\n may not agree that doing this under duress would make the marriage and the\nwill invalid. Rodrik wants to keep Reek alive for judgement when Robb returns. Meanwhile, \nHouse Manderly\n and\nHouse Bolton\n are fighting in the \nHornwood\n forest, and Rodrik does not have the strength to stop them.\nSer Rodrik then brings up Bran commanding Alebelly not to bathe. Bran tells him about the green dream. Maester\nLuwin tells Rodrik that he has explained to Bran the uncertainty of prophesies, but then notes that raiders in\nlongships have been plundering and raping along the \nStony Shore\n, and \nLeobald Tallhart\n sent his nephew \nBenfred\nTallhart\n to deal with it. After he gets more information about the green dream, Rodrik promises not to take Alebelly\nwith him if he rides against the raiders. Bran takes some hope in this.\nWhen Bran meets with the \nReeds\n later that night, Meera agrees that it should be possible to change prophesies.\nMeera gets angry with her brother when he disagrees, claiming that what he sees always comes true. Then Meera\nstates that Alebelly and Bran should both fight to avoid their fates. Bran asks if he drowns also and Jojen reveals\nanother dream of his, in which Bran and Rickon lay dead at Reek's feet, and he was skinning off their faces with a\nlong red blade. Meera states that she could go down to the dungeons and kill Reek now, but Jojen tells her she will\nnot succeed; first the jailers would stop her, and they will never believe. Even if Bran went to \nGreywater Watch\n, he\ncould not avoid his fate; the green dreams do not lie.\nNavigation:\nBran IV\n↑\nJon IV\n ←\nBran V\n→ \nTyrion VIII\n↓\nBran VI\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 36: Tyrion VIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VII\n↑\nBran V\n ←\nTyrion VIII\n→ \nTheon III\n↓\nTyrion IX\nThe \nsmall council\n is discussing the news of \nRenly\n's mysterious murder. \nTyrion\n points out that they have an\nopportunity to recruit \nHouse Tyrell\n to \nJoffrey I\n since they loved Renly but not \nStannis Baratheon\n. To recruit them,\nTyrion recommends that Joffrey marry \nMargaery Tyrell\n. \nCersei\n does not like the idea, stating Joffrey will not like it,\nbut eventually agrees. Neither Cersei nor Tyrion want to leave King’s Landing to meet with the Tyrells but\nLittlefinger\n volunteers, expecting a reward for his service.\nSynopsis\nVarys\n reports the \nmysterious murder\n of \nRenly\n, whose throat was cut like soft cheese. The reports of the murderer\nvary: Stannis with a \nmagic sword\n, a knight of his \nRainbow Guard\n, a maid, a woman spurned, or Lady \nCatelyn Stark\n.\nThe \nsmall council\n, including \nCersei\n, \nTyrion\n, and \nLittlefinger\n, are not pleased with the report since they expect the\ntruth, not rumors. Varys assures them it is not a ruse, and that Renly is dead.\nTyrion notes that \nJoffrey\n will not be happy since he was reserving a spike for Renly’s head. Tyrion himself is also\nunhappy since he was depending on the brothers to decimate each other's armies in battle, but points out the killer's\nidentity is irrelevant; Stannis has to be behind Renly's death, as he stood to gain the most from it.\nVarys reports the foot remain at \nBitterbridge\n and most of the lords have gone over to \nStannis Baratheon\n with, as\nLittlefinger assumed, Lord \nAlester Florent\n being first. \nLoras Tyrell\n, \nRandyll Tarly\n, and \nMathis Rowan\n did not\nswitch allegiance, and Ser \nCortnay Penrose\n will not yield \nStorm's End\n until he sees Renly’s body, which has\ndisappeared. A fifth of the knights left with Loras, who had killed three of Renly’s guards in anger, including\nEmmon Cuy\n and \nRobar Royce\n. Loras is probably headed to Bitterbridge for his sister \nMargaery Tyrell\n and the foot\nstill there. Tyrion notes that this is an opportunity to win the Tyrells to their cause; they may have loved Renly, but\nperhaps they can be convinced to prefer Joffrey over Stannis. Littlefinger suggests bribes, but both Varys and Tyrion\ndo not think gold will win \nHighgarden\n. Littlefinger admits they are right, and states that Loras, although a younger\nson, is \nMace Tyrell\n’s favorite, so they just have to win\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_66d5308969fe4c78654c5f4ac268e4dd934cc098a761fd6f97aa2436419e6840_v2"}
