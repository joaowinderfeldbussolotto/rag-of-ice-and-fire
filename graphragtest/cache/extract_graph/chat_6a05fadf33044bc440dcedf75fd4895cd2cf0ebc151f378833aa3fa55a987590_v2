However, none of them bear word related to \nTyrion\n, and Cersei\nsends them away in frustation. Later, in court, Cersei must deal with several unimportant pleas, and then Septon\nRaynard\n arrives. Furious that the \nHigh Septon\n himself did not come before her, she scoffs at his words that the \nFaith\nis trying to abolish the brothels in the city.\nPycelle\n brings word that Lord \nGyles\n may not live much longer, but Cersei demands that the Grand Maester do his\nutmost to keep the old man alive. At dinner with her son, \nTommen\n mentions that Margaery has been urging him to\nattend court, to which Cersei responds how much she'd like to see the young queen's tongue torn out. Tommen yells\nat his mother, but she commands Ser \nBoros\n to chastise the boy king's \nwhipping boy\n. During the night, Cersei dreams\nof her visit to the witch back when she was 10 years old. She vividly recalls \nMaggy the Frog\n's plea that they leave\nher, but Cersei and \nMelara\n will not back down. Maggy commands them to cut open their thumbs, and the old\neasterner tastes their blood. She prophesized that Cersei would marry the \nking\n (not the \nPrince\n, as Cersei thought),\nbut her husband would father 16 children and Cersei only three, and that she would reign as queen only \"until there\ncomes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear... Gold shall be their\ncrowns and gold their shrouds. And when your tears have drowned you, the \nvalonqar\n shall wrap his hands about\nyour pale white throat and choke the life from you.\" Maggy also warns that Melara will die very soon, and true\nenough, she drowns in a well shortly after.\nWaking from the nightmare, she sends for Pycelle to make her a potion that permits sleep without dreams. She asks\nhim if seeing the future is possible, but the old maester evades answering by saying, \"Should our morrows be\nforetold? And to that I should answer, 'No.' Some doors are best left closed.\" Aggravated, she sends for \nQyburn\n, first\nasking if \nFalyse\n was still capable of being used to root out \nBronn\n. But the necromancer tells her it is too late for that.\nThen she inquires of him the same she had asked of Pycelle. We learn that Maggy was from the far east, and had\nmarried a wealthy merchant. Their son was \"upjumped\" to a petty lord by Cersei's grandfather. Qyburn tells her that\nthe name Maggy was probably a mispronunciation of \"maegi\", and that bloodmagic was very powerful. The de-\nchained maester suggests that she already knew how to forestall the prophecy. Seizing upon this suggestion, Cersei\nplans a fool-proof way to have Margaery killed. Deciding that treason would work best, the next day she inquires of\nSer \nOsmund\n if his brother \nOsney\n could defeat Ser Boros in single combat. He replies that it wouldn't even be a\nmatch, and wonders if Boros has commited treason. Cersei replies no, but thinks to herself: But Osney has.\nNavigation:\nCersei VII\n↑\n\nSamwell IV\n ←\nCersei VIII\n→ \nBrienne VII\n↓\nCersei IX\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 37: Brienne VII\nPlace(s): \nSaltpans\n - \ninn at the crossroads\n \n \nNavigation:\nBrienne VI\n↑\nCersei VIII\n ←\nBrienne VII\n→ \nJaime VI\n↓\nBrienne VIII\nSynopsis\nApproaching the \ninn at the crossroads\n, \nBrienne\n's party encounters many corpses hanging from trees, each with a\nchunk of rock salt in their mouths. They surmise that these were some of the men responsible for the \nraid on\nSaltpans\n, probably hanged by Lord \nBeric\n's outlaw band. Reaching the inn, they meet four girls on the porch, and the\noldest addresses them. She asks for silver for a night's lodging, stating the only visitors they get are either sparrows\nor robbers and worse. When Ser \nHyle\n makes an inquiry regarding her tone, the smith approaches and Brienne is\nnearly floored by his resemblance to \nRenly\n. Inside, Brienne plans to leave before dawn with \nPodrick\n only, although\nshe is unsure where to go. At dinner, Septon \nMeribald\n leads a prayer, but \nGendry\n does not participate and returns to\nhis forge. One of the orphan boys tells the septon that it is because he worships the \nLord of Light\n.
