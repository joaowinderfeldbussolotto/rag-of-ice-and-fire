The next day in court he sends \nCleos Frey\n back\nto \nRobb Stark\n with the \nLannister|\n demands for peace. Finally he hears from \nAlliser Thorne\n about the dead coming\nalive, and dismisses the threat. Later, he takes \nGrand Maester\n Pycelle into custody, getting him to confess his role in\nthe death of \nJon Arryn\n, among other crimes.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n passes Ser \nMeryn Trant\n as he enters \nCersei\n’s chambers, where he finds the recently knighted Ser \nLancel\nLannister\n singing to his sister. He complements both, which unnerves Lancel. Tyrion asks Cersei to dismiss Lancel,\nas there is an important matter for them to discuss. She immediately thinks it is about the begging brothers that were\nincarcerated after claiming the gods are punishing everyone for \nJaime\n killing the rightful king. Cersei complains that\nSer \nJacelyn Bywater\n did nothing so she commanded \nVylarr\n to attend to the matter; Tyrion is irritated that Vylarr\ndragged half a dozen scabrous prophets to the dungeon without consulting him but will not fight over it. After he\nasks if the bed she sits on is the one where \nRobert\n died, which she confirms, saying it gives her sweet dreams, he\ntells her that \nStannis Baratheon\n has sailed from \nDragonstone\n, and not to \nKing's Landing\n, but to \nStorm's End\n to \nlay\nsiege\n, and \nRenly Baratheon\n is riding to meet him. Tyrion, however, thinks it will end in battle rather than an\nagreement, since the brothers are too different, yet alike. They laugh heartily and Cersei is so happy she even hugs\nhim. He fills two cups with wine, adding some powder to hers. As they toast, Tyrion wonders if this is the Cersei\nJaime sees, and is almost sorry for poisoning her.\nThe next morning, Cersei is ill, so Tyrion holds audience alone. In the hall, there are both \nLannister\n guardsmen and\nGold Cloaks\n standing across from each other, with \nBronn\n and Ser \nPreston Greenfield\n flanking the throne. In\nattendance are lovely \nSansa Stark\n, the coughing Lord \nGyles Rosby\n, his cousin \nTyrek Lannister\n who recently married\nyoung \nErmesande Hayford\n (he is teased with the nick name “wet nurse”). Ser \nCleos Frey\n approaches, and Grand\nMaester \nPycelle\n announces that they cannot accept Robb's terms. Tyrion then gives Ser Cleos their own terms:\nRobb Stark\n must lay down his sword, swear fealty, and return to \nWinterfell\n. He must free my brother\nunharmed, and place his host under Jaime’s command, to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis\nBaratheon. Each of Stark’s bannermen must send us a son as hostage. A daughter will suffice where there is no\nson. They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court, so long as their fathers commit no new\ntreasons.\nWhen Ser Cleos states that Robb will not agree to these terms, Tyrion continues with:\nTell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock, that soon it will march on him from the west\nwhile my lord father advances from the east. Tell him that he stands alone, without hope of allies. Stannis and\nRenly Baratheon war against each other, and the \nPrince of Dorne\n has consented to wed his son \nTrystane\n to the\nPrincess \nMyrcella\n. As to this of my cousins, we offer \nHarrion Karstark\n and Ser \nWylis Manderly\n for \nWillem\nLannister\n, and \nLord Cerwyn\n and Ser \nDonnel Locke\n for your brother \nTion\n. Tell Stark that two Lannisters are\nworth four northmen in any season. His father’s bones he shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey’s good faith.\n\nThis raises murmurs of delight and laughter from the audience. Ser Cleos asks about the sword \nIce\n and Robb's\nsisters. Tyrion states that he will have the sword when he makes peace and the sisters when Jaime is released. Tyrion\nthen tells Vylarr that Ser Cleos is to also have a Lannister escort since he is a cousin, and that Vylarr is to take all of\nhis guardsmen. This raises concern from Pycelle; Vylarr stands stone still. Tyrion states that the Gold Cloaks and\nKingsguard\n are adequate to protect \nthe king\n and queen. \nVarys\n smiles knowingly, \nLittlefinger\n feigns boredom, and\nPycelle is looking confused.\nTyrion attempts to close the meeting, but Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n speaks up complaining about being ignored. Tyrion\nfeigns ignorance of him being in the city, blaming Bronn for making his friend that he walked \nThe Wall\n with wait.\nSer Alliser wants to speak to the king, but is told he is playing with his new crossbow (which Tyrion has just given\nhim), so Ser Alliser will have to talk with the King’s servants.\nSer Alliser relates\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
