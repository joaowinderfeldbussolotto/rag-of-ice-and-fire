This a\npractice in which a worshiper of the \nDrowned God\n is held below the water until he drowns. The priest then\nresuscitates him. Through this initiation the person is stronger:\n“What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.” —\nAeron Damphair\nGormond Goodbrother\n appears to bring Aeron to Lord \nGorold Goodbrother\n. Aeron initially declines but relents\nwhen the messenger tells him \nthe king\n, Aeron's brother, is dead. During the journey Aeron remembers his brothers.\nHis father married three times. The sons of his first wife died young. The eldest son from his second marriage was\nthe strongest and fiercest of the remaining. Aeron admired Balon although they were not close in their youth.\nWhen they arrive at Lord Goodbrother's hall at \nHammerhorn\n, Aeron demands that everyone in the hall be sent away\nso that he and Gorold Goodbrother can speak privately. Lord Goodbrother insists that his \nmaester\n will stay as well.\nAeron disagrees and prepares to leave, but the maester stops him by informing him that \nEuron Greyjoy\n has occupied\nthe \nSeastone Chair\n. Aeron is shocked. He remembers his brother but with little love. Goodbrother wants advice on\nwhom to support, but Aeron wants to pray first and leaves for \nPebbleton\n.\nAgain Aeron thinks back to his youth. He was not a very religious man but rather a drunken sod. This changed when\nhe fell overboard in a sea battle during \nBalon's Rebellion\n. He almost drowned and became a devoted follower of the\nDrowned God. Aeron has discussed the succession with Balon. Though Balon wanted his daughter, \nAsha\n, to\nsucceed him, Aeron did not agree with having a woman rule the \nIron Islands\n. \nTheon\n is a weakling and probably\ndead. Balon's eldest brother, \nEuron\n, is ungodly and Aeron hates him. Thus Aeron makes up his mind; it must be\nVictarion\n.\nA few days later, Aeron has arrived at \nPebbleton\n and starts to preach. Asha has also claimed the throne. Now\nAeron's followers and a number of lords look to him for advice on whom to support. During his preaching, he finds\nhis inspiration: the Ironmen should elect the king in a \nKingsmoot\n as they did in the old days. Every captain is to go\nto \nNagga's Hill\n on \nOld Wyk\n, the ancient place where the old kings were chosen. Aeron hears his followers take up\nhis call and knows he has done the right thing.\nNavigation:\nPrologue\n ←\nThe Prophet\n→ \nThe Captain of Guards\n↓\nThe Drowned Man\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 2: The Captain of\nGuards\nPlace(s): \nWater Gardens\n - \nSunspear\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Prophet\n ←\nThe Captain of Guards\n→ \nCersei I\nSynopsis\nPrince \nDoran\n has been at the \nWater Gardens\n for nearly two years now, watching the children play in the pools while\ntrying to deal with his gout. Captain \nAreo Hotah\n hears the approach of \nObara Sand\n, eldest of the \nRed Viper\n's \nbastard\ndaughters\n, and bars her from disturbing Prince Doran's rest. Deadly as she may be, she is no match for the Captain,\nbut the Prince calls her into his presence before they come to blows. Obara demands justice for her father, imploring\nPrince Doran to marshal the Dornish army and give half to her so she might march on \nOldtown\n and burn it to the\nground, and the other half to her half-sister Lady \nNym\n to march up the Kingsroad. Doran tells her that his brother\nwas not murdered, but died in single combat, and that Lord \nTywin\n has promised them Ser \nGregor\n's head.\nUnappeased, Obara mocks her uncle for his meekness and stalks off after he tells her to await his word in \nSunspear\n.\nFearing an uprising in Sunspear incited by the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran tells Hotah that he must return to his seat\nat the Palace of the Sun. The Captain reminds him that Princess Myrcella is there, and that Ser \nArys Oakheart\n sends\nletters to Queen \nCersei\n. Hotah thinks that he and the \nKingsguard\n will eventually cross swords, and when that occurs\nthe Captain will kill him.\nThe next morning, the prince and his retinue begin the journey back to Sunspear, but along the way they come upon\nanother of the Sand Snakes. The beautiful \nLady Nym\n is far more tactful than her older half-sister, but no less\nresolved to seek vengeance for her father.
