He organizes a hunt to find them, but grows\ndesperate during the hunt when no trace of Bran and Rickon can be found. When the sun finally goes down, \nReek\noffers Theon a solution to his problem.\nSynopsis\nTheon suddenly wakes up in Eddard Stark’s former bedroom with the girl \nKyra\n sleeping next to him. He tries to\ncalm himself, but as he cannot remember dreaming, he cannot put it down to a bad dream. He gets out of bed, opens\nthe window and looks outside, where all is quiet. He goes back to bed, until he realizes which sound is missing: the\ndirewolves\n. He sends \nUrzen\n, who is guarding at his door, to check up on the direwolves, who have been locked up in\nthe \ngodswood\n. Recalling the day the direwolves had torn the \nwildlings\n who had attacked \nBran Stark\n in the\nwolfwood, the idea of the direwolves running around makes him feel queasy. He wakes up \nWex Pyke\n, who is\nsleeping by the bed, and sends him to check if Bran and \nRickon Stark\n are still in their beds. Wex returns with the\nnews that the two Starks are gone. As Theon finishes dressing, Urzen returns to tell him that the wolves are gone as\nwell.\nTheon gives the order to rouse the castle. As the order is being carried out, he wonders whether \nStygg\n has reached\nDeepwood Motte\n yet, knowing that his sister \nAsha\n might be on her way to Winterfell by now. The people of\nWinterfell are gathered in the yard. Theon angrily thinks that he tried to treat them justly, but that they have repaid\nhim with betrayal.\nUrzen and Black Lorren show Theon that \nSquint\n and \nDrennan\n, who had been guarding the Hunter’s Gate, have been\nkilled. He recognizes Squint’s wounds as having been the work of the direwolves. He surmises that Drennan has\nbeen killed by “the woman”, and realizes she must have had help from someone who freed the wolves. He thinks to\nhimself that he should have killed the direwolves the day he took the castle. He decides to search for the wolves at\ndaylight.\nIn the yard, where \nReek\n informs him that six people are missing: Bran, Rickon, \nMeera\n and \nJojen Reed\n, \nHodor\n and\nOsha\n. Learning \nDancer\n is still in the stables, Theon realizes they escaped on foot, and that they would be slowed\ndown by the fact that Bran would be in the basker on Hodor’s back and that Osha would need to carry Rickon.\nTheon confronts the people of Winterfell, who do not answer his questions.\nReek suggests skinning them, but Theon loudly declares there will be no flaying in the \nnorth\n while he rules\nWinterfell, hoping some of the people at Winterfell will understand that he is the only thing protecting them from\npeople like Reek.\nTheon organizes a hunt on Bran and Rickon, ordering Maester Luwin to accompany them because he does not dare\nto leave Luwin behind in the castle. Little Walder Frey asks to come too, which Theon allows. They leave the castle\nwith eleven men, two boys, and twelve dogs. Reek takes a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack with\nhim, but Theon does not inquire as to its contents. The tracks of the drivewolves, Hodor, and the two Reeds are\neasily found and the dogs find the scent. They venture northwest, into the heart of the wolfswood. Theon considers\n\nthat they might be fleeing to Deepwood Motte, unaware that Asha will be occupying the castle. He bitterly thinks to\nhimself that he’d sooner see them all dead, believing it is better to be seen as cruel than foolish.\nMaester Luwin asks Theon to consider being merciful, not only to Bran and Rickon, but also the Reeds, citing their\nvalue as a hostage against Lord \nHowland Reed\n. Theon agrees to spare them all, including Hodor, if he can, but not\nOsha, who took an oath and broke it.\nThey find the remains of a freshly killed young elk, clearly killed by the direwolves.
