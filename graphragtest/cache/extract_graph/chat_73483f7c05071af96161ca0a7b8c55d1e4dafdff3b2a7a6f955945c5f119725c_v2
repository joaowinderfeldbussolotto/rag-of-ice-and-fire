She is seated\nbetween \nRyman Frey\n and \nRoose Bolton\n during the wedding feast. She remarks to herself how joyless the wedding\nis, and watches as \nRobb\n dances with several of the Frey maids and \nEdmure\n dotes on his soon to be wife, \nRoslin\n.\nCatelyn becomes more wary when she learns that \nOlyvar\n, \nPerwyn\n, and \nAlesander Frey\n are all not in attendance at\nthe wedding. She notices \nMerrett Frey\n trying to drink the \nGreatjon\n under the table, and finally Lord \nWalder Frey\ncalls for the bedding. Robb does not participate as the Greatjon carries a weeping Roslin to the bed chamber.\nSuddenly, things grow more ominous in the hall as \nDacey Mormont\n goes up to \nEdwyn Frey\n and asks him if he\nwants to dance, but he pushes her away violently. The musicians begin to play a new song, which Catelyn\nrecognises to her horror as \"\nThe Rains of Castamere\n\" and sees Edwyn leaving. She takes off after him, and when she\ngrabs his arm, she feels the rings of chain mail beneath. Suddenly, it all makes sense to her; the Freys missing from\nthe wedding and Roslin crying.\nThe musicians turn out to be crossbowmen, and the wedding becomes a slaughter. Catelyn watches in horror as a\ncrossbow bolt pierces Robb's shoulder and another his leg, and he topples over. \nSmalljon\n throws a table over him to\nsave him from three more bolts. \nRobin Flint\n is surrounded by Freys, their daggers rising and falling. Ser \nWendel\nManderly\n is felled by a quarrel through the mouth. Smalljon bludgeons Ser \nRaymund Frey\n across the face with a leg\nof mutton, but when he reaches for his swordbelt, a crossbow bolt drives him to his knees. \nLucas Blackwood\n is cut\ndown by Ser \nHosteen Frey\n. One of the Vances is hamstrung by \nBlack Walder\n as he wrestles with Ser \nHarys Haigh\n.\nCrossbows take \nDonnel Locke\n, \nOwen Norrey\n, and half a dozen more. Young Ser \nBenfrey Frey\n seizes Dacey\nMormont by the arm, who smashes him in the face with a wine flagon. She runs for the door, but Ser Ryman comes\nthrough with Frey men-at-arms and sinks his axe into Dacey's stomach.\nNorthmen begin pouring through the other door, and Catelyn takes them for rescue for half a heartbeat, until one of\nthem decapitates Smalljon. Catelyn realizes that she must try to intervene and save her son’s life, she sees a dagger\non the floor and crawls toward it, determined to kill Lord Walder. Then Robb stumbles to his feet, an arrow in his\nchest in addition to the other two. Lord Walder who, in the midst of slaughter, sits on his throne watching greedily,\nsignals a halt to the music and mocks Robb. Catelyn grabs \nJinglebell Frey\n and puts a dagger to the halfwit’s throat.\nShe begs Walder to spare her son, trade a son for a son. But the old man says, \"that's a grandson... and he never was\nmuch use.\"\nA man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood steps up to Robb, saying \"Jaime Lannister sends his\nregards.\" He thrusts his longsword through Robb's heart, and twists. Catelyn keeps her promise and slits the poor\nhalfwit's throat, and then begins to laugh and shout, while someone says, \"she’s lost her wits,\". Someone else says,\n\"Make an end,\" she is grabbed from behind and feels steel drawn across her own throat.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VI\n↑\nArya X\n ←\nCatelyn VII\n→ \nArya XI\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 52: Arya XI\nPlace(s): \nthe Twins\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya X\n↑\nCatelyn VII\n ←\nArya XI\n→ \nTyrion VI\n↓\nArya XII\nSynopsis\nArya\n and \nSandor\n try to reach the \ncastle\n.

She hears a \nwolf\n howling\nand music she faintly recognizes. The pavilions that the Stark host are celebrating in have been rigged to collapse.\nThe riders from the castle attack the northmen, collapsing the pavilions and setting them on fire.

Arya wants to go the castle where her \nmother\nand her \nbrother\n are but the Hound tells her they are already \ndead\n. Arya tries to run to the castle but the Hound rides\nher down, bringing his great axe down upon her head.\nNavigation:\nArya X\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_73483f7c05071af96161ca0a7b8c55d1e4dafdff3b2a7a6f955945c5f119725c_v2"}
