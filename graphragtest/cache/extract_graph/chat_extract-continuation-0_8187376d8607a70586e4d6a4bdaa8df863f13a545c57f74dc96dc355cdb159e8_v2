Bran insists that he does not know how to fly. The crow asks him if he has\never tried. Bran then asks the crow if he is really a crow and the crow asks Bran if he is really falling. Bran begins to\ncry, but the crow insists the answer is flying not crying and that flying is easy. When Bran mentions that the crow\nhas wings, the crow says maybe Bran does, too. When Bran searches himself for wings the crow tells him there are\ndifferent kinds of wings. Bran asks the crow what he is doing and the crow responds that he is teaching Bran to fly.\nWhen Bran looks down again he can see the whole \nrealm\n and everything in it. In \nWinterfell\n he sees the inhabitants\ngoing about their work and sees the \nheart tree\n in the \ngodswood\n looking back at him. Bran sees his \nmother\ncontemplating a blood-stained knife aboard a \nship\n sailing on the \nNarrow Sea\n, and his \nfather\n pleading with the \nKing\nnear the \nTrident\n. He sees \nSansa\n crying herself to sleep and \nArya\n holding her secrets in her heart.\nAll around his family Bran sees shadows: One as dark as ash with the terrible face of a hound and another in armour\nas golden and beautiful as the sun. Over them all looms a giant armoured in stone, but with only darkness and black\nblood behind its visor.\nIn the far east, Bran sees dragons stirring in the fabled \nShadow Lands\n. Bran turns north to \nthe Wall\n, where he sees\nJon\n sleeping alone and growing cold and hard. Then Bran looks \nbeyond the Wall\n, and beyond the curtain of light at\nthe edge of the world, into what he calls the \"heart of winter\". What he sees there makes him cry. The crow tells\nBran that now he knows why he must live: because winter is coming.\nBran can see spires of ice rising up to impale him and the bodies of a thousand dreamers before him. The crow tells\nBran that he must choose: fly or die. Bran spreads his arms and flies. The crow reacts by pecking at Bran’s face\nbetween his eyes, blinding him.\nSuddenly, the crow dissolves into a serving woman with long black hair. Bran realizes he is in Winterfell. The\nserving woman drops her basin and runs down the steps shouting, “He is awake.” Bran touches the burning space\nbetween his eyes where he was pecked but cannot feel a thing.\nBran’s \ndirewolf\n jumps up onto his legs, but Bran cannot feel it. When his brother \nRobb\n arrives, Bran looks up\ncalmly and says, “His name is \nSummer\n.”\nNavigation:\nBran II\n\n↑\nEddard III\n ←\nBran III\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nBran IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 18: Catelyn IV\nPlace(s): \nAboard the \nStorm Dancer\n in \nBlackwater Bay\n - \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n↑\nBran III\n ←\nCatelyn IV\n→ \nJon III\n↓\nCatelyn V\nCatelyn\n and Ser \nRodrik\n arrive in \nKing's Landing\n by ship. At a secret meeting with \nPetyr Baelish\n and \nVarys\n, Catelyn\nis told the \nassassin's knife\n belonged to \nTyrion Lannister\n.\nSynopsis\nAs their ship \nStorm Dancer\n prepares to dock in \nKing's Landing\n, \nCatelyn\n is joined on deck by Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n.\nCatelyn notes that Rodrik looks much better than he has for days. Rodrik has been chronically seasick throughout\nthe voyage, forcing him to shave his befouled cheek whiskers.\nAfter Captain \nMoreo Tumitis\n leaves them, Catelyn and Rodrik discuss how to go about their investigation of the\ndagger. Catelyn suggests speaking to the \nRed Keep\n's master-at-arms, Ser \nAron Santagar\n, who may recognize the\nweapon. Rodrik reminds Catelyn that they must be careful she is not recognized. This brings Lord \nPetyr Baelish\n, the\nking's \nmaster of coin\n, to Catelyn's mind. Baelish—still known by the nickname “Littlefinger” given to him by her\nbrother \nEdmure\n—was raised with her at \nRiverrun\n as her father \nHoster's\n ward. They had been close until Petyr had\nchallenged Catelyn's betrothed, \nBrandon Stark\n, for her hand. Brandon had only spared Petyr because Catelyn had\npleaded for his life. After his recovery, Petyr had been sent away and Catelyn has not seen him since. Rodrik\nproposes that he go to the Red Keep alone because, without his whiskers, he is unrecognizable even to the few who\nmight know him.\nAfter they disembark, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik move into a modest old inn suggested by the ship's captain.
