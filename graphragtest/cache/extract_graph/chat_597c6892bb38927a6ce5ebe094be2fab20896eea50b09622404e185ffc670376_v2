The old man recognizes Mormont, and\nthe exile recognizes him but cannot place a name. Arstan claims he comes from the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, and squired\nfor a knight of \nHouse Swann\n as a young man.

She is bothered by the killing and\nhead-staking of many of the servants who worked for Lord \nTywin\n, most of them inherited from Lady \nShella Whent\nwho held Harrenhal prior to Lord Tywin. Arya does not wish to reveal herself to the Lord of the \nDreadfort\n, even\nthough she knows the man to be one of \nRobb\n’s banner-men.\nArya overhears a meeting between Bolton and his advisors, mainly \nFreys\n. The Freys believe that Robb will lose, and\nthat they should sue for peace and leave Harrenhal. Bolton states that he is not a man to be undone, like \nStannis\nBaratheon\n was. Arya learns that \nWinterfell\n has fallen and is horrified when she finds out that her brothers are dead.\nBolton dismisses the Freys, and has Arya remove the leeches.\nQyburn\n reads a letter from the Lady \nWalda\n, Bolton’s new wife. Bolton orders the letter burned, and a message sent\nto \nHelman Tallhart\n, who had recently taken \nDarry\n from the \nLannisters\n. Bolton orders him and \nRobett Glover\n to burn\nthe castle and put the people within to the sword in the name of King Robb, and then to strike east for \nDuskendale\n.\nBolton says that both men will wish vengeance for what has transpired to their families and homes in \nthe North\n.\nBolton then announces that he will hunt wolves that day, for he cannot sleep with all the howling at night. That\nevening, Bolton returns with nine dead wolves, and tells Arya that he means to give Harrenhal to \nVargo Hoat\n when\nhe returns to the north. Arya is to remain at Harrenhal to serve the Goat. Outside the tower occupied by the Freys,\nshe hears much shouting within and sees \nElmar\n crying on the steps. The young son of Lord \nWalder Frey\n says,\n\"We’ve been dishonored. There was a bird from the Twins. My lord father says I’ll need to marry someone else.\"\nElmar was promised a princess originally, but whether or not he knows it to be Arya is unknown.\nArya then decides to flee \nHarrenhal\n, and eventually convinces \nGendry\n and \nHot Pie\n to come with her that night. They\nmeet at the \nTower of Ghosts\n, Gendry says the postern gate is guarded, and Arya says she will get rid of the guard.\nShe approaches him openly and tells him that Lord Roose has her giving a silver piece to all the guards for their\nservice. She takes out the coin Jaqen gave her and drops it, when the guard reach for it, she slits his throat and the\nthree ride out through a sally port and away from Harrenhal.\nNavigation:\nArya IX\n↑\nDaenerys V\n ←\nArya X\n→ \nSansa VIII\n↓\nA Storm of Swords\nArya I\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 65: Sansa VIII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VII\n↑\nArya X\n ←\nSansa VIII\n→ \nTheon VI\n↓\nA Storm of Swords\nSansa I\nSynopsis\nSansa\n watches the long procession of heroes and captives being presented before \nthe King\n. \nTywin Lannister\n is now\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_597c6892bb38927a6ce5ebe094be2fab20896eea50b09622404e185ffc670376_v2"}
