The \nbattle of the Blackwater\n is underway and the people in the sept are\nwaiting for the outcome.\nJoffrey\n obliged her to see him off before. He made her kiss \nhis sword\n promising that he would kill \nStannis\n with it.\nSansa hopes that Joffrey will fight himself and get himself killed. She told him that her brother \nRobb\n was always in\nthe thick of the fight. Joffrey replied that he will kill Robb as well.\nIn the sept the people are singing. Sansa sings with them until they start praying for the victory of Joffrey. Silently\nSansa prays for his defeat and goes away. As she leaves for Maegor's Holdfast she can hear the sound of battle.\nWithin the holdfast Sansa enters the Queen's Ballroom, where there is almost every highborn woman in the city,\nalong with a handful of old men and young boys. Sansa notices \nIlyn Payne\n. She asks Cersei why Ser Ilyn has come.\nCersei explains why they need him:\n-\n\"When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him.\"\n-\n\"Won't your guards protect us?\"\n-\nAnd who will protect us from my guards? The queen gave \nOsfryd\n a sideways look. \"Loyal sellswords\nare rare as virgin whores. If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their\nhaste to rip them off. They'll steal what they can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women,\nand stableboys, all out to save their own worthless hides. Do you have any notion what happens when\na city is sacked, Sansa? No, you wouldn't, would you? All you know of life you learned from singers,\nand there's such a dearth of good sacking songs.\"\n-\nTrue knights would never harm women and children. The words rang hollow in her ears even as she\nsaid them.\n-\nTrue knights. The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. \"No doubt you're right. So why\ndon't you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for \nSymeon Star-Eyes\n and Prince \nAemon the\nDragonknight\n to come rescue you, sweetling.

He sees that the city defenders have few enough ships, but the shore is well\nfortified, and dozens of catapults and archers line the walls of the city. Davos is glad to know that Stannis sent\nMelisandre\n back to \nDragonstone\n, because the king feared the commonfolk would say it was the sorceress who won\nthe battle.\nAs they pass two winch towers on either side of the headwaters of the channel entering the \nBlackwater Rush\n, Davos\nfears a chain boom, which he sees exists, but it is not raised. The old sailor is curious, but there is little time to\nconsider what it means. Fighting breaks out, and despite his inexperience, Ser Imry's battle plans seem to be working\nwell, until the barge with the \nwildfire\n in it explodes. The channel turns into a ruin of hundreds of ships, many\nburning from the unquenchable green liquid. Davos goes overboard as hundreds of men on both sides die screaming\nin the green blaze. As the mass of ships and debris begin to float back out towards the bay and Davos hopes he can\nreach the open sea, he sees the great chain boom raised closing off the Blackwater Rush, turning its mouth into the\nmouth of hell.\nNavigation:\nDavos II\n↑\nSansa V\n ←\nDavos III\n→ \nTyrion XIII\n↓\nA Storm of Swords\nDavos I\n\nA Clash of Kings -
