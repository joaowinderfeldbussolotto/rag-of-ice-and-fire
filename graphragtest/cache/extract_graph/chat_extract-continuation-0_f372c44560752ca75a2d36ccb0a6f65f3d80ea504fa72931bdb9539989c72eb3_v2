He then excuses himself and leaves, pondering the dangers of the agreement with Tycho,\nuncertain if the Watch will ever be able to repay the Iron Bank and thus avoid consequences. But Jon knows that\nbetween being bankrupt and dead, he made the right choice. He also takes another moment to marvel on the\nstupidity of the Lannisters; the Iron Bank is notorious for deposing royalty who don't repay their debts and he notes\nthat if Stannis makes a deal with the Braavosi, he will acquire enough money to hire numerous \nsellsword\n companies,\nto bribe as many lords as he needs and keep his men fed, armed and supplied. Jon muses that unless \n\"Stannis is lying\ndead beneath the walls of \nWinterfell\n, he may just have won the Iron Throne\"\n.\nHe goes to sleep but is awoken by \nMully\n, who tells him that a girl has arrived on a dying horse. Jon's thoughts\ninstantly go to \nMelisandre\n's vision and he giddily thinks that \nArya\n may have come to him as prophesied. He also\nthinks about plans to keep Arya safe; she cannot stay at the Wall, for Stannis will just marry her off to one of his\nvassals so as to gain a claim to Winterfell, and Jon doesn't know but fears what Melisandre may want with her-Jon\n\nspeculates that he might be able to convince Tycho to make arrangements to have Arya fostered with some noble\nfamily in \nBraavos\n or the \nFree Cities\n. When he meets her however, to his disappointment Jon sees that the girl in\nquestion is not Arya; she is too old. He recognises her as \nAlys Karstark\n, having met her before when they were both\nchildren, when \nher father\n brought her to Winterfell in hope of negotiating a marriage between her and \nRobb\n. She\nwarns him not to let \nCregan Karstark\n take her back with him when he arrives, as he and his father \nArnolf Karstark\nintend to force her into marrying Cregan. She also learns the truth about her father's execution from Jon and is\nunsurprised to learn that Robb killed him for murdering prisoners in a fit of rage; her father was a brooding man, and\nher uncles are no better.\nAlys asks Jon if there is still a blood-feud between them after the death of her father, but he assures her that men of\nthe Night's Watch hold no grudges. She tells him that after \nJaime Lannister\n killed her two elder brothers and \nher\nbetrothed\n at the \nBattle of the Whispering Wood\n, she and her brother \nHarry\n are the rightful heirs to their titles.\nHowever, Harrion has been a captive for more than a year; Arnolf only declared Karhold for Stannis in the hope it\nwould provoke the Lannisters to execute Harrion. If that happened, Alys would be heir to Karhold, at which point\nCregan would marry her, get a child from her and then get rid of her. Jon offers to write to Stannis about the matter\non her behalf but Alys reveals that the Karstarks are playing Stannis false; they have long been in league with \nRoose\nBolton\n and are only waiting for his word to betray Stannis. Alys entreats Jon to protect her, pleading that he is the\nonly hope she has left.\nNavigation:\nJon VIII\n↑\nDaenerys VII\n ←\nJon IX\n→ \nThe Blind Girl\n↓\nJon X\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 45: The Blind Girl\nPlace(s): \nBraavos\n \n \nNavigation:\nCat of the Canals\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nJon IX\n ←\nThe Blind Girl\n→ \nA Ghost in Winterfell\n↓\nThe Ugly Little Girl\nSynopsis\nArya\n wakes up after \nentering\n into \nNymeria\n again; she remembers being feared, but only when she dreams. Arya is\nstill in the \nHouse of Black and White\n in \nBraavos\n. She has been blinded, to train her to use her other senses:\nrecognize lies from the tone of voice, walk and work without seeing, even fight. She calls herself Blind Beth now.\nShe goes over her list of names, but remembers that that was someone else, not her, not Blind Beth.\nThe \nkindly man\n asks her his usual question about three things she has learned. Arya learns to play the lying game\nwith the \nwaif\n; this time however she is blind, so instead she learns to use tone of voice to hear the lies. Arya has\ngotten better at speaking \nHigh Valyrian\n, though the kindly man insists she learn the languages of \nLys\n and \nPentos\n as\nwell. As she continues to learn her skills as a blind girl, the kindly man tells her that she has five senses and she\nshould learn to use the other four. An acolyte gets into a duel of staffs with her, teasing her throughout the lesson.\nShe reminisces that she liked being the \nCat of the Canals\n; she thinks about when she killed \nDareon\n, the deserter\nfrom the \nNight's Watch\n. The Kindly Man told her that they are not gods to judge who lives or dies, they are just\nservants of \nHim of Many Faces\n.
