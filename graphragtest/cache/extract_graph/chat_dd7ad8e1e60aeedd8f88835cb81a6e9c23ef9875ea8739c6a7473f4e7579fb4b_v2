The Queen Regent evades this by mentioning Robert's deeds at the Trident. She then berates\nLoras\n for teaching Tommen how to ride, but the Kingsguard reminds her that there has been no master-at-arms at\nthe \nRed Keep\n since \nAron Santagar\n was killed. Walking back to her solar, she considers sending for another Dornish\nmaster-at-arms, just to irk the \nTyrells\n.\nIn her solar, \nQyburn\n informs her that Prince \nDoran\n has imprisoned \nDaemon Sand\n for demanding the release of the\nSand Snakes\n, and that \nSylva Santagar\n has been hastily married to the elderly \nEldon Estermont\n. He also tells her that\nboth Daemon Sand and Sylva are close friends of Doran's daughter \nArianne\n. Cersei could not care less, but she is\ninterested to hear of a treasonous puppet show. She commands Qyburn to have the four puppeteers put to death, but\nQyburn wants the women for his \"experiments\". Cersei has already given him \nSenelle\n, but he tells her she didn't last.\nThe Queen Regent recalls her screaming in the darkness when she was down in the \nblack cells\n, but grants Qyburn\nhis test subjects. Later, as she is bathing in preparation for dinner, \nJaime\n arrives with Tommen, who is demanding to\nsee her. The boy king wants his horse tomorrow so that Loras can continue training him, but his mother will have\nnone of it. Jaime mocks her for suggesting that Ser Osmund is thrice the knight Ser Loras is, but Cersei finally\nconvinces her son to wait for a new master-at-arms to be named.\nAs she gets dressed, Cersei recalls her fit of rage when her washerwoman shrunk several of her gowns; but it is\nobvious she is unaware that she is actually gaining weight from all the alcohol. Her guests for dinner are \nFalyse\nStokeworth\n and her husband, \nBalman Byrch\n. It is revealed that \nTanda Stokeworth\n has been thrown from her horse\nand fractured her hip, but Cersei thinks to herself that Tanda will not recover from the wound at her age. Falyse says\nshe was refused hospitality by the \nward of Lord Gyles Rosby\n and that she encountered \nruffians\n on the road. Cersei\ndeftly convinces Falyse and Balman that she fears \nBronn\n is either hiding Tyrion or gathering swords for him, and\nmay mean to try and kill Tommen. They assure her that it was solely Bronn's responsibility for naming \nLollys's\nbastard son \"\nTyrion\n\", but Balman gets the hint that Cersei would like to see the ex-sellsword disposed of, and tells\nher not to worry any further.\nOn her way to bed, Cersei peeks in on Tommen and sees three kittens in bed with him. \nMeryn Trant\n informs her that\n\nMargaery gave them to him. That night, Cersei thinks of Prince \nRhaegar Targaryen\n, and how King \nAerys\n blocked\ntheir betrothal out of spite. When she was 10, her father and her aunt \nGenna\n promised she would be betrothed to\nRhaegar after the \ntourney for King Aerys II\n in \nLannisport\n. She was so happy that she agreed to visit the witch\nMaggy\n the Frog with her friends. They laughed at her prophesies, but that night King Aerys mocked Lord Tywin for\nthinking he would give his son's hand to his servant Tywin's daughter. And after that, Maggy's predictions started to\ncome true, one after another.\nNavigation:\nCersei IV\n↑\nAlayne I\n ←\nCersei V\n→ \nBrienne V\n↓\nCersei VI\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 25: Brienne V\nPlace(s): \nMaidenpool\n - the shore of the \nBay of Crabs\n \n \nNavigation:\nBrienne IV\n↑\nCersei V\n ←\nBrienne V\n→ \nSamwell III\n↓\nBrienne VI\nSynopsis\nReturning to \nMaidenpool\n, \nHyle Hunt\n informs \nRandyll Tarly\n that \nBrienne\n has killed three of the \nBloody Mummers\n.\nTarly again warns her against playing a knight, but Brienne will not give up her mission.
