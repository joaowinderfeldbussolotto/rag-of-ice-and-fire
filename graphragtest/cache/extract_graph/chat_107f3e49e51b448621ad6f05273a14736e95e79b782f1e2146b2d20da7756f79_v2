Ser.\" Brienne has taken up his training, abandoned since \nAron Santagar\n was killed by the mob in \nKing's\nLanding\n. They soon come upon a farmer, his wife and their cart of eggs bound for Maidenpool. As they ride\ntogether, the farmer tells Brienne that the town has been mostly rebuilt, thanks to the hard hand of \nRandyll Tarly\n.\nThe Maid of Tarth hopes she can slip through town without encountering the Lord of \nHorn Hill\n, as she owes him a\ndebt but bears no liking for the man. At the gates of Maidenpool, the captain informs the farmer that he will take his\neggs and wife, forcing Brienne to draw her sword. Outnumbered by the gate guards, she is spared fighting by the\nappearance of \nHyle Hunt\n, a knight highly placed in Lord Tarly's army and a man whom Brienne despises.\nHunt begins to mock her and Brienne warns him that she will sort him out in a melee some day, just as she did Red\nRonnet Connington\n during the melee at \nAshford\n. She asks him the location of the \nStinking Goose\n, but Ser Hyle\ntakes her to see Lord Randyll first. The commander of \nMace Tyrell\n's vanguard is dispensing his harsh brand of\njustice when they come upon him. When she is brought before him, Lord Tarly asks her if she killed \nRenly\n, and then\nstates he should ship her back to \nTarth\n. But Brienne reveals the King's document that \nJaime\n has given her, and she\ninforms Tarly that she is seeking Sansa. He responds that Sansa is not in Maidenpool, nor would she be in \nthe Vale\n,\nas Brienne has also assumed, since \nLysa Arryn\n is dead.\nBrienne is shocked to learn that Sansa's aunt is dead. She heads off to the tavern, sending Ser Hyle off when he\nattempts to apologize for his actions at \nHighgarden\n. Later, awaiting the arrival of \nNimble Dick\n at the Stinking\nGoose, she recalls the hurtful game Hyle and his friends played at her expense. Brienne had gone to Highgarden to\nanswer Renly Baratheon's call to banners, expecting to be ridiculed. But unbelievably, many of the young knights\nshe met (\nBig Ben Bushy\n, \nEdmund Ambrose\n, \nHyle Hunt\n, \nRed Ronnet Connington\n, \nHugh Beesbury\n, \nRichard Farrow\n,\nOwen Inchfield\n, and \nMark Mullendore\n) were exceedingly kind to her, going above and beyond the others to win her\nfavor. Wary of their intentions, Brienne was still vulnerable thanks to hope, but she soon learned the truth. Randyll\nTarly called her before him to reveal what he had learned of their game through his son \nDickon\n. The knights\ninvolved had a burgeoning wager on who could claim her maidenhead. Tarly ended their game, but told her the fault\nlay with herself, claiming her being here encouraged them and that a war host is no place for a maiden.\nWhen Dick Crabb finally arrives, Brienne offers to buy him drinks. Nimble Dick soon launches into his story, egged\non by a steady bribe from Brienne. He explains how he offered to help a frightened fool make it across the \nNarrow\nSea\n. The fool claimed he had two girls with him, but couldn't chance the ports in Maidenpool. So Dick took his coin\nand took him and the girls along the shore to an old, now-unused smuggler's cove, up past \nCrackclaw Point\n. Nimble\nDick agrees to take her there for a large sum of coin, pointing out that he is from the area, and warns Brienne of the\nWhispers\n, a keep built by a mythical ancestor of his, Ser \nClarence Crabb\n.\nNavigation:\nBrienne II\n↑\nThe Soiled Knight\n ←\nBrienne III\n→ \nSamwell II\n\n↓\nBrienne IV\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 15: Samwell II\nPlace(s): \nsailing from \nEastwatch\n to \nBraavos\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell I\n↑\nBrienne III\n ←\nSamwell II\n→ \nJaime II\n↓\nSamwell III\nSynopsis\nSam\n is trying his\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_107f3e49e51b448621ad6f05273a14736e95e79b782f1e2146b2d20da7756f79_v2"}
