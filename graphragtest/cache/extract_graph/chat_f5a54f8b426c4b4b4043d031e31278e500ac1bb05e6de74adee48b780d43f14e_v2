The\nTickler is almost too scary to hate, though. There are times Arya almost forgets that he is coming along with the\nband, as he is completely inconspicuous when he isn't torturing people, just another soldier and actually quieter than\nmost of them. Arya has started whispering to herself the names of the people she hates, she does it every night now.\nIn \nWinterfell\n, she used to pray with her father at the \ngodswood\n and with \nher mother\n in the \nsept\n, but on the road to\nHarrenhal, whispering those names has become the only prayer left to her.\nFinally the trees give way to a more open landscape of hills, streams and fields – and the occasional burnt holdfast.\nAfter another day's march, they get the first glimpse of the towers of Harrenhal rising hard against the blue of the\nlake. Prisoners keep telling each other that things will get better at Harrenhal, but Arya is not sure about this, as she\nremembers \nOld Nan's\n stories about this castle built on fear and with mortar \nBlack Harren\n mixed with human blood,\nbut where he was roasted with all his sons by the dragons of \nAegon the Conqueror\n nonetheless. The castle is only a\nfew more miles off, Arya thinks, yet they walk almost two more days before they reach Lord Tywin's army,\nencamped west of the castle in the scorched remains of a town, the stench from the overflowing latrines greeting\nthem as they approach, telling Arya that the army has been here for some time. The sheer size of Harrenhal makes it\ndeceptive to the eyes from afar, yet the gatehouse of the castle alone is as large as the Great Keep of Winterfell.\nArya can only see the tops of the five immense towers from outside. Seeing their grotesque and misshapen form,\nlooking like an old man's gnarled, knuckly fingers groping for the sky, she now believes every word Old Nan told\nabout how the stones melted and flowed like candle wax, turning into a searing red as they sought out Harren where\nhe hid.\nHot Pie does not want to enter the castle, declaring that there are ghosts within. Chiswyck gives him the choice of\n\njoining the ghosts or becoming one, so he walks in with the rest. In the echoing bathhouse, they have to strip and\nscrub themselves in tubs filled with scolding hot water, the process supervised by two fierce old women who talk\nabout them like they are newly aquired donkeys. When they examine Arya, Goodwife \nAmabel\n is dismayed about\nher feet while Goodwife \nHarra\n has a closer look at the calluses she received while training with Needle. Harra\nbelieves Arya is a farmer's daughter and got them from churning butter. She tells Arya that she can earn a higher\nstation in life if she works hard, but will be beaten if she does not. Asked for it, she does not dare to give away her\ntrue name, nor does she want to use Arry. Thus she says Lommy called her Weasel, the name of the first girl that\ncomes to her mind. Amabel thinks the name is appropriate. She declares that Arya will lose her hair, as it is filled\nwith lice, and will be assigned to the kitchen. Arya says she'd rather tend the horses, thinking that she could steal one\nand escape. Harra slaps her so hard that her lip breaks again and commands her to shut up, as nobody is interested in\nher views. Arya thinks that Harra wouldn't dare slap her if she still had Needle. Amabel explains that Lord Tywin\nhas grooms and squires to look after the horses and that the kitchen would have been a nice place for Arya, as it is\nsnug and clean and one can always find a warm place to sleep there. However, Arya doesn't seem to be smart, so\nthey should give her over to \nWeese\n, Amabel suggests. They send her off with a rough-spun garb and ill-fitting\nshoes.\nWeese turns out to be the understeward for the \nWailing Tower\n, a squat man with a carbuncle on the nose and angry\nred boils at one corner of his lips. He tells the six assigned to him that the Lannisters are generous to those who\nserve them well, a fate none of them deserve. If they do well, they might rise one day as high as he did. However, if\nthey intend to presume on Lord Tywin's kindness, they'll have to deal with Weese. They are told they are not to look\nthe highborn in the eye, are only allowed to speak when spoken to and should not get in Lord Tywin's way. Weese\nsays he can smell defiance, pride and disobedience, and if he does, they'll have to answer for it. All he wants to sniff\nof them is fear.\nNavigation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f5a54f8b426c4b4b4043d031e31278e500ac1bb05e6de74adee48b780d43f14e_v2"}
