Thinking about her daughters whom she had hoped to trade\nfor Ser Jaime, Catelyn agrees. Lord Karstark, however, is unappeased and leaves the room in a fury.\nIn privacy, Robb introduces his mother to his new bride. Catelyn immediately realizes that, as Robb was pledged to\nmarry a Frey, he has insulted the Freys and broken the alliance. But with his \"love is not always wise\" speech Robb\nhas made it impossible to blame him, as Catelyn disobeyed him because of her love for her daughters.\nRobb tells her how he met his wife. He had taken a wound storming \nthe Crag\n, and \nJeyne\n nursed him back to health.\nThe night he was told his brothers were murdered, Jeyne consoled him and they slept together. Robb married her the\nnext morning. As the \nWesterings\n were vassals of \nHouse Lannister\n, Jeyne has taken her family with her to escape the\nrevenge of the Lannisters. Catelyn notices that \nGrey Wind\n is not with her son, because Jeyne is afraid of the wolf,\nand the beast growls whenever her uncle, \nRolph Spicer\n, is near. Catelyn does not like that and convinces him to send\nSer Rolph off on some errand, for Grey Wind should always be near him. She considers what it may take to appease\nLord \nWalder Frey\n after this slight. The loss of the Freys is strongly felt by Robb, and there was nothing that could be\ndone when \nRyman\n and \nBlack Walder\n led their men back to \nthe Twins\n.\nEdmure tells \nhis uncle\n about his victory against the Lannisters but the latter interrupts him and both the Blackfish\nand Robb berate Edmure for his actions. Edmure was told to not to engage the Lannisters because Robb wanted\nthem to come West. His plan was to hold them there so that the Lannisters would be unable to defend \nKing's\nLanding\n against \nStannis Baratheon\n's invasion. Edmure's attack delayed \nTywin Lannister\n long enough for messengers\nto reach him, allowing the Lannister host to turn around, link up with \nMace Tyrell\n's army and arrive at King's\nLanding to turn the tide at the \nBattle of the Blackwater\n. Edmure ruined their whole plan, and admits that he must\nmake amends. Robb plans to retake \nthe North\n, but first he must win back the Freys.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn I\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nCatelyn II\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nCatelyn III\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 15: Jon II\nPlace(s): \nFist of the First Men\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon I\n↑\nCatelyn II\n ←\nJon II\n→ \nSansa II\n↓\nJon III\nSynopsis\nJon\n is observing \nMance\n's host, taking note of all the \ngiants\n and mammoths that make up the army. \nTormund\n is\ntelling Jon some tall tales about himself, when the eagle that was once \nOrell\n rakes Jon's face. \nRattleshirt\n has arrived\nto bring Jon before Mance, this time at the \nFist of the First Men\n.

The situation is still tense. Jon feels that Mance may still have him killed because Jon lied to him\npreviously. Briefly he thinks about attacking Mance but \nYgritte\n saves him by telling them that they are lovers. The\nwildlings\n respect any man who steals his woman, and Rayder informs Jon that he will be leaving with \nStyr\n and \nJarl\non the morrow to climb the \nWall\n.
