To avoid waking her father, they\nadjourn to the balcony. Her uncle comments that the \nred comet\n is now visible by day, and says his men call it the\n“Red Messenger,” though he wonders what the message is. Catelyn says the Greatjon claims it is a red flag of\nvengeance for her husband, while Edmure claims it is a victory omen: a fish in \nTully\n colors, red against blue.\nCatelyn only sees the crimson of House Lannister, but her uncle points out that the comet is neither Lannister\ncrimson nor Tully red, but a smear of blood across the sky. Catelyn asks whose blood, but the Blackfish asks if there\nwas ever a war where only one side bled.\nThe Blackfish explains that the war has spread south to the \nBlackwater Rush\n and north nearly to the Twins. \nMarq\nPiper\n and \nKaryl Vance\n have won small victories, and \nBeric Dondarrion\n is harassing Lord Tywin's raiders and\nforagers. Ser \nBurton Crakehall\n boasted of killing Dondarrion until Dondarrion killed him in an ambush. Catelyn\nremembers that some of her husband's household guard rode with Dondarrion from King's Landing and blesses their\nactions.\nThe Blackfish comments that Dondarrion and \nThoros of Myr\n are clever enough to play hit and run, but Robb should\nnever have permitted the river lords return to their own lands. \nJonos Bracken\n was wounded and lost his heir \nHendry\nreclaiming \nStone Hedge\n, \nTytos Blackwood\n is left with only \nRaventree Hall\n, and young \nLyman Darry\n was killed by\nGregor Clegane\n less than a fortnight after reclaiming \nCastle Darry\n. The Blackfish declares that Clegane's head\nwould make a noble gift for all the people of the realm.\nTalk of heads reminds Catelyn that her husband's remains mounted on spike above the \nRed Keep\n. She reminds her\nuncle that Gregor Clegane is only a servant of Lord Tywin, whom Catelyn believes is the true danger. The Blackfish\nagrees, noting Tywin's wisdom in sitting safe in Harrenhal and living off their harvests and burning what he does not\ntake. In addition to Clegane, Ser \nAmory Lorch\n and a \nQohorik\n \nsellsword\n are also abroad, raping, burning, and\nbutchering. Catelyn knows Edmure will rage at the news. She also admits Robb is restless and may listen if Edmure\nand the Greatjon will urge him to march on Harrenhal. The Blackfish declares that is exactly what Lord Tywin\nwishes, and the first rule of war is to never give the enemy his wish.\nCatelyn recalls the tales of the vast fortress of Harrenhal by the waters of the \nGods Eye\n. King \nHarren the Black\nbeggared the Riverlands and the \nIron Islands\n alike to realize his dream of the highest hall and tallest towers in\nWesteros\n, but thick walls and high towers proved small use against Aegon the Conqueror's \ndragons\n. Harren and all\nhis line perished in the fires that engulfed the fortress. Strong the castle might be, but also cursed, for every House\nthat has held Harrenhal since has come to misfortune.\nCatelyn decides they must dissuade Robb from fighting at Harrenhal. Her uncle then tells her the worst part: Ser\nStafford Lannister\n is gathering a new host at Casterly Rock, though it will be made of sellswords and new recruits\nwho require training. However, Lord Tywin is in no hurry and will wait patiently for his reinforcements. Then\nCatelyn gets an idea: if they confront Lord Tywin with a new threat he might be forced leave Harrenhal. Her uncle\n\nnames Lord Renly, but Catelyn insist that they must call him \nKing\n Renly if they are to ask his help. The Blackfish\nsmiles, but points out that Renly will want something in return. Catelyn replies that he will want what kings always\nwant: homage.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn XI\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nJon I\n ←\nCatelyn I\n→ \nTyrion II\n↓\nCatelyn II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 8: Tyrion II\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion I\n↑\nCatelyn I\n ←\nTyrion II\n→ \nArya III\n↓\nTyrion III\nTyrion\n dines with Lord \nJanos Slynt\n.
