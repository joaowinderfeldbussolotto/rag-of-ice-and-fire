Summer is smaller and warier than \nGrey Wind\n, but Bran thinks he is the smartest. Bran realizes he is\ncrying; he wants to be down there laughing and running. Bitterly, he declares that the \ncrow\n in his \ndream\n lied about\nbeing able to fly.\nOld Nan\n agrees that crows are all liars and offers to tell Bran a story about a crow, but Bran is not in the mood and\nsnaps that he hates her stories. Old Nan explains that the stories are not hers; they \nare\n, before her and after her. Bran\nremembers \nhis father\n telling him that she was called “Old Nan” even when he was a child. Possibly the oldest person\nin the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, Nan has outlived all her own family except the simple-minded stableboy named \nHodor\n.\nBran insists that he hates the stories no matter whose they are. Unperturbed, Old Nan offers to tell a story about a\nboy who hated stories.\nBran does not want any stories; he wants his parents, and to run, and climb, and ride like before. His father had\npromised he could ride a real horse south, but left without him. Bran broods on all the people who have left\nWinterfell\n and seem to have forgotten him. Only \nRobb\n and Rickon remain and even Robb has changed: he never\nsmiles now and is so busy as the lord of Winterfell that he has little time for Bran.\nWhen Nan offers to tell him about \nBrandon the Builder\n, Bran insists that his favorite stories were the scary ones.\nNan replies, “Oh, my sweet summer child, what do you know of fear?” Bran listens intently as Nan begins the story\nof the first time \nthe Others\n came in the darkness of winter. Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell like\nno other, and there came \na night that lasted a generation\n. In that darkness came the Others: cold dead things that\nhated fire, iron, the touch of the sun, and every creature with warm blood. They overran holdfasts and cities and all\nthe swords of men could not stop their advance. Women and children were not spared, and the Others ate the flesh\nof children. This was before the \nAndals\n and the \nRhoynar\n had come, when the \nFirst Men\n lived in the lands they had\ntaken from the \nchildren of the forest\n. The \nlast hero\n of the First Men set out to find the children with his sword, a dog,\nhis horse, and twelve companions. All of the hero’s companions and even his dog died, and he was left in despair of\never finding the children as the Others closed in.\nOld Nan’s story is interrupted by \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n, who tells Bran that he is needed in the Great Hall to greet \nTyrion\nLannister\n and some men of the \nNight’s Watch\n, who are down from \nthe Wall\n with a message from his brother \nJon\n.\nBran complains that he wants to hear the rest of Nan’s story, but Nan tells him that stories can wait. Hodor, the\nseven-foot stableboy, carries Bran down to the hall with Maester Luwin struggling to keep up.\nRobb is sitting in his father’s high seat, wearing his armor with his sword across his lap. Even Bran knows what it\nmeans to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword and can feel the hostility in the room. Robb makes a point of only\noffering his welcome to the Night’s Watch men. The meaning is not lost on Tyrion, who notes that he is not\n\nwelcome and calls Robb a boy. Robb seethes, insisting that he is a lord. Tyrion responds that if that is so he needs to\nshow a lord’s courtesy.\nWhen Bran is brought forward, Tyrion notes that news of his survival was true and declares that Starks are hard to\nkill. Robb declares that the \nLannisters\n had best remember that and lifts Bran into the high seat. Tyrion asks how\nBran fell, but Bran insists that he \nnever\n falls. Maester Luwin is quick to add that Bran does not remember. Tyrion\ncalls this curious, then asks if Bran likes to ride. Immediately, the maester insists that Bran has lost the use of his\nlegs, and so cannot ride. Tyrion responds that with the right saddle and horse even a cripple can ride. Angered, Bran\ninsists that he is not a cripple, but Tyrion retorts that if that is true then he is not a dwarf. Tyrion hands the maester a\npaper containing plans he has drawn up for a saddle for Bran. The maester states that it will work and he should\nhave thought of it himself. Tyrion responds that the idea came easier to him, since the design is similar to his own\nsaddle. Robb is suspicious of Tyrion’s motive, to which Tyrion replies that Jon asked it of him, and he has a weak\nspot for cripples, bastards, and broken things.\nRickon comes in from outside with the three direwolves, who immediately\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d5dc25c796c0767539ad05628411ff120a3b0172c15fafe0b2b9f43efc35c089_v2"}
