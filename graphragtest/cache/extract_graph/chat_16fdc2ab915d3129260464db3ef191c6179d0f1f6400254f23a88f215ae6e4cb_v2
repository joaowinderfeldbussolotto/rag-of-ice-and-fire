Up here he meets \nTorghen Flint\n of the \nfirst Flints\n and \nBrandon Norrey\n, the \nNorrey clan\n chief. Jon tells them\nthat the wildlings are coming through, though they are not happy about it because of past conflicts. He tells them\nthat they must forgive crimes of the past if they are to live together. They are worried about their lands, but Jon tells\nthem the wildlings are to remain on the wall in the abandoned castles.\nBowen Marsh\n sees this agreement as a betrayal of Jon's vows to the \nNight's Watch\n. However, Jon says that he is\nsworn to defend the realms of men and asks him whether the people beyond the wall don't count as men. Thus it is\nhis intent to use all available resources to defend the realm of men against \nThe Others\n.\nNavigation:\nJon X\n↑\nDaenerys IX\n ←\nJon XI\n→ \nCersei I\n↓\nJon XII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 54: Cersei I\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei X\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nJon XI\n ←\nCersei I\n→ \nThe Queensguard\n↓\nCersei II\nSynopsis\nCersei\n is still a prisoner of \nthe Faith\n. She wonders when \nJaime\n will be coming for her, in addition to wondering what\nhas happened to \nLoras Tyrell\n as last she heard, he lay dying from his wounds on \nDragonstone\n. She only ever sees\nthree people which are her gaolers \nSepta Unella\n, \nSepta Moelle\n, and \nSepta Scolera\n. Her last visitor was \nQyburn\n. She\nhates all three of them as much as those she assumes have betrayed her, blaming \nOsney Kettleblack\n, \nOrton\nMerryweather\n, \nHarys Swyft\n, \nAurane Waters\n and \nGrand Maester Pycelle\n. She questions whether she should include\nJaime in that group but will not believe it. He would not abandon her, she assumes.\nShe feels helpless and hates that emotion, and she prays endlessly to the \nSeven Gods\n, since that is what they want,\nbut it helps not. At first she fights with her guards but they are much stronger than she thought, they keep her up\nendlessly, never letting her sleep. Exhausted, she comes to know that she must confess. She asks to be taken to the\nHigh Septon\n to confess, where she admits to extra-marital affairs. She says she has slept with \nLancel\n and the\nKettleblack brothers\n. She insists she did these things because she was afraid for her children and these were her only\nmeans to secure the trust of these men.\nThe \nHigh Sparrow\n still means to accuse her of high treason, incest, regicide, and deicide, all crimes that Osney\nKettleblack admitted Cersei had a part in under torture. She manages to talk her way out of the charges of murdering\nthe previous High Septon and \nRobert\n and bearing false witness against the Tyrell girls, and avoids the charges of\nincest by saying that these are lies that Stannis has made up in order to gain the \nIron Throne\n, which satisfies the\nHigh Septon, since the Faith is eager to condemn Stannis' 'worship of a \nred demon\n'. To get the real truth, though, the\nHigh Septon means to have her tried by the Faith or \ntrial by combat\n, where Cersei would be represented by a knight\nof the \nKingsguard\n. He is unsure of all the crimes she has committed so the only way to pick the truth from the false\nis to let the gods decide.\nShe is allowed a visit by her uncle \nKevan\n who, though angry with her for corrupting Lancel, answers her questions.\nHe tells her that Jaime is missing after his return from \nRaventree Hall\n, having disappeared with an unknown woman,\nthough they assume it is \nBrienne\n. There is word of sellswords appearing all over the south. They do not have the\nstrength to deal with them, though \nMace Tyrell\n does. However, he is unwilling to do so until the matter with his\ndaughter \nMargaery Tyrell\n is settled. Mace Tyrell is now the \nHand\n, \nPaxter Redwyne\n is the king's admiral, and\nRandyll Tarly\n is the justiciar. The Tyrells brought up an army when their daughters were seized, although the High\nSepton has admitted the case against them is weak.\nKevan brings worse news for Cersei. He relays \nBalon Swann\n's news of \nMyrcella\n's loss of an ear, and \nArys\nOakheart\n's death. Though Cersei is insistent that Myrcella's mutilation is \nTyrion's\n doing, she sees a chance in the\nopen position in the Kingsguard, and asks Kevan to approach Qyburn for a replacement.\nNavigation:\nCersei X\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\n\nJon XI\n ←\nCersei I\n→ \nThe Queensguard\n↓\nCersei II\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 55: The\nQueensguard\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_16fdc2ab915d3129260464db3ef191c6179d0f1f6400254f23a88f215ae6e4cb_v2"}
