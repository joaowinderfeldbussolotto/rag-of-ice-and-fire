Varys says that he had a sudden urge to meet Tyrion’s young\nlady and Tyrion realizes that the eunuch is indirectly threatening him. The two exchange some veiled threats before\nVarys asks if Tyrion has seen the red comet. Tyrion replies that he is short, not blind; on the \nkingsroad\n it seemed to\ncover half the sky and outshone the moon. Varys tells Tyrion that on the streets it is called the Red Messenger, \"a\nherald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.” Before Varys leaves, he poses a riddle to Tyrion:\nIn a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a\nlittle man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it’ says\nthe king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do\nit’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me-who lives and who dies?”\nOnce Varys is gone, Shae asks if it is the rich man who lives. Tyrion is not so sure, saying it depends on the\nsellsword. As they climb the stairs to their room, Shae has to wait for Tyrion. Tyrion notes that he still has to look\nup to her even though she is only five feet tall, but he does not mind since she is so sweet. Shae quickly strips and\nthen teases Tyrion that without her he will never be able to sleep in the Tower of the Hand without masturbating,\nand asks if that is why they call it the Tower of the Hand. She drags him to the bed, and they make fierce love.\nAfterwards, Tyrion calls himself a fool; Shae is a whore and only after his coin. When Shae asks what Tyrion will\ndo as Hand of the King, he tells her, “Something Cersei will never expect. I’ll do... justice.”\nNavigation:\nTyrion IX\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nSansa I\n ←\nTyrion I\n→ \nBran 1\n↓\nTyrion II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 4: Bran I\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran VII\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nTyrion I\n ←\nBran I\n→ \nArya II\n↓\nBran II\nPrince \nBran Stark\n contemplates the \nred comet\n and listens to the \ndirewolves\n howling in \nWinterfell\n, wondering about\nthe reasons behind it all. He resents his broken body and the arrival of \nBig Walder\n and \nLittle Walder Frey\n, whom he\nblames for \nSummer\n and \nShaggydog\n being locked up. When he tells \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n about his wolf dreams, Luwin\ngives him a sleeping draught to stop the dreams, but that night he dreams he is Summer trapped in the \ngodswood\n.\nSynopsis\nBran\n prefers the stone window seat to his featherbed. Abed, the walls seem to press close about him. Although he\ncannot walk, climb, hunt, or fight as he once did, Bran likes to watch the lights begin to glow all over \nWinterfell\n in\nthe evening and to hear the \ndirewolves\n sing to the stars.\nOf late, Bran often dreams of wolves. When they howl, Bran feels the direwolves are talking to him, brother to\nbrother. He can almost understand them, as if they are singing in a language he once knew but has forgotten. His\nmother\n’s new wards Big Walder and Little Walder Frey might be afraid of them, but \nOld Nan\n told him the \nStarks\nhave wolf blood, though it is stronger in some than in others. \nSummer\n’s howls are full of grief and longing while\nShaggydog\n’s are savage. Their voices echo around the castle and it sounds as if a whole pack haunts Winterfell,\ninstead of only two where once there were six. Bran wonders if the wolves miss their siblings, too.\nWhen Bran asked why the wolves howl, everyone gave him a different answer. Ser \nRodrik\n the \ncastellan\n had no time\nfor such idle questions, \nFarlen\n the kennelmaster believed it was for freedom, \nGage\n the cook said they wanted to\nhunt, and \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n thought they were howling at the \nred comet\n because they thought it was the moon. When\nBran repeated Luwin’s words to \nOsha\n the wildling, she declared that his wolves have more wit than his maester and\nknow truths Luwin has forgotten. When Bran asked her what the comet meant, Osha replied, “Blood and fire, boy,\nand nothing sweet.” \nSepton\n \nChayle\n thought the comet was the sword that slays the season, which makes sense to\nBran since soon after the \nwhite raven\n came from the \nCitadel\n to announce autumn. Old Nan could not see the comet,\nbut claimed she could smell it and said it foretold \ndragons\n. \nHodor\n only said, “Hodor.”\nStill, the direwolves howl.
