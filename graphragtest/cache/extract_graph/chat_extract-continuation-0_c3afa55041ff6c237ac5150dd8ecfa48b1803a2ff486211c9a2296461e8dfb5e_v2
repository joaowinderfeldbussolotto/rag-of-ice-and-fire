Sansa, thinking about Ser\nDontos rescuing her, tells him that the wildlings frighten her. He responds that they also frighten Joffrey and the\nlickspittles and sycophants who make up his Kingsguard so no one would harm her. When she tells him she would\nprefer sleeping in her own bed and the tower is where her father’s men were slain, and their ghosts give her bad\ndreams, he agrees to have her escorted back to her bedchamber.\nNavigation:\nSansa II\n↑\nCatelyn III\n ←\nSansa III\n→ \nCatelyn IV\n↓\nSansa IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 33: Catelyn IV\nPlace(s): \nA village near \nStorm's End\n - Outside the walls of \nStorm's End\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n↑\nSansa III\n ←\nCatelyn IV\n→ \nJon IV\n↓\nCatelyn V\nCatelyn\n prays to the seven in a sept in a small village. As she prays, the realization comes to her that both \nEddard\nStark\n and \nJon Arryn\n died for their knowledge of \nCersei’s\n incest, and that \nBran\n also knows. She arrives back at \nRenly\nBaratheon\n's pavillion, where \nBrienne of Tarth\n prepares him for battle. She asks Renly to call a Great Council with\nhis brother and \nRobb\n to let Bran tell what he saw. He refuses to support the concept. Then, a shadow kills Renly.\nWhen the guards arrive, it is assumed that Brienne killed him. Catelyn escapes with her, and they join Catelyn’s\nparty to leave.\nSynopsis\nIt is full dark before \nCatelyn\n, Ser \nWendel Manderly\n and Ser \nRobar Royce\n arrive at the village. The sept’s seven\nwalls—one for each god—are cracked and crooked. She enters alone. Catelyn remembers Septon \nOsmynd\n telling\nher every god is one with seven aspects. In \nWinterfell\n, Septon \nChayle\n hung carved masks, but here they are but\nrough chalk drawings. Catelyn prays to the Mother to spare them if she can, and spare her own sons. She wonders if\nEddard Stark\n’s gods ever answered him, and looks around. The Father’s face reminds her of her dying father \nHoster\nTully\n, the Warrior of \nRenly Baratheon\n, \nStannis Baratheon\n, \nRobert Baratheon\n, \nRobb\n, \nJaime Lannister\n, \nJon Snow\n, and\nfor a second she sees \nArya\n. The smoke burns her eyes, and, after rubbing them, she sees her mother \nMinisa Tully\n,\nwho died in childbirth, in the face of the Mother. When her head starts swimming, she realizes she has not eaten\ntoday; food lost its savor when \nNed\n died. Then she thinks she can see \nLysa’s\n face, but the eyes are too hard; it is the\nface of \nCersei\n. She first wonders if Cersei prays to the seven also, and then thinks if Robert, who did not regard\nJoffrey\n with any warmth, knew that the boy was of Jaime’s seed would have put both him and his mother to death\nand few would condemn him. The children born of incest are considered abominations by the followers of both the\nold gods\n and the Seven; only among \nthe Targaryens\n was such practices common. She realises Eddard and \nJon Arryn\nmust have both known, hence why Cersei had them both killed, and she suddenly realizes \nBran\n knows also. She\nprays to the different gods for her children. Ser Robar interrupts her prayers to tell her they must leave to be back\nbefore dawn.\nThey pass through the army, and to Catelyn it seems like grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners. At Renly’s\npavilion, Ser \nParmen Crane\n and Ser \nEmmon Cuy\n of the \nRainbow Guard\n stand guard outside while inside, \nBrienne of\nTarth\n is armoring the king and Lords \nRandyll Tarly\n and \nMathis Rowan\n are speaking of dispositions and tactics.\nCatelyn asks to speak to Renly, but he tells her to wait. Lord Mathis is telling Renly that they should advance before\ndawn since the soldiers are in position, and Lord Rowan is agreeing since if they wait, they will charge into the\nrising sun, but Renly will not have it said his victory was won by treachery. Renly is sure that Ser Loras will break\nthe first of Stannis' lines. Renly commands that when his brother falls, his body be treated with respect. When Lord\nTarly asks what to do if Stannis yields, both Renly and Lord Rowan are amused, and Renly recounts how Ser\nGawen Wylde\n tried to escape to surrender to \nMace Tyrell\n during the siege of \nStorm's End\n, and Stannis was going to\nhurl him out using a catapult. He was only dissuaded by Maester \nCressen\n telling him they might have to eat their\ndead; mercifully, the \nOnion Knight\n saved them from having to eat the flesh of corpses, though Renly notes
