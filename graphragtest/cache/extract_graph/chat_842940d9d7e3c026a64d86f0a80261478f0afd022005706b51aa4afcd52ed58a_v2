Victarion kills \nTalbert Serry\nof \nSouthshield\n, and the ironborn's massive fleet is soon victorious in their conquest of the Shield Islands which sit at\nthe mouth of the \nMander\n River north of the Port of \nOldtown\n. It is Victarion's command that won the battle, but it\nwill be King \nEuron\n they cheer for engineering their bold attack. Back in his cabin, as the \ndusky woman\n Euron gave\nhim tends his wounds, Victarion recalls \nAeron\n's words that he would find a way to remove Euron from the \nSeastone\nChair\n. He remembers how he had helped capture Lord \nBaelor Blacktyde\n, who had refused to acknowledge Euron\nand paid for it with his life. \nAsha\n, however, had escaped the Iron Islands along with those loyal to her.\nLanding at \nLord Hewett's Town\n on \nOakenshield\n, the Lord Captain meets the \nReader\n and the \nDrumm\n. Both are\nworried that Euron's little conquest will bring ruin down upon them, as surely \nHighgarden\n will respond. At the feast,\nVictarion notes that Euron has shamed Lord Hewett and his wife and daughters. The recently crowned king then\nraises \nHarras Harlaw\n, \nAndrik\n the Unsmiling, \nMaron Volmark\n and \nNute\n the Barber to Lords of the four Shield\nIslands, effectively stealing away the lieutenants of his adversaries.\nEuron declares that they will sail the next day with provisions plundered from the Shield Islands; selling the slaves\nthey had just taken in the \nFree Cities\n on their way to find the dragons he had promised. But many of the captains\nobject, stating that they should attack Oldtown or the \nArbor\n, and Euron stalks from the hall. Soon, one of Euron's\nbastard sons tells the Iron Captain that the king wishes to see him.\nIn his room, Euron tells his brother that the Reader was correct that the whole fleet could never reach \nSlaver's Bay\ntogether. But he believes that the Iron Fleet alone could, and promises his brother the Seastone Chair as reward if he\nsails to \nSlaver's Bay\n and returns with \nDaenerys\n. Euron means to marry her and ascend to the \nIron Throne\n. With \nLord\nBlacktyde's\n words that \nEuron was maddest of them all\n on his mind, Victarion agrees to go, thinking to himself,\nYou stole \nmy wife\n and despoiled her, so I'll have yours.\nNavigation:\nThe Iron Captain\n↑\nCersei VI\n ←\nThe Reaver\n→ \nJaime IV\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 30: Jaime IV\nPlace(s): \nDarry\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime III\n↑\nThe Reaver\n ←\nJaime IV\n→ \nBrienne VI\n↓\nJaime V\nSynopsis\nJaime\n's small host reaches Castle \nDarry\n, and he finds himself contemplating the genius of his uncle \nKevan\n for his\nchoice of a bride for \nLancel\n, \nAmerei Frey\n, whose mother is a \nDarry\n.\nHe has dispatched \nRed Ronnet\n to accompany \nWylis Manderly\n to \nMaidenpool\n, but nevertheless he has too many men\nto be fed at his cousin's new castle. Jaime takes note of all the armed \nFreys\n and \"sparrows\" in the castle, far\noutnumbering Lannister men. Darry's maester greets Ser Jaime, surprised by this unexpected visit, and tells him that\nKevan departed right after the wedding, and that Lancel is praying in the sept. The maester provides him with\nLancel's own room, since Jaime's cousin has taken to sleeping in the sept. As Jaime bathes before the guest feast, he\nnotices that \nJosmyn Peckledon\n, his new squire, wishes to bed \nPia\n. Jaime tells him to use Lancel's room for his first\nbedding, saying, \"You'll feel a lord yourself when you're done, if Pia knows her business.\" But Jaime warns him to\ntreat her kindly, perhaps due to his own guilt for refusing the girl when \nQyburn\n sent her during his recuperation at\nHarrenhal\n.\nAt the feast, Jaime learns that his cousin has been fasting since the old \nHigh Septon\n died.
