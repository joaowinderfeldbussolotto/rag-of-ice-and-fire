Pycelle states that he has seen more of illness than he would like to remember and\nthat every illness is different and yet alike. Eventually, Pycelle says that Jon Arryn’s death was no stranger than any\nother. When Ned mentions that Lysa thinks otherwise, Pycelle says that grief can derange minds--and Lysa’s mind\nwas not the best before, seeing enemies in every corner.\nWhen Ned suggests that Jon Arryn could have been poisoned, the Grand Maester rebuffs him, asking who would do\nsuch a thing. Ned replies that he has heard poison is a woman’s weapon. Pycelle replies that poison is the preferred\nweapon of women, cravens, and eunuchs. He continues by telling Ned that \nVarys\n was born a slave in \nLys\n, and that\nNed shouldn’t trust him. Ned scarcely needs reminding, as he already has a bad feeling about Varys.\nNed excuses himself but the Grand Maester halts him to offer any other service Ned may require. Ned uses the\nopportunity to ask for the book Jon Arryn asked for. Pycelle says it is a ponderous tome of lineages that Ned would\nfind boring. Ned insists he would like to see the book in any case, and Pycelle promises to send it to him once he\nfinds it. On the way out, Ned also learns that Queen \nCersei\n was not in \nKing's Landing\n when Jon Arryn died.\nPycelle’s parting words are “I am here to serve,” leading Ned to think, “Yes, but whom.”\nOn his return to the \nTower of the Hand\n, Ned finds \nArya\n on the steps, standing on one foot. When Ned asks what she\nis doing she tells him that \nSyrio Forel\n says that a \nwater dancer\n can stand on one toe for hours. Ned expresses his\nconcern about her falling down the steps but Arya states that a water dancer never falls. Then Arya asks if \nBran\n will\n\ncome to live with them now, and Ned responds that first he must grow stronger. Speaking of Bran leads Ned to\nrecall taking the girls to the castle \ngodswood\n to offer their thanks when the news of Bran’s recovery arrived. The\ngirls had gone to sleep and dreamed of Bran while Ned stood vigil all night.\nWhile balancing on her leg, Arya asks about Bran’s plans to be a knight of the \nKingsguard\n. Ned admits that Bran\nwon't become a knight, but he may become a lord, a councilor, an architect, an explorer, or even the \nHigh Septon\n,\neven while privately noting that Bran will never lie with a woman or father a son. When Arya asks if she can do any\nof these things, Ned says that she will marry a king and her sons will do these things. Arya replies that that is \nSansa\n,\nnot her.\nLater, Ned meets with \nLittlefinger\n in his solar. Littlefinger, who is watching the Kingsguard practicing in the yard\nbelow, starts with small talk about who might win the tourney. This does not interest Ned at all, so he asks\nLittlefinger to get to the point. Ned cannot find it in himself to trust Littlefinger. Littlefinger tells him that four of\nJon Arryn’s household are still in the city, which surprises Ned, who thought that all had gone back to the \nEyrie\n with\nLysa.\nLittlefinger reveals the names, which include Jon Arryn's squire, Ser \nHugh\n of the Vale. He also reveals that Ser\nHugh was knighted by the king after Lord Arryn died. Ned states that he will send for them, but Littlefinger does not\nthink this is a good idea and asks Ned to come to the window. Littlefinger identifies some of the spies among those\noutside his window: one is Varys’, the other is the queen’s. He tells Ned that there are others, and some even he does\nnot know. He cautions Ned to send a man he trusts completely to question these people rather than doing it himself;\neven Varys cannot watch every man in Ned's service every hour of the day. As Littlefinger departs, Ned expresses\nhis gratitude and says he was perhaps wrong to distrust him. Littlefinger fingers his beard and replies that distrusting\nhim is the wisest thing Ned has done since he climbed down off his horse.\nNavigation:\nEddard IV\n↑\nBran IV\n ←\nEddard V\n→ \nJon IV\n↓\nEddard VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 26: Jon IV\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon III\n↑\nEddard V\n ←\nJon IV\n→ \nEddard VI\n↓\nJon V\nSamwell Tarly\n appears in the yard while \nJon\n is training the other recruits.
