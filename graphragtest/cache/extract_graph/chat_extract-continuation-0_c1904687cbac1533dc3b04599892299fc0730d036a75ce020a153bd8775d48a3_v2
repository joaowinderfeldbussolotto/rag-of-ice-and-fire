Bran can see that Osha is still alive. Stiv commands Osha to kill the wolves, but\nshe refuses to go anywhere near them. Instead, Stiv orders Robb to kill the wolves. Bran screams “No,” knowing\nthat they will be defenseless without the wolves. Suddenly an arrow from Theon Greyjoy’s bow bursts through\nStiv’s chest and the man collapses into the stream.\nThe Stark guardsmen appear and Osha throws down her spear and surrenders. The guardsmen grow pale and some\neven vomit when they see the carnage. Theon, ever smiling, is proud of his shot, but Robb scolds him for taking\nsuch a chance with Bran’s life; he might have missed or the knife could have slipped. Then Robb turns on the\nguardsmen, asking where they were. They explain that at first they were waiting for Maester Luwin and Theon\nadmits he lead them off to hunt a turkey. Robb is angrier than Bran has ever seen him.\nAs Maester Luwin examines Bran’s wounds he points out to Robb that two of the attackers wear the black of the\nNight's Watch. Robb orders their heads cut off for transport back to \nthe Wall\n, but orders the bodies left unburied.\nThe question of what to do with Osha comes up. The woman drops to her knees to beg Robb to spare her,\nproclaiming that she will serve him. When Robb asks what use he might have for an oath-breaker, Osha insists that,\nas a \nwildling\n, she broke no oaths. Theon suggests that they give her to the wolves, which causes Osha to shudder\nand even some guardsmen to look queasy. Maester Luwin advises that they question her, so Robb orders her bound\nand brought back to Winterfell.\nNavigation:\nBran IV\n↑\nDaenerys IV\n ←\nBran V\n→ \nTyrion V\n↓\nBran VI\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 38: Tyrion V\nPlace(s): \nThe \nEyrie\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion IV\n↑\nBran V\n ←\nTyrion V\n→ \nEddard X\n↓\nTyrion VI\nTyrion\n is held captive in one of the \nEyrie\n’s \nsky cells\n. Eventually he bribes the \njailer\n to take a message that he is\nready to confess. When brought into the high hall, Tyrion manages to convince Lady \nLysa Arryn\n to give him a trial\nby combat and the sellsword \nBronn\n declares he will be Tyrion’s champion.\nSynopsis\nThe ugly and sadistic jailer \nMord\n brings beans for \nTyrion\n, who is in one of the \nEyrie\n’s \nsky cells\n. As always, when\nTyrion reaches for the plate, the oaf pulls it away and holds it over the edge of the cell, telling Tyrion to come get it.\nTyrion is unwilling to step that close to the edge and Mord lets the plate fall. Tyrion curses Mord, who gives him a\nkick before he leaves.\nTyrion crawls to the corner to huddle under a thin blanket that has replaced the \nshadowskin\n cloak stolen by Mord.\nTyrion reflects that he would gladly trade the cold and open sky cell for the dankest pit in \nCasterly Rock\n. When\nMord placed Tyrion in the cell he promised that, sooner or later, Tyrion would fly. To make things worse, the floor\nslants towards the opening, making Tyrion afraid to sleep, lest he slip towards the edge.\nTyrion remembers when \nLysa Arryn\n announced to her court that Tyrion had slain \nJon Arryn\n, the \nHand of the King\n.\nThat was when Tyrion put his foot in it, remarking “Oh, did I kill him too.” He went on to wonder aloud when he\nwould have had enough time to do all this killing. He should have been silent but he had been in a foul mood, having\nbeen humiliated by having to be carried the last leg of the climb to the Eyrie by \nBronn\n. Lysa warned him about\nwhere he was but he threatened them with the wrath of \nJaime Lannister\n all the same. He even declared his threat a\npromise and drove sickly young Lord \nRobert Arryn\n into a frenzy. It was only the intervention of \nCatelyn Stark\n that\nsaved him from being made to fly when she insisted that Tyrion was her prisoner. Then he was sent to the sky cells.\nTyrion thought that they would not dare kill him out of hand, but now he is not so sure. He is getting weaker every\nday and it is only a matter of time before Mord’s kicks do him serious harm. He is sure that \nhis father\n will have sent\nriders out by now and Jaime might already be leading an army to rescue him. \nCersei\n might get King \nRobert\n to sit in\njudgment himself, which even \nEddard Stark\n could not object to. Tyrion is sure he can win a trial since the \nStarks\nhave no proof.\nTyrion wonders which of his siblings sent the footpad to kill \nBran Stark\n and if they also conspired in the death of\nJon Arryn\n. If Arryn was murdered it was subtly done, whereas sending a footpad to kill Bran was unbelievably\nclumsy. This leads Tyrion to wonder\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROBB<|>PERSON<|>Robb is a Stark who commands the guardsmen and makes
