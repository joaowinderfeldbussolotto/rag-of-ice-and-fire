Their camp is made\nbehind a stone ring built by the \nFirst Men\n during the \nDawn Age\n.\nAs they climbed, \nGhost\n ran off, and Jon had to keep calling him back, but the commander finally grew impatient and\ntold Jon to let him go. Jon Snow can tell the travelling is wearing on the Lord Commander, but he tries not to let it\nshow.\nAfter putting up the Lord Commander’s tent and seeing to the horses, he descends to find Ghost, who suddenly\nappears next to him. He feels a growing sense of foreboding. He climbs some rocks from where he can see the\nMilkwater\n river and the rugged landscape giving way to high stony hills to the north. When darkness starts to arrive,\nJon is interrupted by \nSamwell Tarly\n. Jon tells Sam that the commander plans to stay here and wait for \nQhorin\nHalfhand\n and the men from the \nShadow Tower\n, and he should get a raven ready since the commander will want to\nsend a message. Sam states the ravens hate being caged, and if he could fly he would be back at \nCastle Black\n and be\neating pork pie.\nThey return to camp. Overhead, the red tail of \nMormont’s Torch\n is as bright as the moon. When they arrive, Jon\nleaves to attend to the Lord Commander. Mormont, who is talking to some of his officers, tells Jon to bring some\nhot spiced wine. As he prepares the wine, he hears \nJarman Buckwell\n state that following the Milkwater would be the\neasiest road to the \nFrostfangs\n, but \nMance Rayder\n will know of their approach. Ser \nMallador Locke\n recommends\nGiant's Stair\n or \nSkirling Pass\n. Mormont states he does not want to risk the Frostfangs unless he must. He plans to\nremain at the Fist since the \nWildlings\n outnumber them, and the Wildlings will have to come from the Frostfangs\neventually for food; they will strengthen their defenses. The rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river\nsince Mormont is sure that \nCraster\n did not lie to them about Mance gathering his force in the Frostfangs. The\nofficers finish their wine and leave.\nJon offers the commander supper, and he asks if Ghost found any game since they could use meat, and then asks if\nJon agrees with keeping the rangers close. Jon replies that if they stay close, they are unlikely to find his uncle\nBenjen Stark\n. The commander responds that it would be easier for one man to find 200 than for 200 to find one, and\nthe land is too vast to search with their limited manpower. They have left a very visible trail, and the fires on the Fist\nshould be visible to the foothills of the Frostfangs. Jon then brings up the case that his uncle is dead, and the\ncommander replies that he still may return anyway as a \nWight\n. The commander then tells Jon he will forsake supper\n\nand to wake him at first light.\nHowever, Jon is hungry, and joins \nDywen\n, \nGrenn\n, \nDolorous Edd\n, and \nHake\n for the stew. Dywen states there is a\nsmell he does not like, a smell of cold. Jon hears a howling and then Ghost appears, surprising Jon since he has\npreviously refused to come inside the ring. Ghost seems preoccupied, sniffing the air. Suddenly Jon is alarmed since\nGhost knew when the dead came walking, and Dywen has said he smelled cold. Ghost starts to go, and then looks\nback, so Jon follows, leaving the protection of the ring. Ghost stops at the stream, and then goes on, so Jon follows,\nangry. He loses Ghost a quarter of the way around the Fist. When he catches up with Ghost again, he is digging at a\nmound that has been dug only recently. He expects to find a body, but finds a bundle two feet across. Inside the\nbundle made from a cloak of the \nNight's Watch\n, he finds \nDragonglass\n weapons.\nNavigation:\nJon III\n↑\nCatelyn IV\n ←\nJon IV\n→ \nBran V\n↓\nJon V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 35: Bran V\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran IV\n↑\nJon IV\n ←\nBran V\n→ \nTyrion VIII\n↓\nBran VI\nBran\n learns of his brother's victory, and the death of Ser \nStevron Frey\n, and realizes that \nJojen Reed\n's prophesy has\ncome true.
