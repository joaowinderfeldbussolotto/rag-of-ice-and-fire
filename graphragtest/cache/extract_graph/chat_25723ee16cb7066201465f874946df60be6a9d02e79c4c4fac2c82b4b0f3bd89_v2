It is time he tried another hawk, a red hawk.\nNavigation:\nArya III\n ←\nDavos I\n→ \nTheon I\n↓\nDavos II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 11: Theon I\nPlace(s): \nAboard the \nMyraham\n, \nLordsport\n and \nPyke\n \n \nNavigation:\nDavos I\n ←\nTheon I\n→ \nDaenerys I\n↓\nTheon II\nAfter an absence of ten years, \nTheon Greyjoy\n arrives back home on the island \nPyke\n aboard the \nMyraham\n. He docks\nat \nLordsport\n and is disappointed to discover that his father, Lord \nBalon Greyjoy\n, has send only Theon’s uncle \nAeron\n,\na priest of the \nDrowned God\n, to escort him to \nBalon’s castle\n. At Pyke, Theon is greeted coldly by his father, after\nwhich he presents Balon with \nRobb Stark\n’s letter. Balon rejects the proposed alliance with Robb, instead insisting\nthat he will \npay the iron price\n and carve out a kingdom of his own.\nSynopsis\nTheon Greyjoy\n is aboard the \nMyraham\n, which is taking him to \nhis father's\n \ncastle\n on \nPyke\n. Although there is no safe\nanchorage, Theon insists the \nMyraham\n pass by the castle so he can watch his home rise just as it dwindled when he\nwas taken away as a ward of \nEddard Stark\n ten years before. Theon is unable to make out the banner above the \nSea\nTower\n, but he knows it is the golden kraken of \nHouse Greyjoy\n. In the sky beyond the castle, the \nred comet\n is still\nvisible. Theon decides it is his comet, sliding a hand to the letter from \nRobb Stark\n that he considers as good as a\ncrown. The \ncaptain's daughter\n asks Theon if the castle is as he remembers it and he confesses it looks smaller. He\nthen gives the captain permission to make for port at \nLordsport\n and takes the girl below deck, where he has her\nsatisfy him orally. The girl asks to come ashore with him, to be his \nsalt wife\n, but Theon rebuffs her, explaining that\nthe days of the \nOld Way\n are gone and that her place is on the \nMyraham\n, despite her protests that her father will hit\nher for having slept with Theon.\nIn the harbor of Lordsport, Theon notices at least fifty or sixty longships including those of Houses \nGoodbrother\n,\nWynch\n, and \nHarlaw\n. Theon considers why his father has called the banners, wondering whether it is because of\ncaution, or whether Lord Balon had anticipated as to why Theon was finally coming home after all these years.\nFrom aboard the ship, Theon discovers there is no honor guard to escort him to Pyke. As they make port the captain\nof the Myraham announces him, but the waiting merchants are unimpressed and do not recognize him. He orders a\nhorse from an innkeeper, but their conversation is interrupted by a priest of the \nDrowned God\n, who says he will\nescort his nephew to Balon's castle. Theon does not recognize the grim, bearded priest until he remembers his father\nwriting that his uncle \nAeron Greyjoy\n had gone down in a storm and turned holy after the near-death experience.\nTheon finds that Aeron's cold manners are totally unlike the amiable man he remembers from his youth. Abruptly,\nAeron asks if Theon prays to the \nStark\n \ngods\n now, and Theon (who seldom prays at all) says no. Aeron commands\nhim to kneel in the mud and drenches his head with seawater from a waterskin, reconsecrating him to the Drowned\nGod.\nAeron informs Theon that his \nmother\n now lives on \nHarlaw\n because of her health and his sister \nAsha\n has taken her\nship, \nBlack Wind\n, to \nGreat Wyk\n with messages from her father. Theon asks why his father has assembled his forces,\nbut Aeron insists Balon commanded secrecy. When Theon protests, stating he has a right to know as Balon's heir,\nAeron replies \"\nwe shall see\n\" to that, stating that, although Balon has no other sons but Theon, he does have a\ndaughter. When Theon furiously replies that he will not allow himself to be cheated out of his birthright by a\nwoman, Aeron comments that Theon is a fool if he believes that Balon will ever hand over the \nIron Islands\n to a\nStark, making Theon realize that, although he was never truly accepted by the Starks, he is now neither truly\naccepted by his own family, either.\nThey reach Pyke at sunset, from where Aeron departs immediately. Theon is brought to his chambers by \nHelya\n, who\ninforms him that Balon awaits him atop the Sea Tower. Theon dresses richly before leaving to meet his father. Balon\nis smaller, gaunter, and greyer than Theon remembers him. Balon asks what Theon is now, and Theon replies he is a\n\nman and Balon's heir. Balon only says they will see. Balon criticizes Theon's clothing and asks if the gold\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_25723ee16cb7066201465f874946df60be6a9d02e79c4c4fac2c82b4b0f3bd89_v2"}
