Daenerys reveals the name of her son: \nRhaego\n, in honor of her \nolder brother\n.\nKhal Drogo leads her out of the pit with his \nbloodriders\n behind, followed by the rest, down the godsway. As they\nwalk, Drogo asks about the name of their son and Daenerys explains about her brother, a fierce warrior who died\nbefore she was born; the last of the dragons. Drogo declares that it is a good name.\nEventually they arrive at the lake called the \nWomb of the World\n. Here Daenerys strips out of her soiled clothing and\nenters the lake. She cleanses her face and body of the dried blood. When she emerges from the lake, \nDoreah\n brings\nher a robe of sandsilk, but Drogo waves her away. Daenerys can see his manhood through his trousers and helps him\nunlace; with three quick strokes, he is done.\nThey ride down the godsway to Drogo’s tent-hall where there is a great feast prepared for those too low of rank to\nattend the ceremony. As Dany rides up the aisle, the crowd hails the life within her. When she dismounts, Daenerys\ncannot find \nViserys Targaryen\n. She sees Ser \nJorah Mormont\n in a place of respect in the midst of the hierarchy and\ninvites him to her own table.\nWhen Ser Jorah arrives she asks about Viserys. He explains that her brother went to the market to find wine.\nDaenerys then questions why he was allowed to go alone since \nthe Usurper\n would pay well for his head. Ser Jorah\nassures her that Viserys should be safe, as nobody can carry a blade or shed a man’s blood in \nVaes Dothrak\n.\nDaenerys states that men still die; some of the merchants have huge eunuchs to strangle thieves bloodlessly. Ser\nJorah declares that her brother should be wise enough not to steal anything. The knight goes on to explain that her\nbrother was going to steal her dragon eggs until he threatened to cut off Viserys' hand. Daenerys declares that she\nwould have given Viserys an egg if he had asked: she does owe him for their survival and he is all she has left of her\n\nfamily. Jorah tells her that she belongs to the Dothraki now.\nDaenerys asks Ser Jorah about the Stallion Who Mounts the World. He explains that the Stallion is the \nkhal\n of \nkhals\n,\nwho is prophesized to unite the Dothraki into a single \nkhalasar\n and lead them to conquer the world.\nDoreah interrupts Daenerys to point out her brother entering the hall in rags, drunk, and carrying a sword. Angry\nmutterings rise all around her and the music dies away. Daenerys has a sense of dread and asks Ser Jorah to stop him\nand bring him to her. Viserys starts screaming for Daenerys and reproaching the indignity of starting the feast before\nhis arrival. Ser Jorah is quickly by his side and tries to stop him, but Viserys jerks free. Then he moves to sit with\nDrogo and the other \nkhals\n.\nDrogo rises and declares through translation that Viserys’ place is not on the high bench but at the back where the\nlowest of the low sit shrouded in shadow so that others do not have to look upon them. Viserys declares drunkenly\nthat that is no place for a king, but Drogo emphasizes that it is his place, mocking him as the Sore-foot King and the\nCart King. Viserys draws his blade, angering the Dothraki.Then he spots Daenerys and stalks over. She begs him to\nthrow away the sword but Viserys ignores her. Viserys demands his crown or else he will take Daenerys back, but\nhe will be happy to cut out her child and leave it for Drogo. To emphasis his point, Viserys presses his sword against\nher belly hard enough to prick her navel through her silks.\nJhiqui\n is sobbing in fear, stating that she dare not translate Viserys’ words; if she does she fears Khal Drogo will\ndrag her behind his horses up the \nMother of Mountains\n. Daenerys agrees to translate instead. After hearing the\ntranslation, Drogo makes a statement in Dothraki and steps down from the high bench with his bloodriders. Viserys\nasks and Daenerys translates: “You shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.” Viserys\nsmiles and declares that that is all he ever wanted. His smile is what saddens Daenerys the most.\nDrogo orders his bloodriders to seize the man who was her brother, breaking his arm and taking away his sword in\nthe process. Drogo puts his belt of golden medallions into an emptied stew pot. Viserys finally realizes what is\nhappening and begins to plead and struggle. Ser Jorah tells Daenerys to look away, but she refuses. When the gold is\nhalf melted, Drogo declares “Crown for Cart King!” and upends the pot over Viserys’ head. Soon it is over; not a\ndrop of blood is spilled. Daenerys thinks, surprisingly calmly, that Viserys was no dragon, because fire cannot kill\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DAENERYS<|>PERSON<|>Daenerys is a prominent figure who reveals the name of her son, Rhaego, and interacts with Khal Drogo and other characters in the narrative)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>PERSON<|>Khal Drogo is a powerful leader of the Dothraki who leads Daenerys and interacts with her throughout the events)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHAGO<|>PERSON<|>Rhaego is the son of Daenerys, named in honor of her older brother)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISERYS TARGARYEN<|>PERSON<|>Viserys Targaryen is Daenerys' brother, who is involved in a conflict with Khal Drogo and meets a tragic end)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>PERSON<|>Ser Jorah Mormont is a knight who advises and assists Daenerys, providing her with information and support)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOREAH<|>PERSON<|>Doreah is a servant who attends to Daenerys, bringing her a robe and pointing out Viserys' actions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JHIQUI<|>PERSON<|>Jhiqui is a servant who fears translating Viserys' words due to potential consequences from Khal Drogo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE USURPER<|>PERSON<|>The Usurper is a figure who would pay well for Viserys' head, indicating a political or historical context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOODRIDERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bloodriders are loyal warriors who follow Khal Drogo and assist in his actions, including seizing Viserys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAES DOTHRAK<|>GEO<|>Vaes Dothrak is a location where the events take place, including the feast and the confrontation between Viserys and Khal Drogo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOMB OF THE WORLD<|>GEO<|>The Womb of the World is a lake where Daenerys cleanses herself and has a significant interaction with Khal Drogo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER OF MOUNTAINS<|>GEO<|>The Mother of Mountains is a location mentioned in the context of potential punishment for Jhiqui)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STALLION WHO MOUNTS THE WORLD<|>EVENT<|>The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy about a leader who will unite the Dothraki and conquer the world)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHALASAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A khalasar is a group of Dothraki people united under a single leader, as mentioned in the prophecy)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>KHAL DROGO<|>Daenerys is in a close relationship with Khal Drogo, who leads her and interacts with her throughout the events<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>RHAGO<|>Daenerys names her son Rhaego in honor of her older brother<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>VISERYS TARGARYEN<|>Viserys Targaryen is Daenerys' brother, who she interacts with and ultimately witnesses his tragic end<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>Ser Jorah Mormont advises and assists Daenerys, providing her with information and support<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>DOREAH<|>Doreah attends to Daenerys, bringing her a robe and pointing out Viserys' actions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>JHIQUI<|>Jhiqui is a servant who fears translating Viserys' words due to potential consequences from Khal Drogo<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>BLOODRIDERS<|>Bloodriders are loyal warriors who follow Khal Drogo and assist in his actions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>VISERYS TARGARYEN<|>Khal Drogo has a conflict with Viserys Targaryen, leading to his tragic end<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISERYS TARGARYEN<|>THE USURPER<|>The Usurper would pay well for Viserys' head, indicating a political or historical context<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>VISERYS TARGARYEN<|>Ser Jorah Mormont interacts with Viserys Targaryen, trying to stop him and bringing him to Daenerys<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VAES DOTHRAK<|>WOMB OF THE WORLD<|>Vaes Dothrak and the Womb of the World are locations where significant events take place<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STALLION WHO MOUNTS THE WORLD<|>KHALASAR<|>The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy about a leader who will unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
