He can feel the ground underfoot and the smells fill his head. The scent of squirrel reminds him of the taste of\nhot blood and bones cracking between his teeth. Slaver runs from his jaws, and he can hear the squirrel chittering\nand rustling safe above him. He can smell his brother, too, loping around and around, tirelessly searching but never\nfinding: for prey, for a way out, for his mother, for his littermates, for his pack.\nBehind the trees the walls rise higher than any wolf can leap. Cold iron and splintery wood close off the only exits,\nbut his brother still stops at each one to fruitless bare his fangs in rage. He did the same the first night, but learned it\nwas no good; circling the walls will not push them back and marking the trees will keep no men away. The world\nhas tightened around them, but beyond the wall still stands Winterfell, and beyond that the true world calls him, and\nhe knows he must answer or die.\nNavigation:\nBran VII\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nTyrion I\n ←\nBran I\n→ \nArya II\n↓\nBran II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 5: Arya II\nPlace(s): \nAn inn on the \nkingsroad\n.\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya I\n↑\nBran I\n ←\nArya II\n→ \nJon I\n↓\nArya III\nArya\n and the others encounter more refugees every day as they journey north. One evening they halt at an inn,\nwhere they hear news of the war in the \nriverlands\n. Outside the inn, Arya talks with the prisoner \nJaqen H'ghar\n. Soon\nafter, six \ngold cloaks\n arrive with an arrest warrant for the \nBull\n, but \nYoren\n refuses and after a tense standoff the gold\ncloaks retreat.\nSynopsis\nEach day, \nArya\n and the others travel from dawn to dusk, and at night they eat by the light of the \nRed Sword\n. The\nmen take turns standing watch, since they can see the firelight of other travellers. Every night there are more camps\nand every day there is more traffic on the \nkingsroad\n. They meet every kind of person and every mode of\ntransportation, but most come by foot, with their goods on their shoulders and wary looks on their faces. They are all\nheaded south toward \nKing's Landing\n, and Arya wonders why no one else is going north like them.\nOne morning, a passing merchant offers to buy \nYoren\n’s wagons for a quarter of their worth. He explains there is war\nto the north and claims Yoren will do better selling to him than being robbed by soldiers, but Yoren refuses. That\nsame day, Arya notices the first grave (dug for a child) and a few leagues on \nPraed\n points out a whole row of them.\nAfter that hardly a day passes without seeing one.\nOne night, Arya wakes to find the night oddly quiet. When Praed does not wake the next morning, Arya realizes it\nwas his coughing that was missing. They bury the sellsword where he slept and split his valuables amongst them.\nYoren gives the longsword to the Bull, claiming he has the arm to learn to wield it.\nThat evening they stop in a village at an ivy-covered inn. They cannot afford rooms, but Yoren arranges a hot meal\nand use of the bathhouse if anyone feels the need. Arya knows she must smell as bad as Yoren, but cannot risk\nrevealing her gender by bathing. She rationalizes that it would be a shame to drown the creatures living in her\nclothes that have come all the way from \nFlea Bottom\n. The \nBull\n, \nTarber\n, and \nHot Pie\n line up for the bathhouse with\nsome of the other men while the rest crowd into the common room. Yoren even sends \nLommy\n out with tankards for\nthe three men who remain fettered in the wagon.\nThe innkeeper gives them all a round of beer on the house and tells them his brother \nLync\n was sent to the \nWall\n for\nfilching pepper from his \nlord\n’s table. Arya sips her beer cautiously, remembering how she enjoyed beer when her\nfather permitted it and how \nSansa\n would make a sour face and insist wine was ever so much finer. The memories\nmake her sad.\nThe inn is full of refugees who scorn Yoren’s plan to continue north. The innkeeper explains that half the fields are\nburnt, and the remaining people are walled up in holdfasts. Yoren insists that the \nNight’s Watch\n takes not part, but\nthe innkeeper points out that \nwild men\n have come down from the \nMountains of the Moon\n and the \nyoung Lord Stark\nhas come south to war. Mention of her brother grabs Arya’s attention. A man named \nHod\n claims that Robb rides\ninto battle on a wolf as big as a horse, which no one seems to believe.\nThen talk turns to the great pack of wolves near the \nGods Eye\n who have even attacked men, led by a she-wolf from\nthe seventh hell. Talk of a she-wolf makes Arya wonder if the Gods Eye is near the \nTrident\n, where she was forced to\n\nleave her \ndirewolf\n \nNymeria\n. One of the travellers claims that this she-wolf once snatched a baby from its mother’s\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_36c7281dc1ad007a621133178860a1dc60b3297cda2a6b81a07fe44c65ffd15c_v2"}
