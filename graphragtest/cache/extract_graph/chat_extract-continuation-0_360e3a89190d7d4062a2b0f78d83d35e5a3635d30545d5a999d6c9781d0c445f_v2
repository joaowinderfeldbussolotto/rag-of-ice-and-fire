He was only dissuaded by Maester \nCressen\n telling him they might have to eat their\ndead; mercifully, the \nOnion Knight\n saved them from having to eat the flesh of corpses, though Renly notes this was\nlittle comfort for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell. Renly, assuming Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n will be with Stannis (since\nSer Barristan is neither with him nor with Robb and wants to guard a king), states he wants him spared. Finally,\nRenly is ready to hear from Catelyn, the lords departing.\nCatelyn now tells Renly that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran, explaining that there was a hunt the day he fell, and\n\nwhile Robert, Ned and most of the other men were gone, both Jaime Lannister and the queen remained at Winterfell.\nShe then beseeches Renly to set aside the crown, along with his brother, and Robb would do the same. Then they\ncould call a \nGreat Council\n where Bran will tell his tale so the realm will know the Lannisters are true usurpers.\nRenly tells her the time for talk is done. As Brienne is kneeling, belting on Renly’s long sword and dagger, a breeze\nseems to fling open the tent flap. Then, Catelyn sees \na shadow lifting a sword\n that takes Renly in the throat. Brienne\ncatches Renly as he stumbles into her, his blood flowing over her armor. Ser Robar and Ser Emmon come rushing\nin, and, seeing Brienne covered in Renly’s blood, immediately assume she killed him. Ser Emmon immediately\nattacks with a battleaxe as Catelyn screams “No!”. Brienne is soon in battle with Ser Emmon and the two men-at-\narms with them. Catelyn starts to tell Ser Robar, who hangs back uncertainly, that is was Stannis, only being able to\nexplain it as some sort of sorcery, a shadow, swearing on her husband’s grave and her honor. Ser Robar promises to\nhold them off and leaves the tent. Brienne has taken out the men-at-arms but now the armored Ser Emmon is in her\nwool. Catelyn bashes an iron brazier over Ser Emmon’s helm, sending him to his knees and Brienne, seeing the\nchance, slashes through the tent side. Catelyn tells her to follow her slowly so they do not raise suspicions.\nBrienne has seen nothing, and Catelyn tells her it was a shadow, and she could feel Stannis. Brienne swears she will\nkill Stannis with Renly’s sword. They arrive at the camp, and Catelyn explains that Renly is dead, and there will be\nno battle. She tells Brienne to select one of the many spare horses; they have to be far away before they look for\nthem, so she does not have time to get her own armor and horse. Catelyn tells them to ride, and cut down anyone\nthat tries to stop them.\nCatelyn thinks how all of Renly’s power will now belong to Stannis, won in a single evil stroke; the lords present\nwill have no choice but to side with the last Baratheon. Then she thinks how Stannis has also declared Robb a traitor\nwho must be punished, and a chill goes through her as she recalls Stannis's threat that Robb's time will come.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n↑\nSansa III\n ←\nCatelyn IV\n→ \nJon IV\n↓\nCatelyn V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 34: Jon IV\nPlace(s): \nFist of the First Men\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon III\n↑\nCatelyn IV\n ←\nJon IV\n→ \nBran V\n↓\nJon V\nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n's men reach the \nFist of the First Men\n. The Lord Commander plans to reinforce the stone\nring built by the \nFirst Men\n during the \nDawn Age\n to wait for men from the \nShadow Tower\n here, and then to wait for\nMance Rayder\n to return from the \nFrostfangs\n. \nGhost\n finally joins \nJon Snow\n in the ring, surprising Jon since Ghost has\npreviously refused to come into the ring. Ghost leads him to some buried \nDragonglass\n weapons wrapped in a cloak\nof the \nNight's Watch\n.\nSynopsis\nLord Commander \nMormont\n's men arrive at the \nFist of the First Men\n. \nJon Snow\n thinks that it actually looks like a fist\nplunging up from the ground. The commander tells \nThoren Smallwood\n it is good ground, and he replies it is an old\nplace that is strong and will be easy to defend. The commander agrees they are not likely to find a better place to\ndefend. Its disadvantage, pointed out by Jon, is that they will have to climb down to get water. Their camp is made\nbehind a stone ring built by the \nFirst Men\n during the \nDawn Age\n.\nAs they climbed, \nGhost\n ran off, and Jon had to keep calling him back, but the commander finally grew impatient and\ntold Jon to let him go. Jon Snow can tell the travelling is wearing on the Lord Commander, but he tries not to let it\nshow.\nAfter putting\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
