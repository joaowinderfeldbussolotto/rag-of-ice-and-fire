Littlefinger suggests bribes, but both Varys and Tyrion\ndo not think gold will win \nHighgarden\n. Littlefinger admits they are right, and states that Loras, although a younger\nson, is \nMace Tyrell\n’s favorite, so they just have to win him. Tyrion suggests marrying 15- or 16-year-old Margaery\nto the 13-year-old Joffrey. Cersei objects that Joffrey is promised to \nSansa Stark\n, but Tyrion responds that there is no\nadvantage in wedding the king to the daughter of a \ndead traitor\n. Littlefinger adds that the Tyrells are wealthier than\nthe \nStarks\n and Margaery is lovely and beddable.\nWhen Tyrion states that Joffrey should like this, Cersei replies her son is too young to care about such things. Tyrion\nnotes that he was the same age as Joffrey when he married. Cersei insists that Joffrey is made of finer stuff, but\nTyrion reminds her that he ordered Sansa stripped by Ser \nBoros Blount\n.\nTyrion has spoken to Varys about arranging a secret visit to \nChataya\n’s for Joffrey; Tyrion hopes that it will sweeten\nhim. He noted that they will have to arrange to do it when \nSandor Clegane\n is busy. Varys agreed to look into the\nmatter.\nTyrion tells Cersei that the marriage may be the only way for Joffrey to live to his wedding night and Littlefinger\nadds that Sansa brings only her body to Joffrey’s bed, while Margaery would bring 50,000 swords. Varys adds that\nthe needs of the realm come before the king’s own desires. Cersei states that the king would never agree to Renly’s\nleavings, and Tyrion replies that when the king comes of age in 3 years he can make his own decisions, but until\n\nthen he does as the \nHand of the King\n and the regent say. Cersei agrees but warns them if Joffrey does not like\nMargaery.\nTyrion brings up the need to send one of them to Bitterbridge before Loras’ blood cools; Loras will scarcely deal\nwith \nBronn\n or \nShagga\n. Cersei first recommends Ser \nJacelyn Bywater\n, but Tyrion points out that whoever they send\nmust be able to make decisions for the king and council. Cersei recommends Tyrion as \nHand of the King\n and Tyrion\nrecommends Cersei as the king’s mother. Littlefinger volunteers, stating he would make a poor hostage and neither\nLoras nor Mace bears any enmity towards him. Tyrion does not like it since he does not trust Littlefinger but if he\nleaves \nKing's Landing\n for any time, everything he worked for would be undone. There is fighting on the route to\nBitterbridge, so Littlefinger will need a strong escort. Tyrion initially offers 100 \ngold cloaks\n and they agree on 300\nplus 40 knights with squires to give Littlefinger a knightly tail to impress the Tyrells. Littlefinger states he will take\nHoras Redwyne\n and \nHobber Redwyne\n (Horror and Slobber) who will be sent on to their father as a gesture of good\nwill since \nPaxter Redwyne\n is an old friend of Mace Tyrell's. Cersei expresses wrath at this since \nHouse Redwyne\nwould have declared for Renly except for the twins being held hostage. Littlefinger notes that Renly is dead and\nStannis and Lord Paxter have an enmity against each other from the siege of Storm's End. Tyrion decides to send Ser\nHobber and keep Ser Horas in King’s Landing. Littlefinger also demands plenty of horses and gold, and a\ncommission in writing, which Tyrion agrees to, so Littlefinger states he will start before dawn, but is expecting a\nsuitable reward for his services. Cersei asks him what he wants, and Littlefinger replies he will think about it. Tyrion\ninstructs Varys to get parchment and quill, and they will need someone to wake Joffrey.\nCersei asks Tyrion about his chain, and he tells her it is getting longer link by link, and that they should thank Ser\nCortnay since Stannis will not march north with Storm’s End untaken. Cersei now tells Tyrion that he has been a\ngreat help, contrary to what she expected, and kisses him on the brow.\nWhen Cersei leaves, Tyrion tells Bronn that Cersei is up to something, and asks Bronn to try to find out what;\nTyrion hates surprises.\nSee Also\nNavigation:\nTyrion VII\n↑\nBran V\n ←\nTyrion VIII\n→ \nTheon III\n↓\nTyrion IX\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 37: Theon III\nPlace(s): \nStony Shore\n \n \nNavigation:\nTheon II\n↑\nTyrion VIII\n ←\nTheon III\n→ \nArya VIII\n↓\nTheon IV\nAt the \nStony Shore\n, \nTheon Greyjoy\n and his men have won an easy victory against a force led by \nBenfred Tallhart\n.\nFeeling dissatisfied, Theon meets\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5798568ad1513d8eb134b4ecbafcb7303703f9253819e8dddfae007b43f0acec_v2"}
