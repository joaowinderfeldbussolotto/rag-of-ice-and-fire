Dany learns of \nthe fall of Astapor\n, and that many inhabitants have contracted the \nbloody flux\nwhile under siege, with the survivors now fleeing towards Meereen. The survivors also say that they believed and\nwaited everyday for Daenerys to come and save them. She tells them that they will be safe in Meereen now. Dany is\nadvised not to let the survivors and their illness into the city, and reminded again of \nEroeh\n and of how sometimes\nthose whom she tries to save end up worse off.\nThere are further appeals to use the dragons, however they are followed with comments that they cannot be\ncontrolled right now, and even the \nUnsullied\n are afraid to go into the dragon pit to feed them. Dany says she cannot\nand will not unleash the dragons at this point in time. Ultimately she decides not to let the Astapori into the city and\nthat they should have a separate camp outside the city until the flux passes.\nSer Barristan appeals to her to take the battle to the enemy. She then reminds herself that a queen represents her\npeople and not just her own person. She thus decides that she cannot have the Unsullied take the field or else she\nwould have to leave the \nBrazen Beasts\n alone to defend against the Sons of the Harpy which will not suffice. She\nthen says that she must marry Hizdahr, for the good of the city.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys IV\n↑\nDavos IV\n ←\nDaenerys V\n→ \nMelisandre\n↓\nDaenerys VI\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 31: Melisandre I\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys V\n ←\nMelisandre I\n→ \nReek III\nSynopsis\nMelisandre\n is in her chambers, looking into the fire and trying to receive her visions. When she looks for Stannis,\nshe sees eyeless faces staring out, crying blood. Then she sees towers by the sea followed by skulls rising out of the\nocean turning to mist and great winged beasts flying in the sky. She tries to see the girl on the fleeing horse again as\nshe knows \nJon\n will want to know more, but she cannot find anything. She does see that there is death around Jon\nand that dangers and enemies lurk all around him.\nWhen \nDevan\n asks her what she sees, she replies with her usual answer \"Much and more.\" She does not let him know\nhow difficult it is or how much pain she endures to try and see these things, for fear of letting others know that this\ntask is not as simple as she lets on. Melisandre knows and sees that \nDavos\n is the most loyal to \nStannis\n thus she has\nkept Devan back against the young boy's wishes. She knows that Davos has lost too many sons already and although\nStannis has ridden out, she keeps the boy in order to save one of Davos' sons.\nMelisandre does not sleep much, often just an hour a night, as she fears to dream and what she sees there, re-\noccurring images of the words \"Lot Seven\" and \"Melony\".\nShe sends Devan to go get \nRattleshirt\n and bring him to her. She speaks with him and tells him to keep his bones on,\nin order to keep the \nglamor\n spell active. She also asks that he go and fetch the girl she saw on the dying horse. She\ntells him of her vision and asks him where the girl might be coming up, and, knowing the North well, he can guess\nher location, west of \nLong Lake\n. Their talk is disrupted by the single long drone of a horn, marking the return of the\nrangers. She tells Rattleshirt to wait for him there and she goes to see the rangers, thinking of her prediction of three\ndead rangers.\nUpon arrival she sees Jon with the heads of \nBlack Jack Bulwer\n, \nHairy Hal\n and \nGarth Greyfeather\n, impaled on\nspears. She walks with Jon and they go back to her room. There he sees Rattleshirt, but she removes the glamor to\nshow him that he is actually \nMance Rayder\n, whom she has spared. She tells him that he will bring Jon back his\nsister, but Jon mistrusts her. She does not reveal the difficulty of her glamor spell to the men, thinking to herself that\nthe more effortless sorcery appears, the more men fear it and her.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys V\n ←\nMelisandre I\n→ \nReek III\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 32: Reek III\nPlace(s): \nBarrowton\n \n \nNavigation:\nReek II\n↑\nMelisandre I\n ←\nReek III\n→ \nTyrion VIII\n↓\nThe Prince of Winterfell\nSynopsis\nBen Bones\n, \nSkinner\n, \nSour Alyn\n, and \nDamon Dance-for-Me\n return to the \nkeep\n of \nHouse Stout\n from a search for some\nFrey\n men with \nRamsay Bolton\n. \nTheon\n knows this means that Ramsay may want to take his anger out on someone,\nmost likely Reek.
