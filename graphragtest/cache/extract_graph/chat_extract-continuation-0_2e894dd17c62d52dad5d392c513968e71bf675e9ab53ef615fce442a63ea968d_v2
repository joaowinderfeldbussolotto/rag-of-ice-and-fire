Then he remembers what he promised\nOsha, and tells the maester of the threat in the north. The maester promises to talk to Osha, but it is obvious even to\nBran that what he has said has made little impression.\nTwo days later, Robb and his army march south. Robb tells Bran that now he must be the lord, the Stark in\nWinterfell. Bran—who has never felt so little, alone, or scared—does not know how to be a lord. He is told to listen\nto Maester Luwin and to take care of Rickon who has refused to say goodbye, claiming that no one ever comes back.\nRobb states that Mother will be home soon and promises to bring Father back. As Robb’s force leaves, Bran\nremembers Osha’s words: he is marching the wrong way. Then he hears the cheers from the village, and thinks they\nwill never cheer for him. All that seems to be left in Winterfell are women, children, old men, and Hodor.\nNavigation:\nBran V\n↑\nJon VII\n ←\nBran VI\n→ \nDaenerys VI\n↓\nBran VII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 54: Daenerys VI\nPlace(s): \nVaes Dothrak\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys V\n↑\nBran VI\n ←\nDaenerys VI\n→ \nCatelyn VIII\n↓\nDaenerys VII\nDaenerys\n is unable to convince \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n to assault the \nSeven Kingdoms\n to regain her throne. While Drogo is\nhunting, Daenerys goes to the market where a wine merchant offers her a cask of wine. When Ser \nJorah\n insists that\nthe merchant drink first, the merchant refuses and attempts to flee. When Drogo learns of the attempt to poison\nDaenerys, he makes the decision to attack the Seven Kingdoms.\nSynopsis\nAfter taking his pleasure, \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n arises from the sleeping mats and declares that the \nStallion Who Mounts the\nWorld\n has no need of an \niron chair\n. \nDaenerys\n reminds him that it is prophesized that the Stallion will ride to the ends\nof the earth, but Drogo responds that the earth ends at the black salt sea, which no horse can drink. Daenerys tries to\nexplain ships to him, but Drogo is not interested and leaves to go hunting. She can only hope that if his hunting goes\nwell he might return in a more receptive mood; maybe he will even kill a \nhrakkar\n, the white lion of the plains.\nAlthough he is brave even by Dothraki standards, like all his people Drogo still fears the sea.\nDaenerys sends for Ser \nJorah\n. When he arrives, she pleads for help convincing her husband to ride west. Ser Jorah\nexplains that Drogo has never seen the \nSeven Kingdoms\n and probably thinks of them as small islands like \nLys\n or\nLorath\n; the riches of the east seem a lot more tempting. He continues that she should have patience and not make \nher\nbrother\n’s mistake. Ser Jorah promises that eventually they will go home. The word “home” saddens her when she\nremembers that the Seven Kingdoms are a place she has never seen either, and she wonders if the \ndosh khaleen\n is\nher future.\nIn an attempt to cheer her up, Ser Jorah asks if she would like visit the \nWestern Market\n, where a great caravan has\njust arrived and may carry a letter from Magister \nIllyrio\n. Daenerys likes this idea since it will be nice to see the\ntreasures, to hear the sound of the \nValyrian\n language, and (since Drogo is gone) to travel in a litter; she does not\nwant to appear weak in front of her husband by not riding a horse.\nDaenerys finds the market quiet compared to the bazaars of the \nFree Cities\n. The caravans come from east and west\nnot so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other. The Dothraki do not fully understand the concept of\nbuying and selling, but the merchants are welcome as long as they do not disturb the peace or profane the \nMother of\nMountains\n and give the traditional gifts to the \ndosh khaleen\n. Daenerys enjoys the wonder and magic of the \nEastern\nMarket\n, with its strange foods and people, but the Western Market reminds her of home. She tells Ser Jorah about\nhow she loved to play in the bazaars of the Free Cities when she was a little girl even though they seldom had\nmoney to buy anything. She especially remembers the honeyfinger cakes of \nTyrosh\n. When she asks if they have\nsuch cakes in the Seven Kingdoms, Ser Jorah is unable to say.\nSer Jorah asks her pardon to seek out the merchant captain to ask about letters from Illyrio, but when Daenerys\noffers to join him he is insistent that he go alone. Daenerys finds this curious and wonders if the knight plans to visit\na brothel afterwards. Daenerys wanders joyfully around for half of the morning, even laughing for the first time\nsince her brother’s death. As per Dothraki custom she receives several items as gifts and reciprocates with\nmedallions from her belt.\nTurning a corner, they come upon a wine merchant offering thimbles of wines.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>Winterfell is the ancestral home of House Stark, where Bran remains as the
