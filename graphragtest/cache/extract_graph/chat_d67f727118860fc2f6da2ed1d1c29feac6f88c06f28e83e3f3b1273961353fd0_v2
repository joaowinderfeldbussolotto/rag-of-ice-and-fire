The Pureborn are interested only in her dragons, not in her cause. She again beseeches\nXaro for ships, but the merchant prince tells her he has no warships. He asks her again to marry him, and she again\nrefuses. She considers going to the \nWarlocks\n for aid, and again Xaro warns her not to. As they move through the\nmarketplace, Daenerys witnesses a firemage make a ladder of fire and climb it into the sky, as cutpurses move\nthrough the astonished crowd. Xaro declares the feat a fine trick, but \nQuaithe\n appears and tells them it was no trick.\nThe shadowbinder tells Daenerys that half a year ago, the man could scarcely make even a small fire appear, but his\npower has grown now, and all because of Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons. Quaithe warns, \"You must leave this\ncity soon…or you will never be permitted to leave it at all.\" Daenerys realizes that Quaithe wants her to go to\nAsshai\n, and when she asks why, the shadowbinder tells her it is there she will find truth. Her khas warn her not to\ntrust the Asshai’i shadowbinder, and Xaro concurs. Later, Ser \nJorah\n tells her she will find no help in \nthis city\n. He\nexplains why Xaro wants to marry her: During a Qartheen wedding ceremony, the bride and groom each ask one\nthing from each other that the other cannot refuse. Ser Jorah is convinced that Xaro plans to obtain one of her\ndragons in this way. He tells her she should go east, but not to Asshai. When Daenerys suggests returning west to\nIllyrio\n, Jorah warns her that the Magister cares only for himself and would provide no help. Daenerys believes he\nwill give her the ships and soldiers to retake \nWesteros\n, but Jorah states, \"Nothing knits a broken realm together so\nquick as an invading army on its soil.”\nHe reminds her that a man was sent to kill her when \nRobert Baratheon\n heard that she was pregnant, and fears what\nmight happen when word spreads of her dragons. Daenerys wonders why the comet led her to Qarth if not to obtain\nships and an army, and Ser Jorah implores her to go to \nPyat Pree\n for help.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nCatelyn V\n ←\nDaenerys III\n→ \nTyrion IX\n↓\nDaenerys IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 41: Tyrion IX\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VIII\n↑\nDaenerys III\n ←\nTyrion IX\n→ \nDavos II\n↓\nTyrion X\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n, the royal family, and their retainers are at the docks to see Princess \nMyrcella\n off to \nDorne\n. Tyrion is sending\nArys Oakheart\n with her as her \nsworn shield\n. Prince \nDoran Martell\n has promised to move his banners into the high\npasses once Myrcella is safely at \nSunspear\n.\nTyrion knows one of \nCersei\n’s secrets, how she is consorting with the unsavory hedge knight \nOsmund Kettleblack\nand his brothers in order to raise her own force of sellswords. What the Queen doesn’t know is that \nBronn\n is\nmatching every copper she gives the \nKettleblacks\n, thus Ser Osmund is really one of Tyrion’s men. On the ride back\nto \nMaegor's Holdfast\n, things get out of hand when someone in the crowd hits \nJoffrey\n in the face with dung, and the\nking sends \nthe Hound\n to deal with the perpetrator. The crowd, frenzied due to the lack of food and the harsh living\nconditions, boils over and begins to trample the procession. Sensing what is about to happen, Tyrion screams for\nthem to ride hard for the gates of the Holdfast. In the mad rush, several members are lost, and by the time Tyrion\nreaches the safety of the gates, their lives are in doubt.\nAs Joffrey is ranting about traitors and how they attacked him, Tyrion dismounts and slaps him so hard his crown\nflies off, and then shoves him to the ground, shouting, \"You set your dog on them! What did you imagine they\nwould do?\" Tyrion commands Ser \nBoros\n and Ser \nMeryn\n to return and find \nSansa\n and those missing, and when the\ntwo \nKingsguard\n balk, Cersei begins to berate them as well for their cowardice. Sansa returns, saved by Sandor\nClegane who is covered in blood. Meanwhile, a fire has broken out in the city, and Tyrion can see the fear in the\nHound's eyes when he commands the men to go and put out the fire.\nLater, it is discovered that \nPreston Greenfield\n, \nAron Santagar\n, and the \nHigh Septon\n lost their lives; Lady \nTanda\n’s\ndaughter \nLollys\n is found alive, having been raped by fifty men outside a tanner’s shop, and Tyrion’s cousin \nTyrek\n is\nmissing.
