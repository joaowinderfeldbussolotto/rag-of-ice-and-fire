Tyrion tells his captor he knows that he is Ser \nJorah Mormont\n and that Jorah has been\nworking for \nVarys\n. Tyrion further explains that he is also on a mission from Varys, thus making them allies, but\nJorah is unmoved by his argument.\nJorah takes a room in the \nMerchant's House\n, chaining Tyrion to the wall for the night. The next day, they hear that\nthe \nGolden Company\n (which Tyrion knows was hired by \nAegon Targaryen\n and \nJon Connington\n) is headed west,\nputting an end to Tyrion's hopes of being rescued by them in Volantis.\nIn the morning they head into the dining hall of the Merchant's House, where Tyrion sees another \ndwarf\n and notices\nthat he has been recognized. He tells Jorah, who is not concerned. Tyrion later reflects that this other dwarf seems\nsomehow familiar. They then talk to the \nwidow of the waterfront\n, a former slave and now the powerful widow of a\ntriarch of Volantis\n, who is sympathetic with \nDaenerys Targaryen\n's actions. Jorah tells her that he needs to book swift\npassage to \nMeereen\n and Daenaerys. She asks Jorah why he seeks Daenerys and he answers, \"To serve her. Defend\nher. Die for her, if need be.\" The widow does not trust his motives, however.\nSuddenly, a chaotic fight breaks out. Tyrion is attacked by the knife-wielding dwarf, but Jorah effortlessly rescues\nhim. Tyrion realizes this dwarf is a girl, and upon questioning her, they learn that the she is \nPenny\n, one of the tilting\ndwarfs from \nJoffrey\n's \nroyal wedding\n. Her brother, also a dwarf, was mistaken for Tyrion and beheaded by sailors,\nbut she was set free when they realized she was a girl.\nThe widow instructs Tyrion to take the \nSelaesori Qhoran\n, a trading \ncog\n which is destined to \nQarth\n by way of \nNew\nGhis\n, but Benerro has foretold that it will not reach this destination. She gives him a message to deliver to Daenerys\nfrom the slaves of Old Volantis: \"Tell her we are waiting. Tell her to come soon.\"\nNavigation:\nTyrion VI\n↑\nThe Wayward Bride\n ←\nTyrion VII\n→ \nJon VI\n↓\nTyrion VIII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 28: Jon VI\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon V\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nJon VI\n→ \nDavos IV\n↓\nJon VII\nSynopsis\nJon\n sends \nAlliser Thorne\n out with \nDywen\n and one other man to range \nbeyond the Wall\n. Thorne believes that Jon is\nsending him out to die, though Dywen mockingly says that they will teach him to be a true ranger. Thorne tells Jon\nthat he will not refuse and give him the pleasure of cutting his head off as he did with \nJanos Slynt\n. Thorne warns Jon\nthat men killed by the Others still remember and he will \ncome back\n if he is killed by one. Jon thinks to himself that\nhe hopes Alliser Thorne does come back, alive, as he is still a brother in the Night's Watch. Jon is also sending out\ntwo other rangings, one led by \nBlack Jack Bulwer\n and another by \nKedge Whiteye\n.\nJon descends the Wall with \nDolorous Edd\n, noting that he is receiving messages of need for more men from some of\nhis commanders as more sightings of wildlings are being reported.
