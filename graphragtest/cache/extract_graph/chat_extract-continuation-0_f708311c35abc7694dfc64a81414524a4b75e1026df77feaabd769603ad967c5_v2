Joffrey is amused by the\nirony of a \ndragon king\n being \nkilled\n with a molten gold crown. He suggests that perhaps he will feed Sansa’s brother\nRobb to wolves and boasts that he intends to challenge Robb to single combat. Sansa states that she would like to\nsee that. Joffrey is suspicious of her meaning, so Sansa distracts him by asking if he will compete today. Joffrey\n\nresponds that his mother claims it would not be fitting for him to compete in his own tourney, otherwise he would be\nchampion. When asked to concur, the Hound says, “Against this lot? Why not?” When Sansa asks the Hound if he\nwill joust, the scarred man replies that it would not be worth the bother, since this is a tourney of gnats. Joffrey\nsuggests he should make the Hound fight the champion to the death, but the Hound replies that Joffrey would only\nbe one knight the poorer (and the Hound is not a knight).\nWhen the trumpets sound, Joffrey takes Sansa’s hand, which repulses her, but she forces herself to be still.\nIn the first joust, Ser \nMeryn Trant\n of the Kingsguard defeats Ser \nHobber Redwyne\n on the second pass. The \nRedwyne\ntwins are hostages like Sansa, and she doubts they entered the tourney voluntarily. Joffrey is disappointed by the\npoor show. Next, Ser \nBalon Swann\n faces the new-made squire \nMorros Slynt\n, who is having difficulty with his lance.\nThe sight of \nJanos Slynt\n’s heir takes Sansa back to the day her father was beheaded; it was Janos Slynt who threw\nher father down and held him while Ser \nIlyn Payne\n swung the sword. Her prayer for Morros to embarrass himself is\nanswered when the former commoner is violently unhorsed. Joffrey hoots in derision, telling Tommen that they\npicked the wrong foe for him, Morros jousts worse than a quintain. Then it is Ser \nHoras Redwyne\n’s turn. He fares\nbetter than his twin, unhorsing an old knight bedecked with silver griffins who makes a poor contest. Disgusted,\nJoffrey declares this a feeble show. He is getting bored and his mood is darkening, which worries Sansa.\nNext, Ser \nDontos Hollard\n is called to face the freerider \nLothor Brune\n. Brune takes his place, but Ser Dontos arrives\ndrunk and half naked, struggling to catch and mount his horse. The audience all laugh at the drunken knight’s antics\nexcept for Joffrey. Eventually, Dontos gives up trying to mount, sits down in the dirt, forfeits the match, and asks for\nmore wine. Joffrey stands and shouts, “A cask from the cellars! I’ll see him drowned in it.”\nWithout thinking, Sansa protests and is immediately shocked that she dared, given Joffrey’s mood. He turns on her,\nfurious at being gainsaid, and Sansa struggles to make up a story that it is a curse to kill a man on one’s name day.\nJoffrey does not believe her, but the Hound comes to her rescue by agree that, “What a man sows on his name day,\nhe reaps throughout the year.” Joffrey reluctantly agree to have the fool killed on the morrow. Sansa seizes the\nopportunity to suggest that Joffrey make Dontos wear motley and clown for him as a fool instead of executing him;\nhe does not deserve the mercy of a quick death. Joffrey likes this idea and agrees. Ser Dontos thanks both Joffrey\nand Sansa.\nOnce Ser Dontos has been led away, the master of revels inquires whether he should summon a new opponent for\nLothor Brune or proceed with the next tilt. Instead, Joffrey calls off the tourney in disgust, saying he would have\nthem all put to death if it weren't his name day. Tommen vehemently protests that he was supposed to ride against\nthe quintain. An argument among the royal siblings ensues. When Myrcella finally points out that their mother\nagreed, Joffrey mocks her for being childish, but Myrcella points out that they ’’are’’ children. The Hound,\nlaughing, tells Joffrey that she has a point. Joffrey sullenly agrees.\nTommen’s opponent is a child-sized quintain wearing a helmet with antlers. Tommen hits it solidly, but it spins\naround to strike Tommen on the back of the head, unhorsing him. This incites a gale of laughter from the crowd,\nmost of all from King Joffrey. Princess Myrcella rushes out to help her brother to his feet. Sansa, with queer\ncourage, suggests that Joffrey should accompany her to help and tell Tommen he rode well. Joffrey angrily refuses,\nstating that getting unhorsed is not riding well. However, Tommen shows courage when he prepares to try again.\nSansa finds herself wishing that Tommen was the eldest child; she wouldn’t mind marrying him.\nJust then, the portcullis rises and the gates of the Red Keep open.
