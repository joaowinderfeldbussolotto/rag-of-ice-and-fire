The soldiers carry a banner of a \nspotted\ntreecat\n, which Yoren cannot identify. They go wide around the camp, since the men might be desperate enough to\ntake their horses or worse. The detour costs them two days at least, but Yoren insists they will spend the rest of their\nlives at \nthe Wall\n, so there is no rush to get there.\n\nOne evening, \nDobber\n spies a fire on the northern horizon. As night falls the fire seems to grow brighter until it looks\nas if the whole north is ablaze. From time to time they can smell the smoke, but the wind holds steady and the\nflames never get any closer. By morning the fire has burned out, but no one has slept very well.\nIt is midday when they come upon the remains of a village. The fields are scorched for miles around and there are\nburnt bodies everywhere. Leaving the rest to guard the wagons, Yoren takes \nMurch\n and \nCutjack\n to investigate the\nruined holdfast. When Arya turns to Gendry he has his helmet on. After a long time, Yoren returns with a \nlittle girl\nand a woman whose right forearm is missing. The girl only cries and the woman only whimpers, \"Please,\" over and\nover again. \nRorge\n thinks this is funny and he and \nBiter\n laugh until Murch curses them and tells them to shut up.\nThey fix the woman a place in a wagon. \nHot Pie\n murmurs that he is scared and Arya admits she is too. Hot Pie\nadmits he never actually kicked a boy to death, he just sold his mother's pies. Arya rides as far ahead of the wagons\nas she dares to get away from the little girl crying and the woman whispering. The one-armed woman dies at\nevenfall, and Gendry and Cutjack bury her on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blows, Arya\nthinks she can hear the tree's branches whispering, \"Please,\" over and over, which frightens her badly.\nThat night, Yoren orders no fire, so supper is sparse and Arya fills her belly with water instead. When she wakes it is\npitch-black and her bladder is full to bursting. As she is leaving to make water, Hot Pie is on guard and insists Yoren\nordered everyone to stay close. When Arya explains her need, Hot Pie tells her to use a nearby tree and explains that\nhe heard wolves earlier. Rather than fight with him, Arya acts afraid and pretends to go back to sleep until Hot Pie\nleaves, then sneaks into the woods on the other side of the camp. Just to make sure, she goes out twice as far as\nusual. As she is doing her business, Arya hears a rustling and sees the eyes shining out from the wood. She grabs for\nNeedle\n and counts the eyes of a whole pack. One wolf comes forward and bares his teeth, but then retreats into the\ndarkness and the wolves leave.\nShe follows the sound of Yoren sharpening his knife back to camp. She climbs into the back of a wagon with him\nand tells him there are wolves in the woods. Yoren is unperturbed, and comments that he thought Arya's \nkind\n were\nfond of wolves. Arya tells him about her \ndirewolf\n \nNymeria\n and how she was forced to drive her off. Yoren\ncomments that the only wolves they have to fear are the human kind, like the ones who burned that village. He\nwonders aloud if he should have left them all back in the city where it seems safer. Arya insists that she wants to go\nhome. Yoren replies that he has been bringing men to the Wall for nearly thirty years and only lost three, but this\ntime he should have taken a ship.\nYoren tells Arya to get some sleep, and she tries, but she can hear the wolves howling, and fainter than that she\nhears what might be screams.\nNavigation:\nArya II\n↑\nTyrion II\n ←\nArya III\n→ \nDavos I\n↓\nArya IV\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 10: Davos I\nPlace(s): \nDragonstone\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya III\n ←\nDavos I\n→ \nTheon I\n↓\nDavos II\nDavos Seaworth\n watches the burning of the \nSeven\n.
