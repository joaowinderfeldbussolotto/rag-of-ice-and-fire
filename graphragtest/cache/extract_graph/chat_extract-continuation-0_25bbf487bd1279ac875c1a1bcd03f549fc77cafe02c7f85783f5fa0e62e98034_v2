Ser Brynden agrees and Catelyn and Ser\nRodrik enter Lysa’s apartment.\nLysa’s apartments overlook a grassy area scattered with statues (the remnants of a failed attempt to plant a\ngodswood\n) where the duel will take place. An elegant looking Lysa is holding court on the terrace, surrounded by\nher many suitors. The young Lord \nRobert\n is in a chair on an elevated platform being entertained by a puppeteer.\nCatelyn attempts to explain to Lysa that they have nothing to gain by executing \nTyrion Lannister\n and everything to\nlose if his champion should succeed. Lysa and her suitors insist that any knight is superior to a common \nsellsword\nlike Bronn. Having seen \nBronn\n fight on the high road, Catelyn is much less certain. Trying another approach,\nCatelyn argues that the Lannisters (especially \nJaime Lannister\n) will not be satisfied that they had a trial before\nexecuting Tyrion. \nLyn Corbray\n insists that Tyrion’s head will serve as a warning to the Lannisters, but Lysa insists\n\nthat her son wants to see Tyrion fly as if it settles the matter. Catelyn attempts one final time to stop the trial by\nclaiming Tyrion is \nher\n prisoner. Lysa merely rants that Tyrion killed her husband and she means to see him pay.\nSer Rodrik asks Catelyn quietly if she truly thinks Tyrion did it. She states that she believes the Lannisters murdered\nJon Arryn\n, but she cannot say whether it was \nCersei\n, Jaime, or Tyrion; Lysa named Cersei in her letter, but now she\nseems certain it was Tyrion, perhaps because she has Tyrion as her captive. Ser Rodrik agrees that poison could be\nthe work of Tyrion or Cersei, but Jaime is too fond of blood to have used poison. Catelyn wonders how else they\ncould have made it look a natural death.\nWhen Catelyn hears her nephew shriek in delight at the antics of the puppets, she states that the boy is too\nundisciplined; he will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from Lysa. \nMaester\n \nColemon\n, having\noverheard this, pipes in that Jon Arryn agreed and was planning to send the boy to \nDragonstone\n. Catelyn corrects\nhim that it was \nCasterly Rock\n, but the maester insists it was Dragonstone.\nTyrion Lannister is led forward and Robert asks if he can make him fly. Then the two champions appear from either\nside of the garden. Ser \nVardis Egen\n is armored in plate from head to toe with a narrow slit for vision. Bronn looks\nalmost naked by comparison, wearing only a half helm, a mail coif, and ringmail over boiled leather. However,\nCatelyn notices that Bronn is 15 years younger and half a hand taller, with a greater reach than Ser Vardis,\nThe \nsepton\n calls upon the gods before making a hasty departure. Robert is impatient for the fight to start. The\nknight’s heavy kite shield is strapped to his arm by a squire. When offered a shield, Bronn refuses. The knight is\nhanded an elegant double-edged sword that Lysa announces belonged to Jon Arryn for ceremonial occasions. Lysa\nexplains that she thinks it is only fitting that Ser Vardis avenge Lord Arryn with his own blade, but Catelyn notices\nthat Ser Vardis shows some discomfort with the strange sword. Finally, Robert is allowed to initiate the fight. After\nan initial probing exchange, Bronn starts to leap away from the knight’s advances. The crowd starts declaring that\nBronn is craven, but Ser Rodrik tells Catelyn that Bronn is trying to tire the knight.\nAs she watches the fight, Catelyn remembers the duel between \nBrandon Stark\n and \nPetyr Baelish\n. When Brandon\nsaw the limited armor Petyr was wearing, he took off most of his own armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor, but\nher father had promised her to Brandon. As she had given the favor to Brandon, Catelyn had begged him to not kill\nPetyr and he had agreed. The fight was ended quickly with a deep cut to Petyr’s ribs, which Catelyn was sure was\nfatal. That was the last time she had seen Petyr \nuntil King’s Landing\n.\nWhen Catelyn returns her attention to the fight she can tell Bronn is quicker. Robert complains that the combatants\nare not fighting properly, but his mother assures him that the \nsellsword\n cannot run all day. Eventually Ser Vardis is\naddled by a fall, and loses sight of Bronn because of his narrow visor. Bronn uses this opportunity to place a serious\nblow to the knight’s elbow. Now the knight’s parries begin to grow slower and lower and Bronn attacks with more\nenergy. Blind to the fact that Ser Vardis is losing, Lysa calls for him to finish the sellsword as if he were delaying\nthe end on purpose. The knight charges and Bronn almost loses his balance but manages to jump back from the blow\nand push a statue onto the knight. With Ser Vardis pinned under the fallen\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>Winterfell is the ancestral home of House Stark, where Catelyn and Ser Rodrik are returning to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSA<|>PERSON<|>Lysa is the sister of Catelyn and the ruler of the Vale, holding court and overseeing the duel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER BRYNDEN<|>PERSON<|>Ser Brynden is Catelyn's uncle who agrees to return to Winterfell with her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER RODRIK<|>PERSON<|>Ser Rodrik is a companion of Catelyn who accompanies her to Lysa’s apartment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>Robert is Lysa’s young son who is entertained by a puppeteer during the duel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion Lannister is a Lannister accused of murder and facing a trial by combat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRONN<|>PERSON<|>Bronn is a sellsword chosen as Tyrion’s champion in the duel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYN CORBRAY<|>PERSON<|>Lyn Corbray is one of Lysa’s suitors who insists on executing Tyrion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAIME LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>Jaime Lannister is Tyrion’s brother and a suspected conspirator in Jon Arryn’s murder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERSEI<|>PERSON<|>Cersei is Jaime’s sister and another suspected conspirator in Jon Arryn’s murder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>PERSON<|>Jon Arryn is Lysa’s late husband, whose murder is a central issue in the conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER COLEMON<|>PERSON<|>Maester Colemon is a scholar who discusses Jon Arryn’s plans for Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER VARDIS EGEN<|>PERSON<|>Ser Vardis Egen is the knight chosen as Lysa’s champion in the duel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTON<|>PERSON<|>The septon is a religious figure who calls upon the gods before the duel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDON STARK<|>PERSON<|>Brandon Stark is Catelyn’s late betrothed who dueled Petyr Baelish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETYR BAELISH<|>PERSON<|>Petyr Baelish is a former rival of Brandon Stark who was injured in a duel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING’S LANDING<|>GEO<|>King’s Landing is the capital city where Catelyn last saw Petyr Baelish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRAGONSTONE<|>GEO<|>Dragonstone is a castle where Jon Arryn planned to send Robert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTERLY ROCK<|>GEO<|>Casterly Rock is the ancestral home of House Lannister, mentioned as an alternative to Dragonstone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE DUEL<|>EVENT<|>The duel is a trial by combat between Bronn and Ser Vardis Egen to determine Tyrion’s fate)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSA<|>ROBERT<|>Lysa is the mother of Robert, who is entertained during the duel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSA<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>Lysa accuses Tyrion of murdering her husband and demands his execution<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>BRONN<|>Bronn is Tyrion’s champion in the duel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSA<|>SER VARDIS EGEN<|>Ser Vardis Egen is Lysa’s chosen champion in the duel<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRONN<|>SER VARDIS EGEN<|>Bronn defeats Ser Vardis Egen in the duel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSA<|>JON ARRYN<|>Lysa was married to Jon Arryn, whose murder she seeks to avenge<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATELYN<|>BRANDON STARK<|>Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark before his death<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATELYN<|>PETYR BAELISH<|>Catelyn witnessed Petyr Baelish’s duel with Brandon Stark<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRANDON STARK<|>PETYR BAELISH<|>Brandon Stark dueled and injured Petyr Baelish<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATELYN<|>SER RODRIK<|>Ser Rodrik accompanies Catelyn and discusses the murder of Jon Arryn with her<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATELYN<|>LYSA<|>Catelyn is Lysa’s sister and attempts to reason with her about Tyrion’s trial<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSA<|>MAESTER COLEMON<|>Maester Colemon serves Lysa and discusses Robert’s future<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>DRAGONSTONE<|>Jon Arryn planned to send Robert to Dragonstone<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATELYN<|>CASTERLY ROCK<|>Catelyn mentions Casterly Rock as an alternative to Dragonstone<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATELYN<|>KING’S LANDING<|>Catelyn last saw Petyr Baelish in King’s Landing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DUEL<|>TYRION LANNISTER<|>The duel determines Tyrion’s fate<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DUEL<|>BRONN<|>Bronn participates in the duel as Tyrion’s champion<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DUEL<|>SER VARDIS EGEN<|>Ser Vardis Egen participates in the duel as Lysa’s champion<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
