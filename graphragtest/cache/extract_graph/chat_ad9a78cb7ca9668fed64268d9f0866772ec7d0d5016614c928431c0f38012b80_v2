He wonders where he is to find yet more men. He\nsees \nIron Emmett\n in the yard and asks to spar with three of his best men, telling them all to come at him at the same\ntime. \nRattleshirt\n sees them and tells Jon that he should fight a man and not boys and they begin to spar. Rattleshirt is\ngetting the best of him, despite fighting with a larger greatsword and no shield. Eventually they lose their swords,\nroll, and the fight ends with Rattleshirt on top. He is dragged off and Jon remarks that Rattleshirt fought well.\nA raven arrives with a message that Jon's half-sister \nArya\n is to marry \nRamsay Bolton\n. The others ask how old his\nsister is, and he replies that she is eleven and that he has no sisters, only brothers in the Night's Watch. Jon later\nremembers his sister and the sword \nNeedle\n he once gave to her, wondering if she still has it.\nHe goes for a walk and sees \nMelisandre\n, though at first he believes her to be \nYgritte\n. Melisandre tells him that he\nshould not worry over matters of the heart and that she sees that his sister will flee this marriage and ride towards\nthem on a dying horse. She also foresees that three of the rangers sent out will die, and come back eyeless. As she is\nleaving she tells him that when the dead men return, he should take her hand and she will save his sister.\nNavigation:\nJon V\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nJon VI\n→ \nDavos IV\n↓\nJon VII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 29: Davos IV\nPlace(s): \nWhite Harbor\n \n \nNavigation:\nDavos III\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nDavos IV\n→ \nDaenerys V\nSynopsis\nDavos\n, still imprisoned in the \nWolf's Den\n, is awaiting his death and hopes that he will at least die honorably, losing\nhis head first and not his hands. He passes his time chatting to the guards, gaining a few favours in the form of\ncandles, books, paper & a quill, as well as learning a little more about the general history of the north. Davos writes\na few letters to his sons to be delivered upon his death. It is then that \nRobett Glover\n appears at his door and politely\nasks him to follow; Davos is wary but notes his mannerisms and follows.\nHe is led through secret hallways always going in different directions, passing the old godswood on the way.\nEventually they end up in a room of the \nNew Castle\n where Lord \nWyman Manderly\n is waiting for him. He declines\nthe offers of food and wine; Lord Wyman though, apologizes for his poor treatment of Davos. Wyman tells him that\nthey must talk fast, as the \nFreys\n wait above, and Davos can hear the sounds of music and chatter above. Lord\nWyman says that they must act quickly for Davos is \"dead\" and his head sits upon the Seal Gate. A criminal similar\nin appearance to Davos was executed in his place, his head and hands (with fingers carefully shortened) mounted on\nthe wall. He then learns that Lord Wyman Manderly only plays along with the Freys because he has to, as his son\nWylis Manderly\n is being held hostage, though he drinks for his safe return.\nDavos says he was quite convinced by Wyman's daughters' behaviour, though he was confused by \nWylla Manderly\n.\nWyman responds that his young granddaughter was extremely brave to have said those things. There was truth in\nher words as the debt the \nManderlys\n owe the \nStarks\n and \nWinterfell\n can never be repaid. He adds though that he\ncannot show any sign of contempt to \nKing's Landing\n for fear of the harm they might do to his son. \nTywin Lannister\ntold Wyman that he must confess his treason, yield White Harbor, declare his loyalty to \nKing Tommen\n, and bend his\nknee to \nRoose Bolton\n. If he refused, Wylis would be killed as a traitor, White Harbor would be sacked and his\npeople would \"suffer the same fates as the \nReynes\n of Castamere\". If he complies, his son will be released. By\n\"killing\" Davos, he has proved his loyalty to the Iron Throne and assured the release of Wylis, which Davos notes is\na brave move.\nWyman adds that he has been unable to send Stannis more information in his letters because the Freys infest his\ncourt, looking for any sign of treachery and his \nmaester\n \nTheomore\n is \na distant cousin to the Lannisters\n, so Manderly\ndoes not trust him. Manderly goes on to add his rage at his son \nWendel Manderly\n's death at the hands of the Freys,\ncalling it murder and the Freys' claims fables. He tells Davos that the \nNorth\n remembers and his son is home,\nmeaning that his act for the Freys is almost over as well.\nHe then summons \nTheon\n's mute squire\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ad9a78cb7ca9668fed64268d9f0866772ec7d0d5016614c928431c0f38012b80_v2"}
