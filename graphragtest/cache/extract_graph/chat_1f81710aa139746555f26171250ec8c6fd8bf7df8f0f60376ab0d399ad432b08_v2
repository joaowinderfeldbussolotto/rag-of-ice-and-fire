The lady from \nMyr\n is telling Cersei\nabout all the men who are always around \nMargaery\n, and how she was present for the bedding at \nRenly\n's wedding.\nAlthough Taena is not sure if Margaery is still a maiden, she affirms that Renly was aroused. She also lets on that\nbesides all the \nknights\n and bards, \nPycelle\n is a frequent visitor of the young queen, and her brother \nLoras\n visits\nperhaps more than any other. They also discuss the new \nHigh Septon\n, a man who was once a \"\nsparrow\n\" and not a\nmember of the \nMost Devout\n. This is not only surprising, but also of concern to Cersei, and she considers that she\nmay have to poison this new leader of the Seven, if he becomes unruly.\nReaching the top of \nVisenya's Hill\n, the queen's litter can continue no further as the streets are packed with\n\"sparrows\". Continuing on foot, Cersei considers Pycelle's objection to her choice of \nOsfryd Kettleblack\n to replace\nAddam Marbrand\n as the commander of the City Watch. She takes note of all the bones and skulls piled up around\nthe statue of Baelor, and is told that they are the remains of septons and septas who were killed by the war, because\nthey received no protection from the Throne. At the doors to the Great Sept, armed men block the \nKingsguards\n'\nentry since they bear weapons. Cersei must enter alone, and as she does she wonders about these anointed knights\nanswering the call to defend \nthe Faith\n.\nInside the Sept, she is appalled to find Septon \nRaynard\n in roughspun robes scrubbing the floors, and learns that\nSepton \nTorbert\n has been imprisoned for being obese when so many are starving. She berates the new High Septon,\nthis \"sparrow\" wearing frayed robes and standing before her barefoot. He tells her that the Faith has sold the crown\nher father gave his predecessor, as well as all the valuables in their vaults, in order to help feed the poor. Cersei\nrecalls \nQyburn\n's report that the \"sparrows\" broke down the doors of the Sept before the final vote with axes in their\nhands and their leader on their shoulders. She now understands how this man was elected High Septon. Speaking in\nprivate, the priest reprimands her for beheading \nNed Stark\n on the steps of the Great Sept, and reveals that he hasn't\ncome to the \nRed Keep\n to bless King \nTommen\n because he is still praying for guidance from \nthe Seven\n to affirm that\nthe boy is the rightful king. The Queen Regent begins to seethe with anger, but concedes to his concerns that the\nholy men and women on the roads need protection from rape and murder: Cersei agrees to have Tommen rearm the\nFaith, something King \nMaegor\n forbade almost 300 years ago. She promises to restore the \nFaith Militant\n, for which\nthe High Septon will acknowledge Tommen as king and forgive the Crown's debt to the Faith.\nBack in her litter, Cersei tells Taena of her triumph: with one stroke she has gotten the Faith to bless Tommen,\nreduced the Throne's debt by almost a million dragons, and cleared the city of \"sparrows\" by restoring the \nWarrior's\nSons\n and the \nPoor Fellows\n. Yet she doesn't realize the repercussions of what she has set in motion. On the way back\nto the Red Keep, Cersei's litter encounters Margaery's entourage returning from a horse ride and picnic. Margaery\ntells Cersei that she should share some of the burden of ruling the realm. But Cersei laughs at her, especially when\nthe young queen tells her she is always well protected by her brother Loras when she goes riding.\nNavigation:\nCersei V\n↑\n\nJaime III\n ←\nCersei VI\n→ \nThe Reaver\n↓\nCersei VII\n\nA Feast for C\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1f81710aa139746555f26171250ec8c6fd8bf7df8f0f60376ab0d399ad432b08_v2"}
