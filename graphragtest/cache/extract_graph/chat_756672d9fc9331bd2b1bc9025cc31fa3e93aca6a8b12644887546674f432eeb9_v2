Cersei adds that it was close even so; all\nmight have been lost if Sansa had not come to Cersei with her father’s plans. Tyrion expresses surprise that Sansa\nwould betray her own father's plans, but Cersei explains that the girl was in love with Joffrey and would have done\nanything for him right up until he cut her father's head off and called it \"mercy\".\nTyrion also learns it was Varys who suggested Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n be removed as \nLord Commander of the\nKingsguard\n when Joffrey wanted to blame someone for \nRobert\n’s death. It freed the Lord Commander's post and\ncouncil seat for Jaime, and allowed Joffrey to throw a bone to \nthe Hound\n. A generous severance was provided, but\nSelmy would have none of it and fled the city. Tyrion notes that he heard Selmy slew the two gold cloaks sent to\napprehend him, which Cersei blames on Slynt’s incompetence. Tyrion points out that Barristan the Bold is a living\nlegend who lends credibility to any man he serves. Cersei admits she did not think of that. Tyrion points out that\ntheir father did, and that is why he sent Tyrion to bring Joffrey to heel.\nCersei argues that Joffrey will be no more tractable for Tyrion, but Tyrion points out that Joffrey might be more\ninclined to listen if he feels threatened, something he doesn’t feel with her. Cersei insists that she will never let\nTyrion harm her son, but Tyrion assures her that he only means to threaten. Cersei admits it is worth a try, but\nremains adamant that Tyrion do nothing without her consent. Tyrion agrees, then asks for an honest answer to who\nkilled \nJon Arryn\n. Cersei tells him she does not know, and goes on to say that Eddard Stark asked her the same\nquestion and hinted that Jon Arryn suspected her of something she hesitates to mention. Tyrion earns a slap in the\nface when he reveals that he knew about her incest with Jaime all along. Tyrion insist that he is not as blind as their\nfather and makes several rude comments that earn him more slaps until he finally warns her that he is getting angry.\nTyrion asks how King \nRobert\n was killed, and Cersei explains that \nLancel Lannister\n gave him strongwine of three\ntimes the normal potency before he faced the boar, which Cersei claims tasted like triumph when it was served at\nRobert’s funeral feast. Tyrion, who rather liked King Robert, comments that Cersei was born to be a widow as he\nrises to leave. Cersei objects that she has not excused him and presses for details about how he will free Jaime.\nTyrion tells her he does not know yet, but reminds her to make sure no harm comes to Sansa.\nOutside, Timett has disappeared to explore the city, so Tyrion commands Bronn to find him and make arrangements\nfor the \nclansmen\n in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion commands \nVylarr\n, the captain of Cersei’s\nhousehold guard, to provide an escort for him to the \nBroken Anvil Inn\n, hoping to remind the captain that his oath is\nto \nCasterly Rock\n and not to Cersei alone. As he leaves the \nRed Keep\n, Tyrion orders the spiked heads of Eddard\nStark and his household taken down and given to the \nsilent sisters\n. When Vylarr hesitates because King Joffrey\nordered them to remain, Tyrion warns him that if they are not removed one of the spikes will have his head.\nAs they ride through the city, Tyrion notices the effect \nthe war\n is having on the common people. The markets are\nfull of ragged men selling their household goods, but bare of farmers selling food. There are guards at every shop,\nand Tyrion notes that in lean times even bakers find sellswords cheaper than bread. Vylarr confirms that very little\nfood is coming into the city with the roads closed to south and west. Tyrion asks what Cersei has done, and is told\nshe has tripled the City Watch and has thousands of craftsmen working on the defenses, including the \nAlchemists'\nGuild\n which has pledged ten thousand jars of \nwildfire\n. The thought of so much wildfire makes Tyrion\n\nuncomfortable, and he asks where the money is coming from, given that Robert beggared the realm. Vylarr explains\nthat Littlefinger has introduced a tax on entering the city. Tyrion considers this clever and cruel, since tens of\nthousands are fleeing the war for the supposed safety of the capital. When they arrive at the inn, he dismisses Vylarr\nand says he plans to stay the night.\nInside, Tyrion finds \nShae\n sitting with several \nBlack Ears\n and Varys. Tyrion is irritated that Varys found Shae so\nquickly and wonders who might have betrayed him. Varys says that he had a sudden urge to meet Tyrion’s young\nlady and Tyrion realizes that the eunuch is indirectly threatening him. The two exchange some veiled threats before\nVarys asks if Tyrion has seen the red comet. Tyrion replies that he is short, not blind; on the \nkingsroad\n it seemed to\ncover half the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_756672d9fc9331bd2b1bc9025cc31fa3e93aca6a8b12644887546674f432eeb9_v2"}
