Then\nCersei shows Sansa the letter her father wrote to Stannis, which has been taken off \nthe captain of his guard\n. Sansa\ninsists that it cannot be true because her father was the king’s friend.\nCersei informs Sansa that she cannot allow the daughter of a traitor to marry her son. Sansa is overwhelmed by the\nunfairness of taking away her beloved because of something her father did. Cersei states that she knew Sansa was\ninnocent from the moment Sansa came to her with Lord Eddard’s plan to take her away. Sansa insists that she did\nthis because she loves Joffrey, remembering that she felt very wicked sneaking away to the queen. She had wanted\n\nto go to the king, but loud and often drunk King Robert had always frightened her. She had also believed the king\nwould probably have just sent her back to her father. After having informed the queen of her father’s plans, Sansa\nwas locked in the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast, under guard. A few hours later the fighting had started.\nThe small council discusses whether Sansa could also turn out to be traitorous. \nVarys\n and \nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\nopine that the child of a traitor is also likely to become traitorous. Littlefinger points out that Sansa reminds him of\nher mother\n rather than her father. Queen Cersei expresses doubt that Sansa can be trusted since \nher sister\n turned her\nwolf on Joffrey. Sansa replies that she is nothing like her traitorous sister; she only wants to be Joffrey’s wife.\nQueen Cersei then suggests that if the rest of Sansa's kin prove loyal it would rest some of the council’s fears.\nTherefore, Cersei asks that Sansa write to her lady mother and her brother \nRobb\n explaining how Lord Eddard\nbetrayed his king. Sansa does not know what to say, but Cersei assures her that they will provide her with the words.\nThe important thing is that the \nStarks\n keep the King’s Peace; otherwise it will go hard on them and on Sansa. Sansa\nis also told write that she is being well cared for and that her family must come to \nKing's Landing\n and pledge fealty\nto Joffrey.\nSansa asks to see her father, but is told that if she is truly loyal she should not want to see him. Sansa says she is\nconcerned about him and what will happen to him. She is told that her father is well and that the king will decide his\npunishment. Sansa realizes that the king is now her gallant Joffrey, whom she knows would never hurt her father\nand who is sure to listen to her pleas. Perhaps her father will only be exiled for a few years. However, if her mother\nor Robb did something treasonous it will all go wrong.\nSansa agrees to write the letters and ends up writing four: to her mother, her brother Robb, her \nAunt Lysa\n, and her\ngrandfather \nHoster Tully\n. When she returns to her room, Jeyne and her belongings are already gone. It is only when\nshe is drifting off to sleep that night that Sansa realizes she has forgotten to ask about Arya.\nNavigation:\nSansa IIV\n↑\nArya IV\n ←\nSansa IV\n→ \nJon VII\n↓\nSansa V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 52: Jon VII\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon VI\n↑\nSansa IV\n ←\nJon VII\n→ \nBran VI\n↓\nJon VIII\nThe bodies of two men that accompanied \nBenjen Stark\n are found. Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n blames \nwildlings\n, but \nSam\npoints out odd characteristics about the bodies. Back at \nCastle Black\n, \nJon\n learns that King \nRobert\n is dead and that \nhis\nfather\n is charged with treason. At dinner that night, Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n mocks Jon and his father, and Jon attacks\nhim. That night Jon finds the \nwight\n of one of the dead men in the \nLord Commander’s\n room. Jon kills the monster,\nsaving the Lord Commander.\nSynopsis\nWith the hounds being useless, \nGhost\n has led the party to the bodies of two rangers. The area makes both the hounds\nand the horses nervous and even \nJon\n feels uncomfortable. Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n identifies the bodies as \nOthor\n and\nJafer Flowers\n, two of \nBenjen Stark\n’s men. It was Jafer’s right hand that Ghost brought to Jon in the \nweirwood\n grove.\nThe corpse’s remaining hand is as black as the cloak he wears. Both of the corpses have the same pale skin, black\nhands, and staring blue eyes.\nRemarking that they are only two of the six men that Benjen took with him, \nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n asks Ser\nJaremy how two men could die so close to \nthe Wall\n without the rangers knowing; Othor even wears a hunting horn.\nSer Jaremy insists that no horn was blown or it would have been heard. He goes on to complain that he does not\nhave sufficient men to patrol and mentions the Lord Commander’s own order to stay close to the Wall following\nBenjen’s disappearance.\nMormont asks how the men died. A quick examination shows that Jafer was killed by an axe blow to the neck and\nthat Othor\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STANNIS
