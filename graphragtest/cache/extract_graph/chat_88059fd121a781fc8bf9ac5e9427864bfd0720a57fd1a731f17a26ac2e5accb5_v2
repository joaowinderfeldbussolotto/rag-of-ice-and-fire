Joffrey insists that the king\ncan do as he likes, and Tyrion asks if he knows what happened to \nAerys II Targaryen\n, who also did what he liked.\n\nSer Boros warns Tyrion that no one is to threaten the king, but Tyrion responds he is only educating him, and then\ntells Bronn and Timett to kill Ser Boros if he opens his mouth again.\nWhen Ser Boros, turning red, states the queen will hear of this, Tyrion asks if they should send for Cersei. When\nJoffrey has nothing to say, Tyrion tells him to learn to use his ears more and his mouth less, lest his reign be shorter\nthan Tyrion himself. He points out that brutality will not win his people’s love, nor his queen’s. Joffrey replies that\nCersei taught him to value fear over love, and Sansa fears him. Tyrion only notes that it is a pity \nStannis\n and \nRenly\nare not twelve year-old girls as well.\nTyrion then continues by ordering Bronn and Timett to bring Sansa. They take her to the \nTower of the Hand\n. She is\nshaking and moving as if she were in a dream. Serving girls clean her up and Maester \nFrenken\n treats her wounds.\nSansa thinks how the Hound hated knights, and now she hates them also, and she does not believe they are true\nknights. She sleeps.\nShe wakes that night and her legs pain her when she gets up. Outside her door, she finds \na woman\n whom she tells\nshe wants to go to the \ngodswood\n; she wants to find Ser Dontos and beg him to take her home before it is too late.\nThe woman tells her that Tyrion said she was not to leave. When food comes in the morning she tells the servant to\ntake it away. Later, Tyrion arrives and tells her that she is a guest, not a prisoner.\nTyrion then tells the story of Robb’s victory. Ser Stafford’s host was encamped outside \nOxcross\n. He explains that\nthere were no army of wargs or sorcery involved as Ser Lancel claimed, as Lancel wouldn’t know a warg from a\nwart and according to Tyrion, \n\"sorcery is the sauce men spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own\nincompetence\"\n. Robb’s soldiers crept into the camp and cut the horse lines, and then Robb sent his \ndirewolf\n among\nthem, causing a stampede. The panicked horses trampled the camp, killing many. Most of the rest fled in terror,\ncasting aside their weapons. Among the dead are Ser Stafford (killed by Lord \nRickard Karstark\n), Ser \nRupert Brax\n,\nSer \nLymond Vikary\n, Lord \nCrakehall\n, and Lord \nAntario Jast\n. Fifty have been taken prisoner including Jast’s sons and\nMartyn Lannister\n. The incompetent Ser Stafford had not even bothered to post sentries, thinking himself safe and\nsecure in the Westerlands and most of his army were raw recruits, the sweepings of \nLannisport\n. The only mystery is\nhow Robb reached Oxcross since \nLannister\n forces hold the \nGolden Tooth\n and the men stationed there swear Robb\ndidn't pass them. Tyrion ultimately declares it unimportant; Robb Stark is \nhis father\n's problem, while Joffrey is his.\nTyrion then asks Sansa how she feels about his nephew and she responds that she loves him with all her heart, more\nthan ever. Tyrion is amused and tells her someone taught her to lie well, which she may be grateful for one day. He\nthen asks if she has flowered, to which she answers no. He says that is good, and that he does not intend for her to\nmarry Joffrey, since there will never be a reconciliation between the Lannisters and \nStarks\n with the way Joffrey has\nacted, calling it a pity as the marriage was one of \nRobert I Baratheon\n’s better notions. Sansa is concerned that this is\na trick and states she only wants to be loyal. Tyrion adds \"...and far from any Lannisters\", but admits he cannot\nblame her, as when he was her age, he wanted the same thing.\nHe then notes that she visits the godswood every day and asks what she prays for. Sansa prays for Robb’s victory\nand Joffrey’s death, but claims she prays for an end to the fighting. Tyrion tells her there will be another battle\nbetween Robb and \nTywin Lannister\n and that will settle the issue, warning her not to think that Oxcross was\nsignificant, and to pray that her brother bends his knee, and he will return her to \nWinterfell\n once there is peace. He\noffers to have some of his \nclansmen\n guard her, maybe \nChella\n if she prefers a woman. Sansa, thinking about Ser\nDontos rescuing her, tells him that the wildlings frighten her. He responds that they also frighten Joffrey and the\nlickspittles and sycophants who make up his Kingsguard so no one would harm her. When she tells him she would\nprefer sleeping in her own bed and the tower is where her father’s men were slain, and their ghosts give her bad\ndream\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_88059fd121a781fc8bf9ac5e9427864bfd0720a57fd1a731f17a26ac2e5accb5_v2"}
