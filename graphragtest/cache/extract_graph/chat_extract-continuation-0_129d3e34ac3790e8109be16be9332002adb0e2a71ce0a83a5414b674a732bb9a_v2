Bronn\nthen informs Tyrion that his is no man’s toady. Tyrion replies that he is sure Bronn is no man’s friend, adding that\nhe is sure Bronn will betray him just like Lady Stark if there is a profit. However, Tyrion begs Bronn to remember\nthat he will match any price offered to betray him because he likes living. Bronn disappears to go hunting at\nTyrion’s request.\nAn hour later they are eating a goat they have roasted. Tyrion complains about the meat’s toughness, but says he\nwill not complain too loudly since at the \nEyrie\n he would have to dance on a precipice for a boiled bean. Bronn then\ncomplains that Tyrion gave the \nturnkey\n a purse of gold and Tyrion states that a Lannister always pays his debts. He\nkept his silver, however. After giving the turnkey the purse, Tyrion told him that if he ever tired of Lady Arryn’s\n\nservice, he need only come to \nCasterly Rock\n to get the rest. Bronn asks what Tyrion plans when they reach the river\nand Tyrion states a whore, a feather bed, and wine for a start and then on to Casterly Rock or King’s Landing since\nhe has questions about a dagger. Bronn seems surprised that Tyrion is truly innocent.\nAs they settle down for the night, Tyrion notes that the clansmen are taking their time. Bronn replies that he would\nfear a trap with them being so open. Tyrion suggests they sing to scare them away. As Tyrion whistles a song, he\nasks Bronn if he has ever heard it before. Bronn states he has heard it in inns and whorehouses. Tyrion goes on to\nsay the \nfirst girl\n he bedded used to sing it. He tells Bronn the story of when he and his brother \nJaime\n rescued her.\nThey heard a scream and Tysha came running onto the road chased by two men. Jaime went after the men while\nTyrion dismounted to protect the girl. He tells Bronn that she was about a year older than him, low born, half-\nstarved, and unwashed. When Jaime left to get help from \nCasterly Rock\n, Tyrion took her to an inn where they shared\na meal and talked. The wine went to 13-year old Tyrion’s head and he found himself in bed with her. When he broke\nher maidenhead she wept and then kissed him. He found a drunken \nsepton\n to marry them and set her up a cottage of\nher own where they played man and wife for a fortnight. Then the septon sobered and told \nTyrion’s father\n, and that\nwas the end of his marriage. Jaime was forced to confess that the girl was a whore and that he set the whole thing\nup. Then Lord Tywin gave her to a barracks of guardsmen and paid her a silver for each one. Tywin made Tyrion go\nlast, having him pay her a gold coin since he was a Lannister.\nBronn states that he would have killed the man who did that to him and Tyrion states that he might yet; a Lannister\nalways pays his debts. Tyrion rolls into his \nshadowskin\n cloak to sleep, and dreams of the \nsky cells\n but this time he is\nthe jailor, driving his father back to the abyss.\nBronn wakes him with a warning and Tyrion motions for Bronn to stay still. Then Tyrion calls out for the clansmen\nto join them and share their goat. A voice replies that, since this is their mountain, it is their goat. Tyrion agrees that\nit is and asks their names. They declare themselves \nStone Crows\n and a big man named \nShagga\n armed with two axes\nsteps into the light first. Slowly the rest emerge, armed with a variety of weapons including pitchforks.\nTyrion introduces himself and declares himself a member of “Clan Lannister.” He offers to pay the clansmen for the\ngoat they ate. \nGunthor son of Gurn\n, who seems to be their chief, asks what he has to give them, and Tyrion tells\nthem he has silver in his purse, and his weapons and armor. \nConn\n replies that Tyrion is going to pay them with their\nown coin; they can take what they want from their corpses. Gunthor states they have nothing to give but their lives\nand asks Tyrion how he would like to die. Tyrion replies, “In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden’s\nmouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.” Shagga laughs but the others seem unamused.\nGunthor tells Conn to kill Bronn and take Tyrion to milk goats and make the mothers laugh. Bronn springs to his\nfeet, asking who dies first, but Tyrion screams for him to stop. Tyrion asks the clansmen if their weapons are the\nbest they could steal, declaring them good for killing sheep at most. He adds that his father’s smiths shit better\nweapons. Gunthor, thinking of the starving women and children of his tribe, is interested and asks what Tyrion will\ngive them for their lives. In addition to the list of weapons suggested by the tribesmen, Tyrion offers them the \nVale\nof Arryn\n.\nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nJon V\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nEddard XI\n↓\nTyrion VII\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYRION<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion is a member of the Lannister family, known for his wit and cunning, and is often involved in political and personal conflicts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRONN<|>PERSON<|>Bronn is a sellsword and companion to Tyrion, known for his pragmatism and loyalty for profit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY STARK<|>PERSON<|>Lady Stark is referenced as someone who might betray Tyrion, though not directly present in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTERLY ROCK<|>GEO<|>Casterly Rock is the ancestral home of House Lannister, where Tyrion plans to go)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>King's Landing is the capital city where Tyrion has questions about a dagger)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EYRIE<|>GEO<|>The Eyrie is a fortress where Tyrion was previously held, known for its precarious location)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYSHA<|>PERSON<|>Tysha was a woman Tyrion married as a young man, later revealed to be a whore set up by his brother Jaime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAIME<|>PERSON<|>Jaime is Tyrion's brother, who played a role in the deception involving Tysha)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORD TYWIN<|>PERSON<|>Lord Tywin is Tyrion's father, who orchestrated the humiliation of Tyrion regarding Tysha)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STONE CROWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Stone Crows are a clan of mountain tribesmen encountered by Tyrion and Bronn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAGGA<|>PERSON<|>Shagga is a member of the Stone Crows, known for his size and armed with two axes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUNTHOR SON OF GURN<|>PERSON<|>Gunthor is the chief of the Stone Crows, who negotiates with Tyrion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONN<|>PERSON<|>Conn is a member of the Stone Crows, involved in the confrontation with Tyrion and Bronn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALE OF ARRYN<|>GEO<|>The Vale of Arryn is a region offered by Tyrion to the Stone Crows in exchange for their lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTON<|>PERSON<|>A drunken septon who married Tyrion and Tysha, later revealing the truth to Lord Tywin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY<|>PERSON<|>A turnkey is a jailer whom Tyrion bribed with a purse of gold)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>BRONN<|>Bronn is Tyrion's companion and sellsword, loyal to him for profit<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>LADY STARK<|>Tyrion compares Bronn's potential betrayal to Lady Stark's actions<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>CASTERLY ROCK<|>Tyrion plans to return to Casterly Rock, his family's ancestral home<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>KING'S LANDING<|>Tyrion has questions about a dagger and plans to go to King's Landing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>EYRIE<|>Tyrion references his time at the Eyrie, where he was held captive<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>TYSHA<|>Tyrion married Tysha as a young man, though it was later revealed to be a deception<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>JAIME<|>Jaime is Tyrion's brother who set up the deception with Tysha<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>LORD TYWIN<|>Lord Tywin is Tyrion's father, who humiliated him regarding Tysha<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>STONE CROWS<|>Tyrion negotiates with the Stone Crows to spare his and Bronn's lives<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>SHAGGA<|>Tyrion interacts with Shagga, a member of the Stone Crows<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>GUNTHOR SON OF GURN<|>Tyrion negotiates with Gunthor, the chief of the Stone Crows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>VALE OF ARRYN<|>Tyrion offers the Vale of Arryn to the Stone Crows in exchange for their lives<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>SEPTON<|>The septon married Tyrion and Tysha, later revealing the truth to Lord Tywin<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYRION<|>TURNKEY<|>Tyrion bribed the turnkey with a purse of gold<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRONN<|>STONE CROWS<|>Bronn is involved in the confrontation with the Stone Crows<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRONN<|>SHAGGA<|>Bronn interacts with Shagga during the confrontation<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRONN<|>GUNTHOR SON OF GURN<|>Bronn is present during Tyrion's negotiation with Gunthor<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAIME<|>TYSHA<|>Jaime set up the deception involving Tysha<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD TYWIN<|>TYSHA<|>Lord Tywin orchestrated the humiliation of Tyrion regarding Tysha<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHAGGA<|>STONE CROWS<|>Shagga is a member of the Stone Crows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUNTHOR SON OF GURN<|>STONE CROWS<|>Gunthor is the chief of the Stone Crows<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
