Mya then tells Catelyn that \nMychel Redfort\n, a squire she loves, says she has the eyes of an owl. Catelyn\nknows that, because his family is highborn, the squire will never be allowed to marry a \nbastard\n.\nAt each way-tower they switch to fresh mules. The trip to the first way-tower does not seem too bad, but the next\npart is much steeper. At the next way-tower Mya explains that it is called Snow because, hundreds of years ago, this\nwas where the snow began. At first Catelyn thinks that, as a Tully and a Stark, there is little in the world to scare her.\nHowever, when they must lead the mules across a high saddle between to spires of rock, Catelyn finds that she is too\nscared to move. Mya comes back and escorts her, blind and trembling, step by step across. At Sky, Mya explains\nthat they must walk the last hour because the trail is more like a stone ladder. Catelyn states that, having travelled all\nday and the best part of a night, she will ride with the turnips instead.\nCatelyn finds the Eyrie, which can house 500 men, strangely empty. She is brought to her sister’s quarters. Lysa,\nnow a plump, pale, and (to Catelyn’s annoyance) well-rested woman, is polite until Ser \nVardis Egen\n and Maester\nColemon depart. Then she rages at Catelyn for bringing Tyrion to the Eyrie, and thus dragging her into Catelyn’s\nquarrel with the Lannisters. Catelyn replies that it was Lysa who sent her the letter naming the Lannisters as the\nmurderers of her husband. Lysa responds that it was a warning to avoid them, not fight them.\nRoused by his mother’s voice, young Lord Robert appears in the door, grasping a doll. Lysa introduces Catelyn to\nRobert and calls him a beautiful and strong child, warning Catelyn not to believe the stories. Lysa insists that on his\n\ndeathbed her husband said “the seed is strong” to let everyone know what a strong boy his son was. Catelyn attempts\nto bring back the subject of preparing for war, but Lysa insists that Catelyn be quiet because such talk will scare\nRobert. Lysa then exposes her breast and the six-year-old grabs for it and starts to suck.\nThe sight makes Catelyn think of her youngest son \nRickon\n, who is half this boy’s age and five times as fierce.\nCatelyn continues to press Lysa to discuss preparations for war. Lysa replies that even if the Lannisters could bring\nan army up, everyone says the Eyrie is impregnable. Catelyn realizes that her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her\nabout Lysa. Lysa then asks what she is supposed to do with Tyrion and Robert asks if he is a bad man. When Lysa\nreplies that he is, Robert says, “Make him fly.” Lysa strokes the boy’s hair and muses that perhaps that is just what\nthey will do.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn V\n↑\nEddard VIII\n ←\nCatelyn VI\n→ \nEddard IX\n↓\nCatelyn VII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 35: Eddard IX\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard VIII\n↑\nCatelyn VI\n ←\nEddard IX\n→ \nDaenerys IV\n↓\nEddard X\nLittlefinger\n leads \nNed\n to the \nbrothel\n that \nJon Arryn\n visited.

As they are returning to the \nRed Keep\n, Ned’s party is ambushed by \nJaime Lannister\n and\nabout 20 of his men. In retribution for the \nabduction\n of \nhis brother\n, Jaime has Ned’s escort killed. Ned’s leg is\nbroken during the fight, and he loses consciousness.\nSynopsis\nNed\n finds \nLittlefinger\n in the common room of the \nChataya's brothel\n talking with an elegant \nblack-skinned woman\n.\nHis guardsman \nHeward\n is gambling for the removal of clothes with a whore while \nJory Cassel\n watches from the\nwindow. Ned declares his business done, and Jory moves to bring the horses around while Littlefinger makes a joke\nabout what part of the king’s anatomy the \nHand of the King\n might be filling in for in a brothel. In no mood for\nLittlefinger’s jokes, Ned gruffly declares he is no longer the Hand. Outside, it is raining as they mount up. As they\nride the deserted streets, Littlefinger tells Ned that he is considering buying the brothel because brothels make much\nsounder investments than ships; they do not sink and pirates pay good coin like everyone else.\nAs they ride back toward the \nRed Keep\n in the rain, Ned remembers the night his sister \nLyanna\n was betrothed to\nRobert. Lyanna had told him that Robert would never keep to one bed. Ned, who had already held Robert’s first\nbastard \ndaughter\n, assured her that Robert was a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_179e029625adf35bf3edbd6cb75d06211d664d17ff162217279209ae56dee0ef_v2"}
