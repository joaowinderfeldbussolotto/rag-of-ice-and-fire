Illyrio\ntells her that they have turned to stone over the years. Khal Drogo's \nbloodriders\n give her the traditional three\nweapons, which she refuses with the traditional refusals and passes to her husband. Many other gifts come from the\nother Dothraki.\nLast of all Drogo brings forward his own bride gift, a fine grey \nfilly\n. Drogo easily lifts her by the waist up to the\nsaddle. She does not know what to do. Ser Jorah tells her to take the reins and ride. She is only a fair rider, having\ntraveled almost exclusively by other means, but as she rides, she forgets her fears and eventually sends the horse into\na gallop, and even has it leap over a firepit. She returns and tells Illyrio to tell her husband that he has given her the\nwind, and Drogo smiles. Then the sun sets and Drogo readies his horse. When Viserys warns her to please her\n\nhusband, lest she will regret it, fear comes back to her.\nDrogo sets a fast pace, saying nothing. Daenerys tries to rid herself of her fear by remembering she is the blood of\nthe dragon and the dragon is never afraid. It is full dark when they stop at a grassy place beside a small stream.\nDrogo swings off his horse and lifts her down from hers. She feels fragile in her wedding silks. She begins to weep,\nbut Drogo says \"No,\" and wipes her tears away. She asks questions but all Drogo says is “No.” He starts softly\nmurmuring to her in Dothraki to soothe her. Drogo sets her down on a rock and sits facing her, then starts removing\nthe bells from his hair, and Daenerys helps. Then he indicates that she should unbraid his hair, which takes a long\ntime. Then Drogo undresses her, with tenderness, and caresses her until she is ready for him. When he bares her\nbreasts, she covers herself with her hands but Drogo gently pulls her hands away. After he finishes undressing her,\nhe watches her for a while. Then he begins to touch her face and hair. It seems like hours to Daenerys before his\nhands go to her breasts. This makes Daenerys breathless, and when he seats her on his lap and asks “No?” she\nmoves his hand inside her and says “Yes.”\nNavigation:\nDaenerys I\n↑\nJon II\n ←\nDaenerys II\n→ \nEddard II\n↓\nDaenerys III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 12: Eddard II\nPlace(s): \nBarrowlands\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard I\n↑\nDaenerys II\n ←\nEddard II\n→ \nTyrion II\n↓\nEddard III\nNed\n and King \nRobert\n discuss the threat posed by \nDaenerys Targaryen\n's marriage and the events surrounding the\nSack of King's Landing\n.\nSynopsis\nNed\n is woken before dawn to find his horse saddled and King \nRobert\n waiting. When the king claims to have urgent\nmatters of state to discuss, Ned invites him to come inside. Robert refuses, claiming that the camp is full of ears, so\nNed dresses and mounts up.\nRobert sets a hard pace and soon the pair leave the \nkingsroad\n to ride through the \nbarrowlands\n. They do not stop until\ndawn, miles south of the main party. Exhilarated by the ride, Robert complains of the glacial pace of \nCersei\n’s\nwheelhouse and jokingly suggests that he and Ned run off to live as vagabond knights. Ned laughs and reminds\nRobert of their duties and that they are no longer the boys they once were. Robert jokes that Ned never was the boy\nhe once was, then tries to recall the name of the woman Ned fathered \nJon Snow\n with. Ned provides the name \nWylla\n,\nbut coldly refuses to say more about her.\nRobert finally gets to the business at hand: a message from the eunuch \nVarys\n, his master of whisperers in \nKing's\nLanding\n. Ned reads the message with some trepidation, thinking of \nLysa Arryn\n and her terrible accusation, but finds\nthat it concerns the \nwedding\n of \nDaenerys Targaryen\n to \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n. When Robert explains that the information has\ncome from Ser \nJorah Mormont\n, Ned takes offense, recalling Mormont as a fugitive who fled the King’s justice after\nselling some poachers to a \nTyroshi\n slaver in defiance of the law.\nThe news of the wedding does not worry Ned, but when Robert angrily suggests an assassination attempt he is not\nsurprised. Since the days of the \nrebellion\n, Robert has held a hatred for the \nTargaryens\n that seems a madness to Ned.\nNed recalls the angry words that passed between Robert and himself when \nTywin Lannister\n presented Robert with\nthe corpses of \nRhaegar Targaryen\n’s wife \nElia\n and children \nAegon\n and \nRhaenys\n as tokens of fealty.
