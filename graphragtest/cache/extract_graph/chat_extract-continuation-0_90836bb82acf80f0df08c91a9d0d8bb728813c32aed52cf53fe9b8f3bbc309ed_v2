He thinks to himself\nthat some of them might be ready for \nknighthood\n soon. However, as he wrestles with what he is planning to do that\nnight, he decides it would be worse for the boys if they were knighted by an knight without honour just before his\ndeath. He lectures the boys about honor and thinks that someday maybe they will understand. He also warns\nMissandei\n not to leave the queen's chambers, but refuses to answer her questions about his intentions. He also\n\nreflects on his own failures, one in particular; that he didn't defeat Rhaegar at the \ntourney at Harrenhal\n. Had he won,\nhe would have crowned \nAshara Dayne\n, who he was enamoured with, as \nqueen of love and beauty\n and wonders that\nif he had, would Ashara not have killed herself from grief over a child supposedly fathered on her by \na Stark\n.\nBarristan considers that his greatest failure.\nDuring the night, after bathing and donning his armour, Ser Barristan goes to confront Hizdahr in his chambers; the\nBrazen Beasts let him past without incident. Barristan, using the pretext of delivering a message to gain entrance,\ntries to question Hizdahr, demanding to know if he is in league with the \nSons of the Harpy\n and if he had anything to\ndo with the \nassassination attempt\n on Daenerys. Hizdahr's denials of the accusations do not convince Selmy, and\nwhen the old knight draws his sword, Hizdahr call for the pit fighter \nKhrazz\n, one of his guards, to defend him.\nDespite Barristan's efforts to convince Khrazz to surrender, the gladiator attacks him; however, Khrazz's\ninexperience of fighting opponents wearing armour is his downfall, and Selmy kills him quickly. Barristan tells\nHizdahr, who desperately begs for his life, that he means to take Hizdahr to a cell, where he will be imprisoned until\nDaenerys returns. Suddenly, a \ncup bearer\n informs them that \nReznak\n wishes to see the king. Barristan, surprised as he\nand Skahaz had planned to imprison Reznak as well, asks why and is told the dragons (\nViserion\n and \nRhaegal\n) have\nbeen loosed upon the city.\nNavigation:\nThe Discarded Knight\n↑\nTyrion XII\n ←\nThe Kingbreaker\n→ \nThe Dragontamer\n↓\nThe Queen's Hand\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 68: The\nDragontamer\nPlace(s): \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Spurned Suitor\n↑\nThe Kingbreaker\n ←\nThe Dragontamer\n→ \nJon XIII\nSynopsis\nQuentyn\n goes ahead with his plan to steal the dragons.

There, however, they use the codeword \"dog\" on the \nBrazen Beasts\n,\nwho are actually part of the scheme to overthrow the king that very night. A fight ensues, and the four guards are\nslain, although Quentyn is almost slain by a spear. They enter and find that Rhaegal has also broken his chains since\nhe was last in the pit, and that Viserion has created a cave for himself in the ceiling of the pit. Viserion is first\nattracted to \nPretty Meris\n, as he is looking for Daenerys, but then tries to exit the pit. Throughout this encounter,\nQuentyn tries to dominate the dragons like he had seen \nDaenerys\n do with \nDrogon\n, but when he strikes Viserion with\na whip, Rhaegal spews fire on him, setting him aflame.\nNavigation:\nThe Spurned Suitor\n↑\nThe Kingbreaker\n ←\nThe Dragontamer\n→ \nJon XIII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 69: Jon XIII\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon XII\n↑\nThe Dragontamer\n ←\nJon XIII\n→ \nThe Queen's Hand\nSynopsis\nJon\n means to lead men to \nHardhome\n to rescue the \nwildlings\n and men of the \nNight's Watch\n trapped there. \nQueen\nSelyse\n and \nMelisandre\n discourage him, and want to leave them to their fate.
