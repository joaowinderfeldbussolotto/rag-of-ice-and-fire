He\nremembers the stories \nOld Nan\n told about ghosts, terrible dungeons, and dragon skulls on the walls. He dreams of\nbeing a member of the \nKingsguard\n someday and is anxious to meet the greatest living knight, Ser \nBarristan the Bold\n.\nBut now Bran is also apprehensive about leaving the only home he has ever known. He will miss all those he is\nleaving behind, even his pony.\nNot being able to stand the goodbyes, Bran goes to the castle \ngodswood\n with his \ndirewolf\n. Unlike all his siblings, he\nstill hasn’t named his wolf; none of the names he tries seem right. Eventually, Bran gets tired of trying to teach his\nwolf to fetch and decides to go climbing. His wolf doesn’t want him to go and howls when he climbs away up a tree\nand onto the armory roof.\nBran spends much of his time climbing the roofs of Winterfell. His \nmother\n claims that he could climb before he\ncould walk. Since Bran cannot remember learning to climb or learning to walk he assumes it must be true. His\nmother is also terrified that one day he might fall and kill himself. Once Bran kept a promise not to climb for almost\na fortnight and was miserable the entire time. Finally he gave in, but confessed his crime the next day. When his\nfather\n ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself, they found him sleeping in the tallest tree in the grove the\nnext morning. His father, angry and laughing, told him that from now on he was free to climb, so long as his mother\ndidn’t catch him.\nOthers have tried to stop him, but to no avail. The guards tried to stop him, but they were too slow and escaping\nfrom them was fun. Old Nan once told a story of a boy who climbed too high and was struck by lightning and had\nhis eyes eaten by crows, but Bran likes to feed the crows and they never seem interested in eating his eyes. \nMaester\nLuwin\n made a clay boy and threw it off the wall as an example, but Bran only responded that he is not made of clay\nand he never falls.\nBran is climbing toward the Broken Tower, where he likes to feed the crows, when he is startled by voices from the\nFirst Keep, the oldest part of the castle. At first he doesn’t recognize them as Queen \nCersei\n and her brother, Ser\nJaime\n. Cersei is telling Jaime that he should be the \nHand of the King\n and that Eddard Stark will put them in danger\nbecause the king loves him like a brother. Jaime jokes that Robert hates his brothers. Unamused, Cersei insists that\nRobert will listen to Eddard. Jaime states that he prefers honorable men to ambitious men like Robert’s brothers and\nLittlefinger\n.\nCersei says she is worried about what \nLysa Arryn\n may have said to the Starks, but Jaime tells her not to worry, as\n\nLysa has no proof. Despite this, Cersei remains fearful that Eddard might betray her son \nJoffrey\n when he takes the\nthrone or convince Robert to put her aside.\nBran grows frightened by what he overhears but wants to see who is talking, so he climbs over the window, then\ndrops down. He can see the man and woman inside, naked and wrestling, fondling, and moaning. He recognizes\nCersei just as her eyes open and she sees him. Bran loses his grip as he tries to escape, but he catches himself on the\nwindow ledge. Cersei and Jaime come to look at him. Jaime extends a hand to Bran and pulls him up onto the ledge.\nAs Bran begins to relax, Jaime asks him how old he is. Bran tells him he is seven. Then Jaime loathingly says, “The\nthings I do for love,” and shoves Bran backwards out the window into the empty air.\nNavigation:\nBran I\n↑\nArya I\n ←\nBran II\n→ \nTyrion I\n↓\nBran III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 9: Tyrion I\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran II\n ←\nTyrion I\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nTyrion II\nTyrion\n meets up with his nephew \nJoffrey\n and insists he pay his sympathies to the Starks, before joining his \nbrother\nand \nsister\n for breakfast with news that \nBran Stark\n will probably survive.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n has been reading all night in Winterfell's library when he hears a wolf howl. He gives up on reading, noticing\nthat it's near dawn and that Septon \nChayle\n is asleep. Tyrion wakes him and goes out to break his fast. As he leaves,\nTyrion hears \nSandor Clegane\n complaining about how long \nBran Stark\n is taking to die. \nPrince Joffrey\n states that at\nleast Bran is dying quietly, but the wolf's howling is disturbing his sleep. The Hound offers to go kill it, which\nJoffrey finds amusing, believing the \nStarks\n would not notice it missing. Tyrion notes that the Starks can count past\nsix, unlike some princes.\nThe Hound uses the remark as an excuse to make fun of Tyrion's height. Tyrion brushes the comment off before\nadvising Joff\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4f2321c2d6ab6aed6dd5b45943d8beb38e6582160b0d3bf8053824cfd5a0be1a_v2"}
