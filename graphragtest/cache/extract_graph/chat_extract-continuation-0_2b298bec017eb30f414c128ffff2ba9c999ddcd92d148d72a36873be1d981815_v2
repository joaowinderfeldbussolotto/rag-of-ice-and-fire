Some time in the middle of the night, Cersei visits him with news of \nKevan\n's refusal to become her \nHand\n,\nas well as remarking that Kevan knows about their relationship. She implores Jaime to reconsider being Hand, but\nJaime rejects her again. She departs with, \"Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you.\" The\nnext morning, the mourners arrive anew, but the smell is so nauseating that \nTommen\n gets sick. Jaime takes him\noutside to console him, advising him to \"go away inside\", something Tommen understands from when \nJoffrey\n would\ntorment him. Cersei then joins them, as does \nMace Tyrell\n, and Jaime asks the Lord of \nHighgarden\n to have dinner\nwith his sister. When Mace departs, Jaime tells Cersei to get the wedding over with, and then send Lord Mace to\nbesiege \nStorm's End\n once again.

The area surrounding it is littered with\ncorpses of both northmen and men from \nthe Reach\n.\nThe gates open at morning, and the captain tells Brienne that his sister can paint over the black bat of \nLothston\n on\nher shield. After finding and telling the sister what sigil she wants, Brienne heads to the \nDun Fort\n to speak to the\nlord. Since Lord \nRykker\n is in the field, she meets with the castellan Ser \nRufus Leek\n and a maester, who tells her that\nmany came before her asking if \nDontos Hollard\n and \nSansa\n had come to Duskendale. The Dun Fort's maester tells the\nstory of the \nDefiance of Duskendale\n, which seems to have been the incident that finally sent \nKing Aerys\n over the\nedge.\nEither of his own initiative, or from the urgings of \nhis wife\n, \nDenys Darklyn\n took Aerys hostage. When \nTywin\nLannister\n (who was \nHand\n at the time) surrounded the Dun Fort, Lord Darklyn threatened to kill Aerys. When Aerys\nwas captured, \nSymon Hollard\n killed one of his kingsguard, Ser \nGwayne Gaunt\n.\nAfter \nBarristan the Bold\n slipped into the Dun Fort and rescued the king, Aerys had nearly every member of the\nDarklyn\n and \nHollard\n families killed or attainted. \nDontos\n, who was young at the time, survived because Barristan\nasked Aerys to stay his hand.\nThe castellan tells Brienne that Duskendale would have been the last place Dontos would have fled to. Despairing\nthat she will never find Sansa, Brienne bumps into a skinny boy whom she also saw back at \nRosby\n on a \npiebald\nrounsey\n, but he runs away.\nVisiting the \nSeven Swords\n inn for dinner, Brienne meets a \npious dwarf\n, who tells her that he overheard a man called\nNimble \nDick\n in \nMaidenpool\n bragging that he had \n\"fooled a \nfool\n\"\n seeking passage for three across the \nNarrow Sea\n.\nThat night, Brienne dreams of \nRenly\n's death, but when he topples after the shadow killed him, the body is that of\nJaime\n.\nThe next day, Brienne picks up her shield, painted with the sigil that \nTanselle\n had painted for Ser \nDuncan the Tall\n.\nProceeding to Maidenpool, Brienne camps by the ruins of the Hollard castle, and hears a rider. Fearing it may be Ser\nShadrich\n and that a battle might ensue, she discovers the boy who seems to be stalking her. It turns out to be \nPodrick\nPayne\n, who asks to stay with her, hoping that if she finds Sansa, it may lead the boy back to \nTyrion\n.\nNavigation:\nBrienne I\n↑\nJaime I\n ←\nBrienne II\n→ \nSansa I\n↓\nBrienne III\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 10: Sansa I\nPlace(s): \nthe \nEyrie\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VII\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nBrienne II\n ←\nSansa I\n→ \nThe Kraken's Daughter\n↓\nAlayne I\nSynopsis\nMarillion\n is singing day and night.
