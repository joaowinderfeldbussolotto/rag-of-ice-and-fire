We also learn that \nRobett Glover\n has been put on a ship at \nDuskendale\n as\npart of the agreement. Robb left \nhis wife\n at \nRiverrun\n, and only Ser \nRaynald Westerling\n travels with them. Robb has\nbrought 3,500 men with him, those who have been with him since the \nBattle of the Whispering Wood\n, and who will\nfollow him to \nMoat Cailin\n after the wedding. While passing through \nthe site of the battle\n, Catelyn thinks of \nTheon\nGreyjoy\n boasting he had almost crossed swords with Ser \nJaime\n and how much ill would have been undone if Theon\nhad died in place of \nLord Karstark\n’s sons.\nWhen they reach \nOldstones\n, Cat recalls that the ruins were once a great castle of the \nRiver Kings\n during the \nMudd\nDynasty\n. The Mudds were \nFirst Men\n, but during the time of King \nTristifer IV\n, the kingdoms of the First Men were\nfalling before the onslaught of the \nAndals\n. Tristifer IV died when seven Andal kings joined forces against him.\nRobb tells his mother that he plans to legitimize his brother \nJon\n and name him heir should he and Jeyne not have a\nchild. Catelyn is stunned by this proclamation, and pleads with him not to make the mistake the \nTargaryens\n made\nwhen King \nAegon IV Targaryen\n legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed. The \nBlackfyre Pretenders\n plagued the\nTargaryens for five generations until Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n slew \nMaelys Blackfyre\n on the \nStepstones\n. They both fear\nthat \nSansa\n will give \nthe Imp\n a son and thus control of \nWinterfell\n and agree that must be prevented. She pleads that\nRobb consider naming his sister \nArya\n as heir, but Robb insists that no one has seen Arya since \nhis father's\n death and\nthat his sister is likely also dead. Catelyn tells Robb that she cannot support his choice of Jon but Robb reminds her\nthat he doesn't have to ask for her support, stating his reason as, \"I'm the King.\"\nJason Mallister\n soon joins Robb’s force at \nHag's Mire\n, bringing with him the captain of the \nMyraham\n. The man tells\nthem that \nBalon Greyjoy\n fell to his death when a wind blew him off one of the bridges between the towers of \nPyke\n,\nand no sooner was he dead than \nEuron Crow’s Eye\n returned and claimed the \nSeastone Chair\n, naming himself King\nof the Iron Islands and the North. Knowing \nVictarion\n and \nAsha\n will not stand still for this, Robb commands \nMaege\nMormont\n and \nGalbart Glover\n to take men by longship and sail through the marshes of \nthe Neck\n to seek out \nHowland\nReed\n. Robb plans to march on Moat Cailin with 12,000 men once he joins with \nRoose Bolton\n. The \ncrannogmen\n will\nguide a small force under Robb’s command across the swamps in order to reach Moat Cailin from the north. When\nGalbart warns him what should happen if the crannogmen were to fail him, Robb replies, \"They will not fail. My\nfather knew the worth of Howland Reed.\" Robb then announces that Catelyn will be taken to \nSeagard\n under the\nprotection of Lord Jason after the wedding. He then calls his bannermen to fix their seals as witnesses to the decree\nnaming his heir.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn IV\n↑\nJaime VI\n ←\nCatelyn V\n→ \nSamwell III\n↓\nCatelyn VI\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 46: Samwell III\nPlace(s): \nabandoned village in the \nhaunted forest\n \n \nNavigation:\nSamwell II\n↑\nCatelyn V\n ←\nSamwell III\n→ \nArya IX\n↓\nSamwell IV\nSynopsis\nSam\n and \nGilly\n have reached what appears to be \nWhitetree\n.
