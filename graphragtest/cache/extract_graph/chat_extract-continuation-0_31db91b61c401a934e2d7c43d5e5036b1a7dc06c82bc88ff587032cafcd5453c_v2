He and \nLark\n the Sisterman are conspiring to desert the \nNight's Watch\n, along with \nSmall Paul\n and\nabout a dozen other sworn brothers. The traitors plan to kill Lord Commander \nMormont\n and several other officers to\nprevent anyone from actively seeking them out after they desert.\nThoren Smallwood\n and his party are the only of the three rangings to return so far, and they have seen the size of\nMance Rayder\n’s army. Thoren wishes to give battle to Mance’s army, mainly because there are so few warriors in it,\nit's composed of mostly women and children. Chett and his men plan to kill in the dead of night, and flee to places of\nsafety, leaving Thoren Smallwood and \nOttyn Wythers\n as senior rangers. Thoren won’t search for them because he\nwants to lead the attack, and Wythers would rather flee to the Wall and could not care less about deserters. That\nevening, the Watch gathers before Mormont and his senior men, who announce that they will march in force against\nthe \nwildling\n army, which is about ten days away. Mormont acknowledges that they might all die and has his men\nreaffirm their oaths to the Night's Watch. Meanwhile, Chett worries that some of his deserters may lose their resolve.\nLate in the night, Chett awakens to find it snowing. The desertion plans are ruined because the turn cloaks can be\neasily tracked in the fresh snow. Chett still seeks to get some satisfaction from the night and creeps over to the\nsleeping Samwell Tarly, with the intention of murdering him. He is interrupted as a ranger in the distance sounds his\nhorn. Sam awakens, and he and Chett hear the horn blow three times. Both men are shocked at the realization of\nwhat three horn blows mean, a signal that has not been used in hundreds and thousands of years. Three horn blows\nmean \nOthers\n. Chett looks down and realizes he has wet himself.\nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nJaime I\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 1: Jaime I\nPlace(s): \nAboard a boat on the \nRed Fork\n of the \nTrident\n on the way to \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nPrologue\n ←\nJaime I\n→ \nCatelyn I\n↓\nJaime II\nSynopsis\nSer \nJaime\n is being escorted to \nKing's Landing\n by \nBrienne\n and his cousin, Ser \nCleos Frey\n, by boat.

The oath was sworn at sword point and while drunk,\nand Jaime considers killing Brienne and getting away. He is still chained hand and foot.\nJaime ponders \nCersei's\n feelings with him after the \nBran\n incident and wonders if she sent the assassin to Bran's room,\nbut dismisses that notion thinking that she would have sent Jaime himself to do the dirty work. Their boat is moving\ndown the \nRed Fork\n of the \nTrident\n, and Jaime has Cleos shave his head so he will be less recognizable should they\nget caught. He and Brienne treat each other with contempt. She stops their boat to cut down and bury several tavern\nwenches hanging in the trees. Jaime mocks Brienne because a note reveals the women were killed by \nnorthmen\n,\nmost likely Bolton men, for servicing \nLannister\n men.\nTheir trip is interrupted when Brienne spots a river galley bearing down on them. The galley is under the command\nof Ser \nRobin Ryger\n, sent by Ser \nEdmure Tully\n to return the Kingslayer to Riverrun. Brienne jumps out of the skiff\nand climbs a cliff face. Jaime distracts the men on the galley by challenging Robin to single combat while Brienne\ndislodges a large boulder which crashes down on the galley, sinking it. When Brienne swims back to the skiff, Jaime\nconsiders smashing her in the face with his oar, but instead pulls her into the boat.
