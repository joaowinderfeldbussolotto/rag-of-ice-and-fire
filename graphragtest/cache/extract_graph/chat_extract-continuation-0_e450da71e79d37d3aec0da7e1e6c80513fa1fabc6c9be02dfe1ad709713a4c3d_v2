Refusing to back down\non his first day, Tyrion introduces \nBronn\n and \nTimett\n. After Ser Mandon learns that Bronn \nkilled\n Ser \nVardis Egen\n, he\nallows Tyrion to enter. Tyrion relishes that he has passed his first test.\nWhen Cersei sees him, she exclaims “You!” with equal parts disbelief and distaste. Taking care to act confident in\nfront of her, Tyrion remarks that he can see where \nJoffrey\n learned his courtesies. When Cersei asks why he is there,\nTyrion saunters over to deliver their lord father’s letter. \nVarys\n inspects the seal and proclaims it genuine before\nCersei snatches it. Cersei has taken the king’s seat, so Tyrion takes the Hand’s chair, which seems only appropriate.\nCersei declares the letter absurd and explains that her father has authorized Tyrion to act as \nHand of the King\n in his\nabsence.\nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n offers greetings, and Lord \nJanos Slynt\n declares that there is need of Tyrion with rioting in the\nstreets and a \ngrim omen\n in the sky. Cersei lashes out that Slynt is the one in charge of keeping order and that Tyrion\nwould serve them better on the battlefield. Tyrion replies that he is done with fighting, preferring the finer things in\nlife. \nLittlefinger\n declares Tyrion a man after his own heart, which reminds Tyrion that he must have a talk with\nLittlefinger about a certain dagger used in an \nattempt\n on \nBran Stark\n’s life.\nCersei is not happy to learn that Tyrion has brought only a few hundred men; she is worried that \nStannis\n or \nRenly\nBaratheon\n will attack the city. Then she declares that only the king can name a Hand, and Joffrey has named Lord\nTywin. Tyrion points out that Lord Tywin named him and recommends that Cersei take it up with him at \nHarrenhal\n.\nTyrion requests a private moment with Cersei, and the other councillors excuse themselves. As he leaves,\nLittlefinger asks about living arrangements. Tyrion says he plans to take up residence in the \nTower of the Hand\n.\nLittlefinger declares Tyrion a braver man than him, considering the fate of the last two Hands. Tyrion corrects this to\nfour, explaining that \nAerys\n's \nlast Hand\n died in the \nSack of King's Landing\n, and \nthe one before him\n was burned to\ndeath. The two before them were luckier in that they merely died penniless in exile. Littlefinger japes that in that\ncase he would sooner bed down in the dungeon than the Tower of the Hand, and Tyrion privately thinks that\nLittlefinger might get that wish.\nOnce they are alone, Cersei asks why their father would ignore her royal command and inflict Tyrion on her. Tyrion\npoints out that Lord Tywin has a large army and can do that, nor is he the first to do so. Cersei threatens to call the\nletter a forgery and throw Tyrion in a dungeon. Tyrion agrees that no one—not even their father—would protest, but\n\nasks why Cersei would want to do such a thing when he has come to help. Cersei insists that it was their father’s\nhelp she wanted, but Tyrion can tell that it is Jaime she really wants, so he promises that if she supports him he will\nfind a way to free Jaime. Cersei asks how, given that \nRobb\n and \nCatelyn\n \nStark\n are not likely to forget the beheading\nof Lord \nEddard\n. Tyrion notes that Cersei still holds the Stark daughters, forcing Cersei to reveal that she only has\nSansa\n; she sent Ser \nMeryn Trant\n to apprehend \nArya\n, but her \ndancing master\n interfered and the girl escaped and is\nlikely dead.\nTyrion asks Cersei if she trusts the small council, since their father does not; Joffrey’s short reign has been full of\nfollies and disasters, which suggests the king is getting some very bad counsel. Cersei concedes that Joffrey, always\nwillful, now believes that as king he is free to do as he pleases, not as he is bid. She explains that Joffrey was\ninstructed to allow Eddard Stark to \ntake the black\n but took it upon himself to order Eddard killed, and Janos Slynt\nand Ser \nIlyn Payne\n were quick to take the command. Cersei also mentions that as a result, the \nHigh Septon\n is\naccusing them of lying to him and profaning the \nGreat Sept of Baelor\n.\nTyrion then questions Cersei about Slynt, asking whose idea it was to make him Lord of Harrenhal and a member of\nthe small council. Cersei replies that Littlefinger made the arrangements; they needed the \ngold cloaks\n on their side to\nstop Eddard Stark before he handed the throne over to Stannis Baratheon. Cersei adds that it was close even so; all\nmight have been lost if Sansa had not come to Cersei with her father’s plans. Tyrion expresses surprise that Sansa\nwould betray her own father's plans, but Cersei explains that the girl was in love with Joffrey and would have done\nanything
