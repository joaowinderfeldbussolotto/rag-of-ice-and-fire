After his recovery, Petyr had been sent away and Catelyn has not seen him since. Rodrik\nproposes that he go to the Red Keep alone because, without his whiskers, he is unrecognizable even to the few who\nmight know him.\nAfter they disembark, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik move into a modest old inn suggested by the ship's captain. After\nRodrik leaves, Catelyn tries to get some sleep but is woken by the \nCity Watch of King's Landing\n. They show her a\nseal depicting a mockingbird in grey wax, the sigil of Petyr Baelish. As she prepares to accompany the soldiers (who\ndo not recognize her), Catelyn wonders how Petyr knew she was in King’s Landing and settles on \nStorm Dancer's\ncaptain as the culprit.\nCatelyn is escorted to a tower room occupied by Petyr. When Catelyn asks how he knew she was in the city, Petyr\nreplies that \nVarys\n knows everything that happens in the city. He does admit, however, that Varys does not know the\nreason for Catelyn's visit. Catelyn lies that she merely yearned to see her husband and daughters. Petyr does not\nbelieve this for a moment and asks Catelyn to let him help.\nBefore Catelyn can answer they are joined by Varys. After profuse courtesies, Varys asks to see the dagger. Catelyn\nis astounded by Varys's knowledge of things no one could possibly know and produces the dagger for inspection.\nUpon examining the weapon, Petyr reveals that it once belonged to him until he lost it betting on Ser \nJaime\nLannister\n in the \ntourney on Prince Joffrey's name day\n. Petyr explains that when Jaime was unhorsed by Ser \nLoras\nTyrell\n, Petyr's dagger was won by \nTyrion Lannister\n.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n↑\nBran III\n ←\nCatelyn IV\n→ \nJon III\n↓\n\nCatelyn V\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 19: Jon III\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon II\n↑\nCatelyn III\n ←\nJon III\n→ \nEddard IV\n↓\nJon IV\nAfter training, \nJon Snow\n is attacked by several other recruits but saved by \nDonal Noye\n, who shows Jon the error of\nhis ways. Then Jon meets up with \nTyrion\n and later learns from the Lord Commander that \nBran\n has awoken.\nSynopsis\nJon\n is training with the other recruits under \nCastle Black\n’s master-at-arms, Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n. Jon is by far the most\nskilled swordsman and during a sparring match he accidentally injures \nGrenn\n. Disgusted with the recruits, Thorne\ncalls an end to training for the day. Jon knows that Thorne dislikes him, but that he dislikes the other boys more.\nThorne mercilessly berates them all and has given Jon the moniker “Lord Snow” in mockery of Jon’s bastard status.\nTo Jon’s annoyance, everyone has taken up using the name.\nJon has found Castle Black cold and the people colder. He has no friends among the 20 recruits and finds that he\ndespises them more as time goes by. Jon resents that nobody but \nTyrion Lannister\n told him that \nthe Wall\n would be\nlike this. The fact that even \nhis father\n never told him makes it hurt all the worse. Even Jon’s uncle \nBenjen\n seems to\nhave abandoned him, becoming a very different man who spends all his time among the high officers. Three days\nafter arriving at the Wall, Jon had pleaded to be allowed to come on a ranging with his uncle. Benjen had told him\nthat he was just a boy who had yet to earn the right to go. Benjen also explained that, while he loved \nhis family\n, the\nmen of the \nNight's Watch\n are his true brothers. The next morning, Benjen had had smiles, but not for Jon, telling\nhim that they would speak when he returns.\nJon goes to his sleeping cell to be with \nGhost\n, thinking of how much he misses his family. His thoughts are\ninterrupted by the arrival of Grenn, \nToad\n, and two other recruits. All of them are brutes and bullies sent to the Wall\nfor crimes. After Grenn insults Jon’s mother, a short fight breaks out that soon has Jon on the ground. However,\nbefore the boys can hurt Jon, \nDonal Noye\n the smith intervenes.\nAfter the others leave, Noye tells Jon that the Night’s Watch has need of every man and that there is no honor in\nkilling boys like Grenn. When Jon insists that they insulted his mother, Noye points out that them saying it doesn’t\nmake it true. When Noye reminds Jon that he is in the Night's Watch for life, Jon reflects angrily on the fact that\nDonal Noye had a life before taking the black. He feasted and wenched and fought in battles, only taking the black\nafter losing an arm during the siege of \nPyke\n.\nJon claims that the others hate him because he is better than them, but Noye insists that they hate him because he\nthinks\n he is better.
