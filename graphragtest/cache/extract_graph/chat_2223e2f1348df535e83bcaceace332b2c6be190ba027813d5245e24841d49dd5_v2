Jon decides he is thankful his bastardy has\nrelegated him to the far end of the hall with the younger squires instead of the king's family. Here he can drink as\nmuch as he wants (he has a man’s thirst) and mingle freely with those around him.\nJon watches the king and his family as they arrive. He recognizes Queen \nCersei\n's false smile and is disappointed\nwith fat, red-faced King Robert. The 8-year-old Princess \nMyrcella\n seems smitten with her escort \nRobb\n, leading Jon\nto decide she is insipid. \nArya\n is escorted by plump, young Prince \nTommen\n. The 12-year-old Crown Prince \nJoffrey\n(who is even taller than Robb) is escorting the radiant \nSansa\n. Jon decides he does not like Joffrey’s pouty lips or the\ndisdain the prince seems to hold for Winterfell. He also notes that the queen's brother \nJaime Lannister\n looks like a\nproper king, and that waddling dwarf \nTyrion Lannister\n is grotesquely fascinating, as ugly as Jaime and Cersei are\nbeautiful. The last to enter are \nBenjen Stark\n and \nTheon Greyjoy\n.\nJon feeds his \ndirewolf\n \nGhost\n under the table and watches the pup silently face down a full-grown dog three times his\nsize. Bringing his wolf to the feast is another perk to being the bastard. Jon is soon joined by his uncle Benjen, who\nasks Jon how much he's had to drink, adding that Jon is older than he was when he first got truly drunk. Benjen asks\nabout Ghost and Jon explains that he named him Ghost for his white color and because he never makes a sound.\nBenjen then asks why Jon is not at the main table and Jon says flatly that Lady \nCatelyn\n thought seating a bastard\nwith the king might give offense.\nBenjen comments that \nEddard\n does not seem festive and Jon adds that neither does the queen, probably because of\nKing Robert's visit to the crypts. Benjen commends Jon's keen observation and remarks that he could use a man like\nhim on \nthe Wall\n. Jon asks if he can return to the Wall with Benjen. Benjen replies that the Wall is a hard place for a\nboy, but Jon counters that he will turn 15 on his next name day and it's said bastards grow up faster than purebloods.\nJon thinks about how all his half brothers and sisters have futures, but there is no future for a bastard. Benjen says\nthat he should know a woman and father a bastard or two first, to know what he will be giving up. This angers Jon,\nwho states that he will \nnever\n father a bastard and runs off with Ghost at his heels before anyone can see him cry.\nAs Jon is leaving, Tyrion Lannister speaks to him from a ledge in the deserted yard and asks if he can take a look at\nGhost. Jon offers to help him down, but Tyrion jumps down, acrobatically landing on his hands and vaulting to his\nfeet. Ghost is uncertain about Tyrion, but submits to examination at Jon's command. Tyrion asks if Jon is Eddard's\nbastard. Jon bridles and Tyrion apologizes that as a dwarf he can usually speak as he pleases, like a jester. He\ncomments that Jon seems to have more of \nthe North\n in him than his half-siblings. Tyrion advises Jon never to forget\nwho and what he is so that no one can use it against him. When Jon questions what Tyrion would know about being\na bastard, Tyrion replies that all dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes and that, although all dwarfs are bastards,\nnot all bastards need to be dwarfs.\nNavigation:\nEddard I\n ←\nJon I\n→ \nCatelyn II\n↓\n\nJon II\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 6: Catelyn II\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn I\n↑\nJon I\n ←\nCatelyn II\n→ \nArya I\n↓\nCatelyn III\nA secret letter from \nher sister\n leads \nCatelyn\n to convince \nNed\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2223e2f1348df535e83bcaceace332b2c6be190ba027813d5245e24841d49dd5_v2"}
