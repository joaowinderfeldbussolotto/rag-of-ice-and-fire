Arya can see it as a sword as well, but to her it is her father’s greatsword \nIce\n, covered with her father’s blood\nas it was after his head was cut off.\nWhen she finally falls asleep, Arya dreams of Winterfell. She longs to see \nher mother\n, \nRobb\n, \nBran\n, and \nRickon\n, but\nmore than anyone she misses her brother \nJon\n on the Wall. She wishes that somehow they could come to the Wall\nbefore Winterfell, just so she could see Jon again.\nNavigation:\nArya V\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nPrologue\n ←\nArya I\n→ \nSansa I\n↓\nArya II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 2: Sansa I\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n - The \nRed Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VI\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nArya I\n ←\nSansa I\n→ \nTyrion I\n↓\nSansa II\nSansa Stark\n attends the \ntourney on King Joffrey's name day\n. After several poor contests, \nJoffrey\n becomes enraged\nwhen Ser \nDontos Hollard\n arrives half naked and too drunk to compete. Sansa manages to convince Joffrey to make\nDontos his new fool instead of executing him. Afterward, while Prince \nTommen\n is riding against a quintain, \nTyrion\nLannister\n arrives to assume his position as acting \nHand of the King\n.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n is watching the long tail of the \nred comet\n from her tower window when Ser \nArys Oakheart\n arrives to escort\nher to the \ntourney on King Joffrey's name day\n. She asks him what it means. Ser Arys declares that it means glory to\nher betrothed, King \nJoffrey\n; the gods have raised it as a banner in his honor, and the smallfolk have named it “King\nJoffrey’s Comet”. Sansa is not so sure and replies that she has heard the servants call it the “Dragon’s Tail.” Ser\nArys replies that Joffrey sits on \nAegon the Dragon\n’s \nthrone\n and crimson is the color of \nHouse Lannister\n, so it must\nmean he will triumph over his enemies. Sansa wonders apprehensively if this is true, since her \nmother\n and \nbrother\nare among Joffrey’s enemies. Yet Joffrey is a \nBaratheon\n as much as a Lannister, so his comet should be gold.\nSer Arys compliments Sansa on her gown, whose long sleeves hide the bruises given to her by Ser \nBoros Blount\n at\nJoffrey’s command when he learned that her brother \nRobb\n had been proclaimed \nKing in the North\n. Of all the\nKingsguard\n, Ser Arys is always courteous to Sansa, and is her preferred escort since he is the only one who objects\nto hitting her and never hits hard. The others all obey without question, except \nSandor Clegane\n, but Joffrey never\ncommands the \nHound\n to hit her.\nAs they walk, Sansa asks who will win the tourney. Ser Arys states he will, though there will be only 40 contestants,\nand there is small honor in unhorsing green boys. Sansa muses that this will be very different from the magnificent\nHand's tourney\n. With King \nRobert\n dead and three kings vying for power it is not surprising that Joffrey’s tourney\nmust be held within the \nRed Keep\n. Sansa asks if Queen \nCersei\n will attend, but learns that the queen has urgent\nbusiness with the \nsmall council\n. Ser Arys also mentions that Cersei is furious that \nTywin Lannister\n will not bring his\narmy to the city as commanded.\nThe pitiful crowd in the small outer bailey fills only half the seats. Most of the spectators are \ngold cloaks\n or wear the\ncrimson of House Lannister. Only a few are nobility: grey-faced Lord \nGyles Rosby\n, Lady \nTanda Stokeworth\n with\nher daughters \nFalyse\n and \nLollys\n, the exiled prince \nJalabhar Xho\n, and Lady \nErmesande Hayford\n, who is only a baby.\nThe Hound announces Sansa’s arrival at the royal box. Princess \nMyrcella\n gives a shy nod, but Prince \nTommen\nexcitedly tells her that he is to ride in the tourney. Joffrey quickly interjects that Tommen will be riding against a\nstraw quintain. After Ser Arys excuses himself, Joffrey studies Sansa and declares he is pleased she wore the stones\nhe gave her. Sansa is relieved that Joffrey has chosen to play the gallant today.\nOnce Sansa is seated, Joffrey informs her that the Beggar King \nViserys Targaryen\n is dead. Joffrey is amused by the\nirony of a \ndragon king\n being \nkilled\n with a molten gold crown. He suggests that perhaps he will feed Sansa’s brother\nRobb to wolves and boasts that he intends to challenge Robb to single combat. Sansa states that she would like to\nsee that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_154e177eea3310e822b22d9f5b4e4ca6e8abbd202ad582b2d99345b9affcbc0b_v2"}
