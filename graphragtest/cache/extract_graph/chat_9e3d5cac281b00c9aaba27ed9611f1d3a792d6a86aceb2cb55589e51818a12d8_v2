Cersei admits that she\nand Jaime have been lovers since they were children and that when Jaime is in her she feels whole. When Ned asks\nabout his son Bran, Cersei admits that he saw her and Jaime, offering her love for her own children as a reason for\nthe attempted murder. Ned counters with a declaration that all three of Cersei’s children are Jaime’s. The last time a\nBaratheon\n had a child with a \nLannister\n was 90 years before when \nTya Lannister\n wedded \nGowen Baratheon\n; the\nsingle child was large and lusty boy with a full head of black hair. Thirty years before that a Lannister had taken a\nBaratheon maid; all the children had black hair. According to \nThe Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the\nSeven Kingdoms\n, the children of a Lannister and a Baratheon always had black hair.\nNed asks Cersei how it is possible that she never had a child by the king, and she admits she almost did but had the\nchild aborted. Cersei goes on to claim that she cannot stand to even touch Robert now, and has not let him inside her\nfor years. Instead she pleasures the king in other ways when he leaves his whores long enough; Robert is always so\ndrunk that he never remembers.\nWhen Ned asks what made her hate Robert so much, Cersei reveals that on their wedding night Robert called her\n“\nLyanna\n” in the midst of the consummation. The story leads Ned to declare that he does not know which of them to\npity more, but that he must still do his duty. Cersei makes a sexual advance on Ned while telling him that the realm\nneeds a strong Hand and that he will never regret being kind to her. Ned immediately rejects the advance by asking\nif she made the same offer to \nJon Arryn\n and she slaps him. Offended by Ned’s honorable persona, Cersei brings up\nJon Snow\n and accuses Ned of many other possible debaucheries.\nNed makes it clear that he intends to tell Robert everything when he returns and warns Cersei to leave \nKing's\nLanding\n. He recommends that she take a ship to the \nFree Cities\n with all her immediate family, including \nher father\n,\nto escape Robert’s wrath. Cersei stands, laughs, and declares Ned a fool for not taking the throne himself fourteen\nyears before, when he forced Jaime to surrender the seat. Ned replies that he has made more mistakes than Cersei\ncan imagine, but that was not one of them. Cersei insists that it was, saying \"When you play the game of thrones,\nyou win or you die. There is no middle ground.\"\nNavigation:\nEddard XI\n↑\nSansa III\n ←\nEddard XII\n→ \nDaenerys V\n↓\nEddard XIII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 46: Daenerys V\nPlace(s): \nVaes Dothrak\n - \nWomb of the World\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys IV\n↑\nEddard XII\n ←\nDaenerys V\n→ \nEddard XIII\n↓\nDaenerys VI\nDaenerys\n eats a \nstallion heart\n as part of a \nDothraki\n pregnancy ritual. Afterwards she baths in the \nWomb of the World\nand goes to the reception feast. \nViserys\n soon arrives, drunk and screaming. He draws his blade and demands what he\nis owed. \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n gives him a crown of molten gold.\nSynopsis\nThe \nstallion’s heart\n is still raw and steaming when it is placed before \nDaenerys\n. As part of the ancient \nDothraki\nmotherhood ritual she begins to eat the tough, stringy flesh. The Dothraki believe that the heart of the stallion will\nmake her son strong and swift and fearless. If she chokes on the blood or retches the omens are less favorable: the\nchild could be weak, deformed, stillborn, or female. In preparation, Daenerys has eaten bowls of blood and dried\nhorse flesh and fasted for a day and a half, yet still her stomach roils and her jaw aches.\nKhal\n \nDrogo\n stands over her as she eats, his face hard, but as she continues Daenerys begins to see pride in his eyes.\nWhen she is done, Daenerys pronounces the words she has rehearsed to the \ndosh khaleen\n, the crones of \nVaes\nDothrak\n. Even the most powerful \nkhals\n bow to the wisdom and authority of these crones, each of whom is the\nkhaleesi\n of a dead \nkhal\n.\nThe crones proclaim, “The prince is riding; a boy, a boy, a strong boy,” and begin to chant. After the crowd finishes\nchanting there is silence. Then one of the crones announces the greatness of the new prince, the \nStallion Who\nMounts the World\n. Daenerys reveals the name of her son: \nRhaego\n, in honor of her \nolder brother\n.\nKhal Drogo leads her out of the pit with his \nbloodriders\n behind, followed by the rest, down the godsway. As they\nwalk, Drogo asks about the name of their son and Daenerys explains about her brother, a fierce warrior who died\nbefore she was born\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9e3d5cac281b00c9aaba27ed9611f1d3a792d6a86aceb2cb55589e51818a12d8_v2"}
