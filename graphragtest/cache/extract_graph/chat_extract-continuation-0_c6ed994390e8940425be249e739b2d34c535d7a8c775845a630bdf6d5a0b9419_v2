The children fled north. During the story, Osha adds that there are still children north of the\nWall\n, and also giants, and other old races; Maester Luwin is not happy with Osha filling the two boys with folly.\nLuwin’s tale is cut off when the two \ndirewolves\n start howling. Now Bran is sure that he knew it. The direwolves\nquiet and a bloodied messenger raven appears. Even Maester Luwin is not sure he wants to know what is in the\nmessage. Bran, hugging Rickon hard, asks about the message and Osha tells him he knows, while putting a hand\ngently on his head. Maester Luwin reads the message and tears up as he tells them that they will need to find a stone\ncarver that knew their father’s likeness well.\nNavigation:\nBran VII\n↑\nArya V\n ←\nBran VII\n→ \nSansa VI\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nBran I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 67: Sansa VI\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VI\n↑\nBran VII\n ←\nSansa VI\n→ \nDaenerys IX\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nSansa I\nSansa\n is in a depression after the execution of \nher father\n. \nJoffrey\n arrives to browbeat her into attending him in court.\nAfter court, Joffrey takes her to the ramparts to see the heads of her father and household. For a fleeting moment,\nSansa has the opportunity to push Joffrey off the wall, but it disappears too soon.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n stays in her room in \nMaegor’s Holdfast\n, sleeping, sobbing, and sleeping again. She does not eat the food the\nservants bring. When she dreams, she relives \nher father’s\n beheading. She remembers wanting to look away, but not\nbeing able to. She remembers that all the people were screaming and she remembers \nJoffrey\n smiling and feeling safe\nuntil he said those words.\nSansa believes she will be executed and the thought does not bother her; she knows songs will be sung about her.\nShe even considers throwing herself from her window, but cannot summon the courage and runs back to her bed\nsobbing. She dreams of footsteps that belong to Ser \nIlyn Payne\n coming for her with \nIce\n. In the dreams, when Ser\nIlyn is at her door she realizes she is naked, and covers herself and screams out that she will be good.\nFinally, Joffrey arrives with \nthe Hound\n and two others of the \nKingsguard\n. Joffrey throws the curtains of the bed\nopen and tells her that she will attend him in court that afternoon. Sansa begs him to leave her be, but Joffrey\nthreatens to have his Hound force her. When she does not move, he orders the Hound to get her out of bed. She\nstruggles as her blankets fall away to show that she only wears a thin bed gown. The Hound then tells her “Do as\nyou are bid, child; dress.” He pushes her to the wardrobe almost gently.\nShe tells Joffrey that she did as she was asked and now only wants to go \nhome\n. Joffrey tells her that he is still to\nmarry her, so she will stay here. She responds that she does not want to marry him because he killed her father\ndespite promising mercy. Joffrey insists he was merciful: he gave her father a clean death. Sansa now truly sees\nJoffrey for the first time, and cannot believe she ever found him handsome. Sansa whispers that she hates him.\nJoffrey tells her that his mother has said he should not strike his wife, so he orders Ser \nMeryn Trant\n to strike her\nwith the back of his gloved fist. Sansa sprawls to the floor, her ear bloody. She agrees to attend court and everyone\nbut the Hound leaves. The Hound tells her that she should save herself some pain and give Joffrey what he wants:\nshe is to smile, smell sweet, and be his lady love.\nTwo maids creep timidly into the chamber. Sansa instructs them to prepare a bath and to get powder to hide the\nbruise on her face. She is amazed at how dirty her bathwater becomes, not having washed since her father’s\nexecution. She chooses the green silk gown she wore at the \nTourney of the Hand\n when Joffery was sweet to her—\nmaybe he will remember and be gentle.\nSer Meryn escorts her to the throne room. From her observation of Ser Meryn, Sansa realizes that he feels nothing\ntowards her; she is only an object. Sansa tells Ser Meryn that he is no true knight, which she thinks the Hound would\nfind amusing, but she gets no reaction.\nShe is alone on the balcony as Joffrey dispenses what he considers justice. Mostly he lets his \nsmall council\n make the\n\ndecisions, but when he intervenes he will not be dissuaded. She sees the ugly face of \nJanos Slynt\n at the council table\nand remembers how he threw down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead. She also notices how he nods approvingly at\neach of Joffrey’s brutal judgements. She wishes some hero would cut off his head but knows there are no heroes,\nremembering \nPetyr Baelish\n telling her that life is not a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE WALL<|>GEO<|>A massive barrier in the north where children and mythical creatures like giants are said to exist)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSHA<|>PERSON<|>A character who tells stories about the north and is involved in the narrative with Bran and Rickon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER LUWIN<|>PERSON<|>A learned scholar who is skeptical of Osha's stories and reacts to a dire message)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAN<|>PERSON<|>A young boy who is aware of the direwolves' behavior and seeks answers about a message)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICKON<|>PERSON<|>Bran's younger brother who is comforted by Bran during a tense moment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>The capital city where Sansa is held and where political events unfold)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>A young woman grieving her father's execution and enduring abuse from Joffrey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>The cruel king who torments Sansa and is responsible for her father's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAEGOR’S HOLDFAST<|>GEO<|>A fortress within King's Landing where Sansa stays and is confronted by Joffrey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER ILYN PAYNE<|>PERSON<|>The executioner who beheaded Sansa's father and appears in her nightmares)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The name of Ser Ilyn Payne's sword, symbolizing his role as an executioner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HOUND<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Kingsguard who shows a rare moment of kindness to Sansa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGSGUARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The elite royal guards who serve and protect the king, including the Hound and Meryn Trant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER MERYN TRANT<|>PERSON<|>A member of the Kingsguard who strikes Sansa on Joffrey's orders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOURNEY OF THE HAND<|>EVENT<|>A tournament where Joffrey was kind to Sansa, which she recalls while preparing for court)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The advisory body to the king that makes decisions in court)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANOS SLYNT<|>PERSON<|>A member of the small council who was involved in Sansa's father's execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETYR BAEISH<|>PERSON<|>A political figure who advises Sansa about the harsh realities of life)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSHA<|>BRAN<|>Osha interacts with Bran and shares stories about the north, including the Wall<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAESTER LUWIN<|>BRAN<|>Maester Luwin is a mentor figure to Bran and reacts to the dire message<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>RICKON<|>Bran comforts Rickon during a tense moment involving the direwolves<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JOFFREY<|>Joffrey torments Sansa and is responsible for her father's execution<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>MAEGOR’S HOLDFAST<|>Sansa stays in Maegor’s Holdfast, where she is confronted by Joffrey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SER ILYN PAYNE<|>Ser Ilyn Payne executed Sansa's father and appears in her nightmares<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>THE HOUND<|>The Hound shows a rare moment of kindness to Sansa and advises her<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SER MERYN TRANT<|>Ser Meryn Trant strikes Sansa on Joffrey's orders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>TOURNEY OF THE HAND<|>Sansa recalls the Tourney of the Hand where Joffrey was kind to her<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOFFREY<|>SMALL COUNCIL<|>Joffrey relies on the small council to make decisions in court<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOFFREY<|>JANOS SLYNT<|>Janos Slynt approves of Joffrey's brutal judgments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>PETYR BAEISH<|>Petyr Baelish advises Sansa about the harsh realities of life<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
