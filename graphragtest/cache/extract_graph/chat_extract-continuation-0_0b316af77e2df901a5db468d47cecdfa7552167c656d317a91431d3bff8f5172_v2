Varys replies that\nTyrion is the wrong brother. Besides, Catelyn has let Tyrion escape and he is probably now dead in the \nMountains\nof the Moon\n.\nNed accuses Varys of standing by while his guards were slaughtered; Varys makes no apologies since he was\nunarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister soldiers. Varys continues by telling Ned that he plays his part: a\ncourageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight. Ned asks if Varys will free him, but Varys points out\nthat he would be the prime suspect. When asked if he will deliver a message, Varys admits that he will read it and\nthen decide if it serves his purpose first. When asked his purpose, Varys states that it is peace.\n\nVarys tells Ned that he struggled to keep Robert alive and protected him from his enemies for fifteen years, but\ncould not protect him from his friends. Then Varys asks what madness led Ned to tell the queen he knew the truth of\nJoffrey’s birth. Ned says it was the madness of mercy; he had hoped to save the children’s lives. Varys remarks that\nhe often forgets that Ned is one of the few honest men in the world, but when he sees the reward Ned has earned he\nunderstands why.\nNed then asks if Varys questioned \nLancel Lannister\n about the wine. Varys explains that Cersei gave Lancel the\nwineskins and told him it was the king’s favorite vintage. In any case, if it had not been the boar, it would have been\nsome other form of accident because Cersei needed to be rid of Robert to deal with his brothers: Stannis the iron\ngauntlet and Renly the silk glove. Varys then points out that Ned should have taken \nLittlefinger’s\n advice and\nsupported Joffrey. Ned is shocked that Varys knows about the offer.\nVarys then informs Ned that the queen will visit him the next day. She is frightened of him, but fears other enemies\nmore: \nJaime Lannister\n fights the \nriver lords\n, \nLysa Arryn\n is no friend, \nthe Martells\n lust for vengeance for the\nmurdered \nElia\n and her babes, and \nRobb Stark\n marches down \nthe Neck\n. Robb may only be a boy, but he is a boy with\nan army. Then there is Stannis who has a true claim to the throne, is a skilled military tactician, and is utterly\nwithout mercy. Most of all, Cersei fears that while \nher father\n battles the Starks and their allies, Stannis will descend\non King's Landing, kill her and her children, and proclaim himself king.\nHowever, Varys explains, Cersei knows “a tame wolf is more use than a dead one,” but telling her Stannis is the true\nheir will only lose Ned his head. Ned asks if he is expected to serve the woman who killed his king and crippled his\nson. Varys replies that he expects Ned to serve the realm: admit his treason, command Robb to lay down his sword,\ndenounce Stannis and Renly, and carry Cersei’s secret to the grave. Cersei knows Ned is a man of honor and will let\nhim join his \nbrother\n and his \nbastard son\n in the \nNight's Watch\n. The thought of Jon brings shame and deep sorrow to\nNed.\nNed accuses Varys of being Littlefinger’s man, but Varys denies it, saying Littlefinger is the second most devious\nman in the kingdom. Varys only feeds him choice whispers so that Littlefinger thinks he is his, just like the queen.\nNed agrees that sounds just like Varys and asks whom the eunuch truly serves. Varys replies that he serves the\nrealm, and the realm needs peace.\nWhen Varys asks what his answer will be, Ned says his life is not as precious as his honor. Varys points out that\nneither he nor the queen has forgotten about Sansa. Caught off-guard by this, Ned begs Varys to leave Sansa out of\nhis schemes, insisting his daughter is just a child. Varys notes that \nRhaenys Targaryen\n was also a child when the\nLannisters broke down her door. As he leaves he tells Ned that the next visitor can bring him either food and \nmilk of\nthe poppy\n or Sansa’s head. The choice, Varys says, is up to Ned.\nNavigation:\nEddard XIV\n↑\nSansa V\n ←\nEddard XV\n→ \nCatelyn IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 59: Catelyn IX\nPlace(s): \nThe Twins\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn VIII\n↑\nEddard XV\n ←\nCatelyn IX\n→ \nJon VIII\n↓\nCatelyn X\nRobb\n’s host arrives at \nthe Twins\n, where \nCatelyn\n negotiates their crossing of the \nGreen Fork\n with Lord \nWalder Frey\n.\nSynopsis\nCatelyn’s\n apprehensions grow as \nRobb\n’s host moves south towards \nthe Twins\n.
