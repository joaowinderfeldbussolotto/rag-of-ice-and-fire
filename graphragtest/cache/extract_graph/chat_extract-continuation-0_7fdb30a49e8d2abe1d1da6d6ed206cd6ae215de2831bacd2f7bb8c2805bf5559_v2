Pulling on her boots, she asks if anyone else heard anything.\nLommy mocks her for having wolves in her head, and Woth and \nGerren\n assure her the wolves are safely outside.\nArya insists there was a wolf, and before the others can shout her down they hear Kurz' hunting horn. In a heartbeat,\neveryone is dressing and arming themselves, while Arya rushes to the gate. As she passes the barn, \nJaqen H'ghar\ncalls out for her to free the criminals so they can fight, but she ignores him.\nClimbing the parapet, Arya glimpses hundreds of men with torches setting fire to the town. Gendry asks how many\nthere are, but they are moving too fast to count. Soon a column of riders approaches the holdfast. Arya thinks their\nbanner might be red, but the fires turn everything red, orange, or black. Reining up before the gates, a knight in a\nspiked helm demands they open it in the name of the king. \nReysen\n sarcastically asks which king, earning him a cuff\nfrom Woth.\nWhen Yoren explains that the townsfolk are gone, the knight suggests Yoren might be one of \nBeric Dondarrion\n's\nmen and \nThoros of Myr\n could be hiding with them. Yoren insists he only has some lads for the Night's Watch and\nshows his black cloak as evidence, but the knight's banner-bearer insists it could be \nHouse Dondarrion\n's purple\nlighting bolt on black. Arya now recognizes the Lannister banner and remembers that Beric Dondarrion was the man\nher father\n \nsent out\n to behead Ser \nGregor Clegane\n.\nThe knight demands they open the gate or be known as outlaws, but Yoren demands to know who is in command. A\nstout man with a manticore on his shield rides forward to introduce himself as Ser \nAmory Lorch\n, bannerman to Lord\nTywin Lannister\n, and repeat the order to open the holdfast in the name of the \ntrue\n king, \nJoffrey Baratheon\n. Yoren\nsays it does not matter to him if they burn the town, but his band are not their foes and should be left alone. Arya is\nbewildered that the raiders cannot see they are neither lords nor knights, but Gendry opines that they simply do not\ncare. Looking at Ser Amory's face the way \nSyrio Forel\n taught her, Arya realizes Gendry is right.\nSer Amory insists his men be allowed to verify Yoren's story, but Yoren senses a trick and refuses again. Lorch's\nmen mock the old recruiter, and Lorch commands a final time to open the gate. Yoren considers for a long moment\nbefore refusing again. Lorch declares them rebels, be they black brothers or not. Yoren informs Lorch that he has\nsome young boys with him, but Lorch declares they will die just the same. He gives a languid signal and a spear\nhurtles toward Yoren, but kills Woth instead. Lorch orders his men to storm the walls and kill everyone. More\nspears fly, followed by torches.\nYoren commands them to spread out and hold the walls. Arya finds herself next to Hot Pie, who panics and says he\ndoes not know how to fight. Arya lies that it is easy and pushes aside a sudden terror to scream, \"Winterfell!\" and\nhack at the first hand to appear on the parapet. Warned by Hot Pie, Arya forces the next climber back off the wall.\nFollowing her example, Hot Pie hacks the hand of a third. Ser Amory and his men have no ladders, but the walls are\nrough enough to climb, so there is no end to the foes, and each man they defeat is immediately replaced.\nArya sees Yoren drive his dirk into the knight in the spiked helm, and watches Koss shoot down four axemen\nattacking the gate. She sees the Lannister banner again and wishes Joffrey was present for her to stab. Dobber\nwrestles a man of the walk and Lommy smashes his head, yet Lommy's celebration is cut short when he sees\nDobber's body with the man's knife in his belly. She hears \nQyle\n beg for mercy until a knight with a wasp sigil\n\nsmashes his face with a spiked mace.\nThe smells of blood, smoke, iron, and piss blur together. Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie wrestle a skinny man to the\nground. Gendry breaks his sword on the man's helm, which falls off to reveal an old, frightened face. Arya feels\nsorry for the man, even as she and Hot Pie are killing him. Gendry takes the man's sword and leaps down into the\nyard, looking for foes. Arya notices more enemies have invaded the holdfast and follows Gendry, but then she is\nuncertain which way to go, since death is all around her.\nSuddenly, Yoren is shaking her. He declares that the battle is lost, and orders her to gather as many survivors as she\ncan and escape through the tunnel under the barn. Quick as that, he storms off again to rejoin the fighting. Arya\ngrabs Gendry and explains the plan. They call Hot Pie down from the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl who dreams of wolves and fights in a
