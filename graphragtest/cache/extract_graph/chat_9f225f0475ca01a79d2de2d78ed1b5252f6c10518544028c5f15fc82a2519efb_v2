Jaime and \nBrienne\n have already learned of \nRobb Stark\n’s demise, and found out that Lord\nClement Piper\n rode to King’s Landing to bend the knee since his son \nMarq\n is held captive at the \nTwins\n. When they\narrive at the \nRed Keep\n, Ser \nLoras\n confronts Brienne, accusing her of killing \nRenly\n. Jaime reminds the Knight of\nFlowers that he is his Lord Commander and orders him to sheathe his sword, but has Brienne arrested and taken to a\ntower cell.\nJaime finds Cersei in the castle \nsept\n, where \nJoffrey\n is lying in state, and shows her his stump. She asks him to kill\nTyrion\n for murdering Joffrey. Despite Cersei’s words that Tyrion threatened her when she held \nAlayaya\n prisoner,\nJaime tells her he wishes to learn more about what happened. He has sex with her on the Mother's altar, and\nafterwards Cersei calls it folly, saying that they must be more careful with their father in the castle. He responds that\nthey should stop hiding their love and wed, even if \nTommen\n would lose the \nIron Throne\n, he would still be heir to\nCasterly Rock\n, but she sends him away in anger.\nJaime then visits his father, and Lord \nTywin\n is furious when he learns that \nVargo Hoat\n maimed his son. The \nHand of\nthe King\n reveals that the \nBloody Mummers\n were routed at \nHarrenhal\n, and that \nGregor Clegane\n will kill the Goat\nsoon but is using him for amusement in the meantime. Tywin then speaks of his plans to bribe the \nHigh Septon\n to\nrelease Jaime of his vows to the Kingsguard, find a new husband for Cersei, and perhaps marry Jaime to \nMargaery\n.\nJaime vehemently refuses to hear of it, stating that he is a knight of the \nKingsguard\n, and that’s all he means to be.\nLord Tywin turns from his son in disgust, saying, \"You are not my son.
