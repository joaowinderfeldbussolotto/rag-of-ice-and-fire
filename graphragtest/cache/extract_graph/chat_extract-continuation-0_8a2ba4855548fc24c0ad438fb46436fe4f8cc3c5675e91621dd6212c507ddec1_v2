The others leave. Black Lorren counsels him to put the castle folk to the\nsword, as they will turn on them as soon as the fighting begins. Garbed for battle, Theon climbs the watchtower and\nwatches the northmen who have gathered. Despite his disapproval about the plan, Lorren goes to fetch \nBeth Cassel\n.\nAfter \nCley Cerwyn\n announces Ser Rodrik Cassel's wish to parley with Theon, Theon goes to the drawbridge. Theon\nmeets them in the market square, where Rodrik demands Theon return Winterfell to the \nStarks\n, command his men to\nlay down their weapons, and allow himself to be judged by \nRobb Stark\n. Theon gives Rodrik his own terms, telling\nthe \nknight\n that the northmen are to disperse and to swear fealthy to Balon Greyjoy as their king and Theon as the\nPrince of Winterfell. He then signals Lorren, who produces Rodrik's daughter Beth with a noose around her neck\natop the walls of Winterfell. When Rodrik accuses Theon of being craven, Theon tells him that he felt the noose for\nten years. He declines Rodrik's offer of taking his daughter's place, informing the knight that she will hang if the\nnorthern army is still present at sunset. Every following dawn and dusk, he says, another hostage will follow.\nTheon returns to the castle and retreats to \nEddard Stark\n's bedroom. He knows that the northmen will attack and that\nWinterfell will easily fall. Finding no solace in \nwine\n, Theon takes his bow to the inner ward, where he loses shafts at\narchery butts. He sees no way out: if he hangs Beth, the northern army will attack at once; But if he does not hang\nher, he will prove his threats are empty. Luwin approaches him, suggesting Theon take the black. Theon considers\nthe option, realizing it is a way to live with dignity and honor. They are interrupted by Kromm, who informs them\nthat men from the \nDreadfort\n have arrived, who are now fighting Rodrik's army.\n\nAfter the \nbattle at Winterfell\n ends, the leader of the Dreadfort men presents Theon with the corpses of Rodrik\nCassel, Cley Cerwyn, and \nLeobald Tallhart\n, and Theon orders Winterfell’s gates to be opened to their new friends.\nThe Dreadfort leader, Red Helm, informs Theon that Rodrik thought the Dreadfort men were allies to the other\nnorthmen, which allowed the Dreadfort to win the battle despite being outnumbered five-to-one. He takes off his\nhelm and Theon identifies him as Reek. The man tells Theon that Reek is dead; His name is Ramsay Snow, although\nhe prefers Ramsay Bolton. Reek had been killed while fleeing the northern soldiers who had captured Ramsay, but\nas they had exchanged clothes, no one had realized the switch of identity. Ramsay tells Theon that he was promised\na prize\n for bringing two hundred men, but brought more than promised by bringing six hundred. Instead of Palla, he\nprefers Theon's bedwarmer Kyra. When Theon objects, Ramsay punches Theon to the face and Theon falls to the\nground in pain. The Dreadfort men attack the ironborn, and Theon sees Red Rolfe, Kenned, Ulf, and Luwin die,\nwhile the roof of the stables are set aflame. Ramsay orders his men to \"save me \nthe Freys\n and burn the rest. Burn it,\nburn it all.\" The last thing Theon sees during the \nsack of Winterfell\n is his horse \nSmiler\n escaping the stables afire.\nNavigation:\nTheon V\n↑\nSansa VIII\n ←\nTheon VI\n→ \nTyrion XV\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nReek I\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 67: Tyrion XV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion XIV\n↑\nTheon VI\n ←\nTyrion XV\n→ \nJon VIII\n↓\nA Storm of Swords\nTyrion I\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n lies abed dreaming of the men who died fighting alongside him in \nthe battle\n, as well as those he killed.

Unable to speak, the maester gives him \nmilk of the poppy\n. Later,\nwhen the maester returns, Tyrion knocks the poppy from his hands and demands the cast be removed from his face.\nMaester \nBallabar\n keeps mumbling about \nthe Queen\n’s orders, but Tyrion will not listen. He demands wine not poppy,\nand looks upon his destroyed face in a mirror. Three-quarters of his nose is gone along with part of his lip, and the\nstitching job was sloppy.
