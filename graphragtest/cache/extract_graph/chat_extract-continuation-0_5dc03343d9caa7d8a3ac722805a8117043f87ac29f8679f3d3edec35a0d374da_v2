However, the\ncurrent pushed them downstream into range of the catapults of Riverrun. Many of the rafts were sunk or overturned\nand Lord Brax was drowned by his heavy plate armor. Those few who reached the far bank found the enemy waiting\nfor them. Ser \nFlement Brax\n, Lord Brax’s son, is disquieted to hear of the death of his father.\nThe camp between the rivers was overwhelmed as well. While Lord Brax was attempting to cross, two columns of\narmored horse swept in from the west led by Robb Stark himself with his \ndirewolf\n at his side. A few \nLannister\npikemen managed to hold against the first charge, but Lord \nTytos Blackwood\n led a sortie from Riverrun to take\nthem from the rear. \nGreatjon Umber\n fired the siege towers and Lord Blackwood liberated the prisoners, including\nSer \nEdmure Tully\n.\nThe south camp, under the command of Ser \nForley Prester\n, was able to retreat in good order back toward the \nGolden\nTooth\n with 2,000 spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi \nsellswords\n in his camp struck their banners and went\nover to the enemy. Kevan curses Jaime for not heeding his warning about mercenaries.\nSer Harys exclaims that all is lost. Jaime’s host is all destroyed or put to flight and the Starks and \nTullys\n now stand\nastride their supply lines, cutting Lord Tywin’s host off from their supplies and their \nhomeland\n. Robb Stark can even\nmarch on \nCasterly Rock\n if he wishes. Ser Harys insists that they must sue for peace. At that, Tyrion shatters his wine\ncup against a wall, declaring that Ser Harys will have better luck drinking from his broken cup than making peace\n\nwith Robb Stark now that \nJoffrey\n has beheaded \nEddard Stark\n.\nSer \nAddam Marbrand\n insists that two battles do not make a war, while Lord \nLeo Lefford\n suggests a truce and an\nexchange of prisoners. Tyrion only scoffs that the Starks hold far more prisoners than they do and that Eddard\nStark’s head will not get his brother Jaime back; Robb is winning. When Lefford mentions that they hold Robb’s\nsisters, Marbrand states that only an utter fool would exchange two girls for Jaime. Tyrion also shoots down\nLefford’s suggestion of a monetary ransom, declaring that the Starks can melt Jaime’s armor if they need gold. Ser\nHarys then suggests that they get their friends in the court to join them and to raise a new host at Casterly Rock.\nLord Tywin has been even quieter than usual. After reiterating that they have his son, Tywin orders everyone but\nTyrion and Kevan out.\nTyrion is going to ask for wine but his father gives him his, untouched. Lord Tywin tells Tyrion that he was right\nabout Eddard Stark: alive, Eddard could have been used to bargain a peace and buy time to deal with \nRobert’s\nbrothers. Tywin states the execution was madness and rebuffs Tyrion’s attempt to excuse Joffrey for his youth,\nthough at least Joffrey did not marry a \nwhore\n.\nLord Tywin explains that \nVarys\n has heard reports that \nRenly Baratheon\n has wed \nMargaery Tyrell\n and declared\nhimself king, with all the might of \nHighgarden\n and \nStorm's End\n behind him. Lord Tywin also informs them that\nCersei\n has commanded him to march to defend \nKing's Landing\n. Tyrion can tell that Tywin is not happy about being\ncommanded. Cersei has not told Joffrey of Renly’s claim, fearing her son will insist on leading the \nCity Watch\nagainst Renly and leave the city undefended against \nStannis Baratheon\n. Lord Tywin admits that, from the beginning,\nhe has considered Stannis the most dangerous, and yet the Lord of \nDragonstone\n has done nothing; Varys has only\nheard whisperings that Stannis is building a fleet, hiring sellswords, and seeking the counsel of a \nshadowbinder\n from\nAsshai\n.\nTywin then details their position on a map. With Jaime’s defeat, they are in a bad situation: \nRoose Bolton\n’s\nremnants are to the north, enemies hold the \nTwins\n and \nMoat Cailin\n, and Robb Stark is to the west so they cannot\nretreat to \nLannisport\n without giving battle, while Jaime’s army has ceased to exist and \nBeric Dondarrion\n and \nThoros\nof Myr\n plague their foraging parties. Then there are Dragonstone, Storm’s End, and Highgarden to the south calling\ntheir banners. Tyrion’s jest that at least \nRhaegar Targaryen\n is still dead goes unappreciated. If they remain where\nthey are they might get caught between three armies. Tywin explains that he plans to go to \nHarrenhal\n to confront\nRobb Stark. Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n will screen their movements, while \nGregor Clegane\n, \nVargo Hoat\n, and Ser \nAmory\nLorch\n with 300 men each will set fire to\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
