The \nwarg\n leads a small pack on a\nhunt. They hunt \nfree folk\n fugitives and kill them.\nAfter the kill the warg returns to his human body. He is \nVaramyr\n Sixskins and is seriously wounded. Like other free\nfolk, he had fled after \ntheir defeat\n at Castle Black. Varamyr burned when \nhis eagle\n was killed and he lost his cloaks\nand rings. After he robbed a dead woman of her cloak, her son stabbed him. His companion, Thistle, has sewn the\nwound together but it is too serious and Varamyr knows he is dying.\nHe thinks back over his youth when he was still called Lump. As a youth he had slipped into one of his father's dogs.\nThe dogs killed \nBump\n, his little brother, and Varamyr remembers his brother looking at him and knowing. Because\nhis father did not know which dog had killed Bump, he killed them all. When the last dog was killed, Lump - who\nwas in him - screamed, which made his father understand his son's ability. His parents then brought Lump to\nHaggon\n, another skinchanger. Haggon raised Lump and taught him about skinchangers, although Lump did not\nadopt his morals, particularly regarding what Haggon describes as abominations: eating the flesh of man while\ninside an animal, mating with a beast while inside one, and seizing the body of a human. When Haggon died,\nVaramyr drove him out of his wolf \nGreyskin\n to claim the wolf for himself.\nLater Varamyr adopted more animals and became Varamyr Sixskins. He established himself as a kind of lord, taking\ntribute in food and using his animals to bring him women from nearby villages.\nVaramyr wakes up from his memories when Thistle returns. As he knows that his body is dying, he turns on his\ncompanion to take over her body. She struggles and eventually manages to escape his control. As he dies, he half\nregrets trying to take over Thistle's body, but also half regrets failing at that. He awakens in the body of one of his\nwolves. Later his pack discovers Thistle. Frozen blood clings to her - she has become a \nwight\n. As her blue eyes stare\ninto his wolf eyes he knows she sees him ...\nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nTyrion I\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 1: Tyrion I\nPlace(s): \nthe \nNarrow Sea\n - \nPentos\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion XI\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nPrologue\n ←\nTyrion I\n→ \nDaenerys I\n↓\nTyrion II\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n is in the cabin of a ship fleeing across the \nnarrow sea\n, perpetually drunk and wracked with guilt over his\nbetrayal of the \nLannisters\n and murder of \nhis father\n, as well as his anxiety over the fate of \nTysha\n, whom he now\nknows to be the only woman ever to have truly loved him.\nHaving escaped and found passage across the sea thanks to \nVarys\n, he ponders where he might be going. He decides\nhe would prefer to go to \nDorne\n so he can raise his niece \nMyrcella\n to the \nIron Throne\n.

He discovers \na\npatch of poisonous mushrooms\n and picks them before passing out. He meets a courtesan of Illyrio's who has been\nassigned to him, threatening her before heading off to dinner with the Magister.\nHe is eventually served a dish of mushrooms and contemplates whether Illyrio is trying to poison him, and whether\nit would not be best just to eat some and be done with it. Illyrio goads him before eating some of the mushrooms\nhimself and asking Tyrion of his intentions. He informs Tyrion that \nStannis\n is at the \nWall\n, and says that neither\nStannis at the Wall nor Myrcella in Dorne is a viable candidate for support in the game of thrones. Mopatis claims\nthat Westeros is in need of a savior from across the sea.
