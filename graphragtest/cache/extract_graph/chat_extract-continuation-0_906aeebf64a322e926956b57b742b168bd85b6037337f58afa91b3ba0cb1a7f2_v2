Now the knight’s parries begin to grow slower and lower and Bronn attacks with more\nenergy. Blind to the fact that Ser Vardis is losing, Lysa calls for him to finish the sellsword as if he were delaying\nthe end on purpose. The knight charges and Bronn almost loses his balance but manages to jump back from the blow\nand push a statue onto the knight. With Ser Vardis pinned under the fallen statue, Bronn delivers the killing blow\nand a silence falls over the crowd.\nRobert asks if it is over, and Lysa is forced to admit it is. Robert then asks if he can make the little man fly and\nTyrion joyfully says, “Not this little man.” When Lysa makes a thinly veiled threat to execute Tyrion anyway, the\ndwarf asks if Lysa remembers \nHouse Arryn\n’s words: “As High as Honor.” Robert insists that he wants to make\nTyrion fly, but Lysa is forced to admit that the gods have proclaimed Tyrion innocent. She orders Tyrion and Bronn\nescorted to the \nBloody Gate\n and provided with supplies, but they must take the high road alone. Everyone in the\ncourt recognizes the proclamation as another sort of death sentence. Tyrion favors Lysa with a mocking bow, saying\nhe and Bronn already know the way.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn VI\n↑\nEddard X\n ←\nCatelyn VII\n→ \nJon V\n↓\nCatelyn VIII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 41: Jon V\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon IV\n↑\nCatelyn VII\n ←\nJon V\n→ \nTyrion VI\n↓\nJon VI\nSer \nAlliser\n announces that he is passing eight recruits, including \nJon\n. There is a celebration, but Jon realizes that\nSam\n will not survive without the others to protect him. Jon asks \nMaester\n \nAemon\n to allow Sam to become his\nsteward since he can read, write, and do sums.\nSynopsis\nFive new recruits are being marched up the \nkingsroad\n, so Ser \nAlliser\n is passing eight boys on to the \nLord\nCommander\n: \nTodder\n, \nHalder\n, \nGrenn\n, \nDareon\n, \nAlbett\n, \nPypar\n, \nMatthar\n, and \nJon\n. He then tells the boys that some will\nnow call them men, but they are fools to believe it and when winter comes they will die like flies. Then Ser Alliser\nleaves.\nThe recruits gather around and offer congratulations to those promoted. As the boys pass a celebratory wineskin\naround, Jon notices \nSam\n standing by himself and goes over to him. Sam proclaims that Jon will be first ranger\nsomeday, like \nhis uncle\n “was.” Jon corrects this to “is.” Halder interrupts to ask if Jon is going to drink the wine he\nis carrying. Then Pyp grabs the wineskin, and squirts it into Jon’s face. Soon the ecstatic boys start a snowball fight\nand by the time Jon can break free, Sam has disappeared.\nThe promoted boys are treated to a marvelous feast that night to celebrate. The group discusses and jokes about their\nassignments: ranger, builder, woodsman, steward. They are all convinced that Jon, as the best swordsman and rider,\nwill be a ranger, like his uncle “was” the First Ranger. Jon corrects this to “is” once again before pushing his food\naway and leaving. Pyp follows and asks what is wrong. Jon explains that it is because Sam is not with them. Without\nthem to protect him, Sam will be at the mercy of Ser Alliser. Pyp assures Jon that they did all they could for Sam,\nbut that is not good enough for Jon. Jon goes for a long ride by himself.\nAs he rides he thinks about the world outside the \nNight's Watch\n and reminds himself that he has not yet sworn his\nvow. He thinks of all the places he has wanted to travel to and will never visit. He longs to go back to \nWinterfell\n to\nbe with his half-brothers, but then remembers that Lady \nCatelyn\n will not welcome him. Jon decides that there is no\nplace for him in Winterfell or \nKing's Landing\n, and remembers that not even his mother had a place for him.\nWhoever she was, his mother must be something dishonorable, otherwise why would Lord \nEddard\n be too ashamed\nto speak of her? On the ride back Jon thinks about what he should do about Sam.\nJon visits \nMaester\n \nAemon\n despite the late hour. Aemon’s stewards, \nChett\n and \nClydas\n, considered the ugliest men in\nthe Watch, meet him at the door. Chett insists that the maester is asleep and orders Jon to come back in the morning.\nJon puts his foot in the door to prevent it closing, and refuses to leave since tomorrow will be too late. Chett goes to\nget the maester, while Jon goes to the library and starts a fire as instructed.\nWhen Maester Aemon arrives, he sits by the fire and assures Jon that a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion from\nthe sleeplessness of old age. Jon asks that Sam be accepted as a sworn brother along with the others. Chett\ncomplains that it is no concern of the maester and Maester Aemon agrees that training is the responsibility of Ser\nAlliser.
