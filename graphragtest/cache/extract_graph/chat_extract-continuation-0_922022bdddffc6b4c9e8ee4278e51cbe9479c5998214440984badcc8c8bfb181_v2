Jon denies that his father could ever be a traitor, but then recalls that he fathered a bastard; where was\nthe honor in that? The Lord Commander explains that he plans to use his contacts in \nKing's Landing\n to ensure that\nEddard is allowed to take the black; they could use men of Eddard’s ability on the Wall. Jon thinks that it would be a\nterrible injustice to strip his father of \nWinterfell\n but knows it would be preferable to death. Then he remembers\nJoffrey mocking \nRobb Stark\n and Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, and asks if the king will listen. Mormont replies that Joffrey\nmay listen to \nhis mother\n, though it is too bad \nTyrion Lannister\n is not there. Mormont declares it a bad thing that\nJon’s “mother” took Tyrion captive, but Jon haughtily reminds him that \nCatelyn Stark\n is not his mother. Jon then\nasks about his sisters and Mormont promises to ask about them. Then Mormont states that he hopes Jon is not going\nto do anything stupid; his duty is now here and his old life ended when he took the black. He then dismisses Jon,\ntelling him that he can help write the letter the next day.\nDespite Mormont’s words, Jon remains convinced the Starks are his family and wonders how it cannot be his\nconcern. He also wonders whether his father could truly be a traitor. At the evening meal Jon realizes that everyone\nknows about his father’s arrest. When his friends rally to him and assure him that they do not believe the stories, Jon\nrealizes that they are now his brothers as much as Robb and \nBran\n and \nRickon\n. Then Jon hears Ser \nAlliser\n mocking\nboth Jon and his father. In the blink of an eye, Jon jumps over the table and attacks Ser Alliser with a knife, but his\nfriends hold him back and he is marched to his sleeping cell. Later, Mormont visits him and reminds Jon that he told\nhim not to do anything stupid. Now the high officers must meet to decide his fate. A guard is left at his door, and his\nfriends are not permitted to visit him, though Ghost is allowed to stay.\nThat night, Jon wakes to Ghost scratching at the door, and it is very cold. When he opens his door, Jon finds his door\nguard dead and he hears noises coming from the Lord Commander’s chamber. Taking the dead guard’s sword, Jon\nascends to the Lord Commander's chamber where he finds the door open and \nMormont's raven\n squawking. He sees\nthe shadow of a man in black with icy blue eyes going into the Lord Commander’s sleeping chamber.\nGhost attacks the man, and Jon pulls down the curtains so that he can see. The man has his black hands around\nGhost’s throat. Jon cuts off an arm with his sword and Ghost is able to wrench free. The next stroke cuts halfway\n\nthrough the man’s face, and now Jon recognizes Othor. The severed hand claws at his calf and Jon pulls it off. Ghost\nattacks the hand while Jon strikes the undead man in the neck, but Othor slams into him, knocking him down. In the\nfall, Jon loses his sword. Othor is on top of Jon and attempting to choke him, but is finally pulled off by Ghost. As\nhe regains his feet, Jon spots the Lord Commander standing naked in the doorway with an oil lamp as the hand\napproaches him. Jon grabs the oil lamp from the Lord Commander and throws it on the drapes, setting them afire.\nThen Jon grabs the burning drapes and throws them onto Othor, praying that the \nwight\n will burn.\nNavigation:\nJon VI\n↑\nSansa IV\n ←\nJon VII\n→ \nBran VI\n↓\nJon VIII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 53: Bran VI\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran V\n↑\nJon VII\n ←\nBran VI\n→ \nDaenerys VI\n↓\nBran VII\nBran\n watches the \nKarstarks\n arrive, then goes to the \ngodswood\n to pray.

Then Robb marches his army south.\nSynopsis\nBran\n watches from a guard turret with \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n’s fareye as the \nKarstark\n forces arrive at \nWinterfell\n. When\nRobb\n heard the news that \ntheir father\n had been taken captive in \nKing's Landing\n, he called the Stark bannermen\ntogether for war. The Karstarks are the last to arrive: three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot lead by\nLord \nRickard Karstark\n with his sons \nHarrion\n, \nEddard\n, and \nTorrhen\n riding beside him. The Karstarks are said to have\nStark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but the fierce men do not look like Starks to Bran.\nBran has not been allowed to leave the castle since the \nincident\n in the \nwolfswood\n.
