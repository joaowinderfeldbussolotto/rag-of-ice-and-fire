He urges Robb to march on Lord Tywin at \nHarrenhal\n, but Robb insists he does not have the strength.\nEdmure points out that they only grow weaker sitting here.\nCatelyn snaps that it was Edmure's idea to permit the river lords to depart for their own lands. Edmure argues that he\ncannot command his lords to remain idle while their crops are burnt and their people killed, but it would be an ill\nthing if a northman like Lord Rickard left them. Robb agrees to speak with Lord Rickard, but he cannot blame the\nman for loathing peace with \nhis\n \nsons\n' killers. Catelyn points out that more bloodshed will not bring back the dead.\nShe suggests a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms, but Robb declares that sweeter terms would have\ngagged him. Catelyn realizes that her son wants vengeance as much as Lord Rickard.\nCatelyn points out that Cersei will never trade Sansa and \nArya\n for a pair of cousins when what she wants is her\nbrother Jaime. Robb explains that his bannermen will never allow him to release the Kingslayer, even if he wanted\nto. Catelyn says the lords made Robb their king, but Robb replies that they can unmake him just as easy. Catelyn\nargues that the safe return of the girls is worth Robb's crown, fearing for her daughters if something bad should\nbefall Jaime in their custody. Robb assures her that no one sees Jaime without his warrant.\nCatelyn asks if Robb is afraid to face Jaime in the field again. Edmure sides with Robb, but accidentally refers to\nhim as \"the boy.\" Robb roars at Edmure not to call him a boy and declares he can defeat Jaime again if he must. He\nadmits he would have traded Jaime for his father, but looks hurt when Catelyn presses him to say whether the girls\nare important enough. Catelyn realizes that Robb is doing his best, yet she cannot bear the thought of losing her\ndaughters as well as her husband. Robb promises that if Cersei refuses peace he will do all he can for his sisters by\nmaking her rue the decision.\nCatelyn can sense Robb is tired of the subject. He asks her to go to \nthe Twins\n to meet Lord \nWalder Frey\n's daughters\nand help choose his future bride. Catelyn sees this as an excuse to send her away for saying things Robb does not\nwant to hear, so she tells Robb he is old enough to choose for himself. Next, Robb urges her to accompany \nTheon\nGreyjoy\n and the \nMallisters\n to \nSeagard\n, and return by ship to Winterfell to be with \nBran\n and \nRickon\n. Catelyn insists\nthat until her father dies her place is at Riverrun.\nRobb mentions that he could command her to go, but Catelyn counters by asking Robb to reconsider sending Theon\n\nas his envoy to \nPyke\n. Robb asks who would be better to negotiate with Lord \nBalon Greyjoy\n than his son. Catelyn\ninsists that \nanyone\n would be better. Robb argues that Theon fought bravely for them and they have need of his\nfather's longships. Catelyn replies that they will get the ships sooner if Theon remains a hostage. She also insists\nBalon is not trustworthy and may aspire to wear a crown \nagain\n himself. Robb declares he will gladly give Balon a\ncrown if it helps defeat the Lannisters. Before Catelyn can reply, Robb walks off and Catelyn can only watch him\ngo, remembering back at \nMoat Cailin\n when she urged him to command as he does now.\nCatelyn asks Edmure to join her in father's sickroom, but he begs off to speak with some new recruits. On her way to\nthe central keep, Catelyn shortcuts through the \ngodswood\n, where the leaves still rustle on the trees, ignorant of the\nwhite raven\n that has proclaimed the arrival of autumn. Catelyn is thankful that the weather is holding, since autumn\nis a fearful time when even the wisest never know if the next harvest will be the last.\nShe finds Lord \nHoster Tully\n sleeping in his solar, made frail by the death growing within him. Beside the bed sits\nher uncle, Ser \nBynden the Blackfish\n. When Catelyn asks if Robb knows of his return, the Blackfish says he did not\ninterrupt the court because Robb will want to hear his news in private first. When her uncle asks about her father,\nCatelyn confesses that he grows weaker every day, and sometimes his mind is unclear. The Blackfish admits that he\nalways wonders if his brother will be dead upon his return. Catelyn comforts him that at least he made his peace\nwith her father.\nThey sit silently for a long time before Catelyn asks for the Blackfish's tidings. To avoid waking her father, they\nadjourn to the balcony. Her uncle comments that the \nred comet\n is now visible by day, and says his men call it the\n“Red Messenger,” though he wonders what the message is. Catelyn says the Greatjon claims it is a red flag of\nvengeance for her husband, while Edmure claims it is a victory omen: a fish in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f67e65c355b15f37497b9de418ffdc6218994e86c730b1c3d4c20f9e8c752295_v2"}
