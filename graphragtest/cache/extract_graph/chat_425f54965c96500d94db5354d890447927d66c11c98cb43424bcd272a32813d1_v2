He dismisses the idea, warning that reneging on\nMyrcella's betrothal now could be all the cause \nDoran Martell\n needs to side with Connington. Harys Swyft suggests\nthat they get the Dornish to deal with Connington and his pretender; Kevan agrees that it would save them a lot of\ntrouble. After Tyrell and Tarly are gone, Pycelle asks Kevan for guards, fearing that Mace Tyrell means to do him\nharm for his part in Cersei's claims about Margaery, but Kevan dismisses his concerns.\nIt is snowing heavily in King's Landing and Kevan retires to his study for a time to warm up. He muses on the\npossibility of raising his son \nLancel\n to the Kingsguard to end his newfound piety, before his thoughts turn to Cersei,\nthe charming and sweet girl once was; he believes that, had Aerys accepted Tywin's offer and wed his son to Cersei,\nRhaegar\n would never have looked twice at \nLyanna Stark\n, and perhaps many now dead would still be alive. He then\nthinks on Cersei's \nwalk of shame\n and how similar it was to what Tywin did to their \nfather's\n \nmistress\n, but Kevan\nreassures himself it was necessary; the Faith had to be appeased, and left unchecked, Cersei would have corrupted\nTommen as she did \nJoffrey\n.\nKevan then goes to Cersei's chambers, where he has dinner with her and Tommen. Cersei is very calm and guarded\nafter her walk of atonement, which Kevan thinks a good sign. She makes a humble request that \nTaena Merryweather\nattend on her once more after the trial and that her son be brought to court as a companion for Tommen; she also\nasks after her brothers, but Kevan has no news of Jaime or Tyrion. He also says that he has imprisoned the\nremaining Kettleblack brothers for their crimes of fornicating with a Queen; if they confess, he will send them to the\nWall. If not, they will face Robert Strong.\nA messenger then announces that Grand Maester Pycelle is asking for Kevan's presence. Kevan arrives at the\nMaester's chambers and enters to find a \nwhite raven\n sitting on the window ledge, a sign from the \nCitadel\n that winter\nhas come. Kevan turns to leave, and is hit in the chest by a crossbow bolt. He calls out for help, but then sees Pycelle\nsat at his table, already dead. For one moment, Kevan calls out to \nTyrion\n, thinking his nephew responsible, but a\nfamiliar voice tells him otherwise as the real killer emerges: \nVarys\n. Varys explains to the dying Kevan that he bears\nthe man no ill will, that Kevan is simply a good man in service to a bad cause, but he was becoming too successful\nin uniting the realm behind Tommen and undoing the damage Cersei had caused. The eunuch adds that Cersei will\nsuspect the Tyrells (with help from the Imp) for Kevan's murder, the Tyrells will blame her, someone will blame the\nDornish and the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the \nIron Throne\n will crumble as \nAegon\n makes his presence\nknown at Storm's End and the realm flocks to the side of the Targaryens.\nKevan insists that Aegon was killed during the \nSack of King's Landing\n but Varys explains otherwise; that Aegon has\nbeen groomed since birth to be king, taught not just in skill at arms and ruling, but how to look after himself, what it\nmeans to go hungry, to be hunted and most importantly, that it is his \nduty\n to rule, not his right, and to put his people\nfirst. Varys then summons some of his \"\nlittle birds\n\" and instructs them to finish the dying Kevan off.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys X\n ←\nEpilogue\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_425f54965c96500d94db5354d890447927d66c11c98cb43424bcd272a32813d1_v2"}
