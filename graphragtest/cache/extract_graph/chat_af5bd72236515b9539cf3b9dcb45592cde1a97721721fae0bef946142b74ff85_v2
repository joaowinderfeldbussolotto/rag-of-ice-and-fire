Ned called it\nmurder but Robert called it war. It took the death of \nLyanna\n to reconcile them again.\nThis time Ned keeps his temper, telling Robert that he is no Tywin Lannister to slaughter innocents. Robert angrily\ninsists that Daenerys will not remain an innocent forever and will soon breed more “dragonspawn” to plague him.\nWhen Ned reiterates that killing a child would be unspeakable, Robert responds that what \nAerys\n did to Ned’s \nfather\nand \nbrother\n and what Rhaegar did to Lyanna were unspeakable.\nWhen Robert mentions that Drogo has 100,000 men in his \nhorde\n, Ned insists that even a million \nDothraki\n are no\nthreat to the realm without ships. Robert replies that ships can be found in the \nFree Cities\n and that many in the \nSeven\nKingdoms\n—particularly in \nDorne\n and \nthe Reach\n—would not hesitate to join a Targaryen invasion. Despite this, Ned\nremains convinced that they would be able to drive the Dothraki back, emphasizing the importance of appointing a\nnew \nWarden of the East\n. When Robert refuses to appoint \nJon Arryn\n’s son \nRobert\n, Ned suggests the king’s own\nbrother, \nStannis\n. When Robert continues to be evasive, Ned quickly deduces that he has already promised the office\nto \nJaime Lannister\n. Ned reminds Robert that Jaime already stands to succeed Tywin Lannister as \nWarden of the\nWest\n and that as Warden of both East and West, Jaime would control half of all the realm’s armies.\n\nNed asks whether Jaime can be trusted. When Robert asks why he shouldn’t trust Jaime, Ned reminds him that\nJaime betrayed and killed the last king he was sworn to protect. To illustrate his point about Jaime Lannister, Ned\ndescribes to Robert how, after the \nBattle of the Trident\n, he followed Rhaegar's army back to King's Landing to find\nthe city \nsacked\n by the Lannisters. Ned goes on to explain that upon entering the throne room, he found King Aerys\ndead on the floor and Jaime sitting on the \nIron Throne\n. Although Jaime eventually rose to say that he was only\nkeeping the uncomfortable thing warm for Robert, Ned insists that Jaime had no right to sit the throne.\nRobert finds this amusing and does not consider Jaime's \"great sin\" to be that bad. He gallops off but Ned pauses,\ndespairing of ever keeping Robert from making mistakes. He still believes he should be in Winterfell with his wife\nand \nBran\n. Finally, resigned to not being able to be where he belongs, Ned follows his king.\nNavigation:\nEddard I\n↑\nDaenerys II\n ←\nEddard II\n→ \nTyrion II\n↓\nEddard III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 13: Tyrion II\nPlace(s): \nNorth of \nWinterfell\n on the way to \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion I\n↑\nEddard II\n ←\nTyrion II\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nTyrion III\nAs they travel north \nTyrion\n and \nJon Snow\n argue about the realities of life on the \nWall\n.\nSynopsis\nAfter a fortnight riding north from \nWinterfell\n with \nBenjen Stark\n, \nJon Snow\n, and two of his own retainers, \nTyrion\n is\namazed by the enormous size of \nthe North\n. Although he knows the maps of the region as well as anyone, the land\nitself is quite another thing. It has grown colder, quieter, and far lonelier the farther north they go and the Kingsroad\nhas narrowed to a wild track.\nThree days out of Winterfell the farmland has given way to the dense, dark forests of the \nWolfswood\n. There they\nmeet up with \nYoren\n, a brother of the \nNight's Watch\n, accompanied by two peasant boys condemned to join the\nWatch. That night Tyrion notices Jon Snow looking at their new companions with dismay and feels sorry for the boy\nwho has had such a hard life chosen for him. Tyrion feels less sympathy for Benjen Stark, who apparently shares his\nbrother\n’s distaste for Lannisters and seems intent on making Tyrion’s journey north as uncomfortable as possible.\nHowever, Tyrion does take a small bit of revenge when he accepts a tattered old bearskin cloak from Benjen, a gift\nTyrion thinks Benjen did not expect him to accept and is probably regretting.\nBy the eighteenth night of their journey the inns and settlements have long since disappeared, forcing the party to\nmake camp. Being too small to help, Tyrion (as is his custom) goes away from the camp with a book about \ndragons\n,\none of several brought with him from Winterfell. Tyrion has always been interested in dragons. He remembers\nseeking out the dragon skulls in \nKing's Landing\n the first time he was there. He recalls having a torch with him when\nhe discovered the skulls and having the sensation that they seemed to like\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_af5bd72236515b9539cf3b9dcb45592cde1a97721721fae0bef946142b74ff85_v2"}
