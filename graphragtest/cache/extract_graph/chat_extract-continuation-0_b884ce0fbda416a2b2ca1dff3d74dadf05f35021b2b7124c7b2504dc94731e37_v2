Ned is\ndiscomforted by the news, since he had remained hopeful of Renly’s support.\nNed entrusts Ser \nBarristan\n to read the writ naming him Protector of the Realm until the heir comes of age. Ned\nthinks to himself that the \ntrue heir\n is already of age, but says nothing; he does not trust Varys or Pycelle and Ser\nBarristan is honor bound to protect the boy he thinks is his rightful king. The need for deceit bothers him, but Ned\nknows he must keep Cersei’s secret until he is firmly established as regent. There will be plenty of time to deal with\nthe succession when his daughters are safe and Stannis has arrived with his forces. Ned asks the council to proclaim\nhim Protector of the Realm as Robert wished. Before anyone can reply, the meeting is interrupted by \nFat Tom\n and\nthe royal steward with news that the king demands the small council’s immediate presence in the throne room. Ned\nis unsurprised that Cersei would strike quickly, and orders Tom to assemble an escort.\nEscorted by eight men-at-arms and supported by Littlefinger, Ned makes his way across the yard, reassured by the\nnumber of Stark guardsmen on the walls. Inside the throne room, Joffrey sits the \nIron Throne\n with Cersei and his\nsiblings below, guarded by \nSandor Clegane\n and all of the \nKingsguard\n except \nJaime Lannister\n and Ser Barristan, who\nhas just arrived with Ned. Behind the throne stand twenty Lannister guardsmen armed with swords, and along the\nwalls are a hundred \ngold cloaks\n armed with spears, enough to outnumber the Lannisters five to one. At the sight of\nthe gold cloaks, Ned is encouraged that Littlefinger has kept his promise.\n\nJoffrey stands and commands that the council make arrangements for his coronation which he wishes held within the\nfortnight. The young king then declares that today he will accept oaths of fealty from his loyal councilors. Ned has\nVarys deliver Robert’s will to Cersei. The queen glances at the words then tears it up, questioning if Ned meant a\npiece of paper to be his shield. The honorable Ser Barristan exclaims that those were the king’s words, but Cersei\ndismissively declares that they have a new king now. Then Cersei advises Ned that if he bends the knee and swears\nfealty to Joffrey he will be allowed to retire peacefully to Winterfell. Instead, bound by his honor, Ned declares that\nJoffrey has no right to the throne and that \nStannis\n is the true heir.\nJoffrey bursts out in anger and Cersei orders Ser Barristan to seize Ned as a traitor. The old knight hesitates and is\nquickly surrounded by Ned’s guardsmen. At Cersei’s command, the Hound and the Lannister guardsmen draw their\nswords to aid in the arrest. Ned responds by ordering \nJanos Slynt\n to have his gold cloaks take the queen and her\nchildren into custody. As Ned is stating he wants no bloodshed, a gold cloak shoves a spear through Tomard’s back.\nA brief fight ensues, quickly killing all of Ned’s guardsmen. As Ned’s men die around him, Littlefinger slides Ned’s\ndagger from its sheath, holds it to his throat, and says,\n\"I did warn you not to trust me, you know.\"\nNavigation:\nEddard XIII\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nEddard XIV\n→ \nArya IV\n↓\nEddard XV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 50: Arya IV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya III\n↑\nEddard XIV\n ←\nArya IV\n→ \nSansa IV\n↓\nArya V\nArya\n’s training with \nSyrio Forel\n is interrupted by Ser \nMeryn Trant\n and a party of \nLannister guardsmen\n. When\nMeryn demands Arya come with him, Syrio senses something odd and fights the guards, giving Arya time to escape.\nAt the stables Arya finds her sword \nNeedle\n and kills a stable boy who attempts to capture her before escaping via the\ndungeons of the \nRed Keep\n.\nSynopsis\nArya\n is training with \nSyrio Forel\n in the Small Hall before they are due to board ship for \nWinterfell\n. Syrio calls his\nstrikes and Arya blocks each in turn until one hits her breast from the wrong side and Syrio says she is dead. Arya\ncomplains that Syrio cheated by lying. The swordsman says only his words lied, not his eyes or his arm, but she was\nnot seeing. Arya insists that she watched him every second, but Syrio declares that watching is not seeing. To\nillustrate his point, Syrio tells her how he became the \nFirst Sword of Braavos\n.\nSyrio explains that there were many who were stronger, faster, or younger, but he was the best because he could see\nthe truth. After the death of the previous First Sword, many \nbravos\n were called to the \nSealord\n and as many were sent\naway.
