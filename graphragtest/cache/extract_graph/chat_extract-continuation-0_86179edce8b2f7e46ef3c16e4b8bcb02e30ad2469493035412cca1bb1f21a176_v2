Esgred admits that Euron may be dead and that if he is alive he would be half a\nstranger, which would make it unlikely that the ironborn would seat him on the \nSeastone Chair\n. Theon is bothered\nby the thought, as his absence of ten years has made him more of a stranger than Euron. Regardless, he is\ndetermined to prove himself worthy.\n\nDuring the remainder of the journey they speak of the feast, \nTheon's mother\n, who resides at \nHarlaw\n, and Esgred's\npregnancy. She eventually asks about \nRobb Stark\n and his war against the \nLannisters\n, and Theon tells her about the\nbattles they have fought. As they arrive at Pyke, however, Theon discovers to his horror that Esgred is actually Asha\nwhen the stableboy addresses her by her name. Asha reveals she arrived with Lord Goodbrother the night before and\nhad stayed a night at the inn. As Theon gapes at her, she tells him that kept silent about her identity because she\nwanted to see who he was first. Asha leaves and Theon takes his anger out on Wex, who is smirking at him. Theon\nretreats to his chambers, angry, thinking how Asha made a fool of him and how he has no place at Pyke because of\nher. When he hears the distant music he dresses for Balon's feast, deciding to wear only plain clothes while cursing\nthe fact that he has no ornaments \"bought with iron\".\nAt the hall Lord Balon is feasting near four hundred lords and captains. All the houses of the Iron Islands are present\nexcept for \nHouse Stonehouse\n and \nHouse Drumm\n, who have yet to arrive. At the dais, Balon comments that Theon is\nlate. Theon sits down next to Asha, who is siting at Balon's right in a place of high honor. When Theon hisses to her\nthat she is in his seat, she replies that his place is at \nWinterfell\n and asks where his pretty clothes are. When Theon\nasks if every word she told him was a lie, she says not. Calling out to one of the dancers, \nRolfe\n, Asha catches a\nflying axe\n and splits Theon’s trencher with it, telling him the axe is her husband. She then pulls a dirk from between\nher breasts and tells him it is her suckling babe. Theon realizes the entire hall is laughing at him. As Asha sits back\ndown, she tells him he should learn about the isles and the people on them, asking him why they should die for\nTheon if he does not know them. Theon insists he is their prince, but Asha counters that the ironborn do not follow\nthe laws of the green lands, but rather make their own.\nFinally Lord Balon rises, telling them to join him in his solar when they are finished. After arguing with Asha,\nTheon leaves and crosses the rope bridge to the \nSea Tower\n, where he finds his father and two uncles, Victarion and\nAeron\n, in the damp, drafty solar. On seeing him, Balon tells him it is time he heard his plans, refusing to hear any of\nTheon's suggestions. He tells Theon that he will command eight ships to \nharrying of the Stony Shore\n, accompanied\nby Aeron and \nDagmer\n. Theon feels slapped, feeling the work is beneath him and that the inclusion of Aeron and\nDagmer indicates that Balon does not trust him. As Asha slips in, Balon tells them that she will take thirty ships with\npicked men to take \nDeepwood Motte\n. Victarion is to make the main thrust at \nMoat Cailin\n, sailing up the \nSaltspear\nand the \nFever River\n. Once they hold Moat Cailin Robb Stark will not be able to return north. Theon tries to tell\nBalon that the lords hold the castles, but again Balon shuts him up, saying the lords have gone south with Robb.\nWinterfell may hold out for a year, but the rest shall be theirs.\nTheon leaves the solar, but on the rope bridge a sudden gust of wind causes him to stumble to his knees. Asha is\nsuddenly there and helps him back up, guiding him across the rest of the bridge. She comments he cannot hold his\nwine either. Theon tells her he liked her better as Esgred, and she tells him she liked him better when he was nine.\nNavigation:\nTheon I\n↑\nJon III\n ←\nTheon II\n→ \nTyrion VI\n↓\nTheon III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 25: Tyrion VI\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nTheon II\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nArya VI\n↓\nTyrion VII\nTyrion\n delivers the news to \nCersei\n that \nStannis Baratheon\n and \nRenly Baratheon\n are confronting each other, using the\nopportunity to poison Cersei so she cannot interfere with his actions.
