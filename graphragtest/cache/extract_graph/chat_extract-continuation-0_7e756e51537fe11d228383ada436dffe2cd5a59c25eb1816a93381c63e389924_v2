When the \nsmall council\n also sides against him,\nNed resigns in protest. As Ned prepares to return to \nWinterfell\n, \nLittlefinger\n arrives with news that he has identified\nthe \nbrothel\n that \nJon Arryn\n and \nStannis Baratheon\n visited.\nSynopsis\nNed\n is trying to dissuade King \nRobert\n from sending men to kill \nDaenerys Targaryen\n, now that \nVarys\n has received\nreports of her pregnancy. Robert wants every \nTargaryen\n dead and grows very angry with Ned’s resistance. Ned\ninsists that even if the report is true a lot can happen before the child is old enough to be a threat; the mother might\nmiscarry, or the child might be born female or die in infancy. Ned also proclaims that he will only fear the \nDothraki\nwhen they teach their horses to run on water.\nRenly\n comments that it was a mistake to allow \nViserys\n and Daenerys to live this long. Ned insists that mercy is\nnever a mistake, pointing out that at the \nBattle of the Trident\n Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n slew a dozen friends of both Ned\nand Robert, yet Robert absolved him and appointed him \nLord Commander of the Kingsguard\n. Robert insists that it is\nnot the same; Ser Barristan was a knight of the \nKingsguard\n. Ned counters that Daenerys is a 14-year-old girl and\nasks why they overthrew \nHouse Targaryen\n if not to end the murder of children. Robert growls that it was to put an\nend to Targaryens.\nWhen Ned questions how a man who never feared \nRhaegar Targaryen\n can tremble at the shadow of an unborn child,\nKing Robert bellows that he has heard enough and asks for a vote. The other councilors all side with the king except\nfor Ser Barristan who states that there is no honor in killing an enemy in his mother’s womb.\nWith the decision made, Robert turns to the topic of how best to carry out the assassination. Renly suggests that Ser\nJorah Mormont\n, who craves a royal pardon, might be of use. Varys reminds them all that Ser Jorah is unlikely to risk\nthe punishment the Dothraki would inflict on the murderer of a \nkhaleesi\n. Instead, the eunuch proposes the alternative\nof \npoison\n, such as the \nTears of Lys\n; \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n need never know it was not a natural death.\nThe mention of the Tears of Lys seems to awaken Grand \nMaester\n \nPycelle\n from his drowsiness and Robert\ndenounces poison as a coward’s weapon. Ned remarks on the hypocrisy of debating an honorable way to assassinate\na 14-year-old and declares that Robert should do the killing himself, the honorable way among the \nFirst Men\n. Robert\nis astounded when he realizes that Ned actually means what he has just said.\nNed refuses to participate further, declaring that Robert can do as he likes but that he will have no part of it. Robert\ndeclares that, as \nHand\n, Ned will do as commanded or be replaced by a Hand who will. Ned wishes luck to his\nreplacement and removes his badge of office, declaring that he thought Robert was a better man. As Ned marches\naway, the king calls after him that he will have Ned’s head on a spike if he ever sees him again. Before Ned has\neven left, the council resumes the discussion and Ned overhears Pycelle telling the others of a society of assassins in\nBraavos\n called the \nFaceless Men\n. Littlefinger counters that they can hire an army of \nsellswords\n for a fraction of the\nprice.\nNed returns to the \nTower of the Hand\n and summons \nVayon Poole\n to discuss arrangements for their return to\n\nWinterfell\n. Ned is disturbed that Robert still hates the long dead Rhaegar Targaryen so much. Then Ned thinks about\nwhat will happen when the king discovers that \nCatelyn\n has taken \nTyrion Lannister\n captive. The king may not care\nfor the Imp, but it will hurt his pride, and \nCersei\n will whisper in his ear. With these thoughts, Ned decides that it\nmight be safest if he and the girls go ahead, and the rest can follow.\nAfter Poole leaves, Ned reflects that it will be wonderful to be back at Winterfell with his sons, but he remains angry\nbecause the kingdom is in a crisis: Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers will beggar the realm, or sell it to\nthe Lannisters. Then there is the murder of \nJon Arryn\n. Ned considers taking a ship back to Winterfell, even though\nhe would prefer the \nkingsroad\n, so that he can stop at \nDragonstone\n and maybe learn the truth from \nStannis Baratheon\n.\nThe more he thinks about it, the more Ned guesses the truth is a secret he may not want to know. He looks again at\nthe assassin’s dagger and wonders if it has some connection to the mystery of Arryn’s death. Could Robert be part of\nit? He remembers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NED<|>PERSON<|>Eddard Stark, also known as Ned, is the Hand of the King who resigns in
