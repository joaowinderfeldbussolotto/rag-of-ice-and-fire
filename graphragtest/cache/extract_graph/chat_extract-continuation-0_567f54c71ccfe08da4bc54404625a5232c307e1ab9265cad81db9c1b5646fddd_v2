After she leaves, Jaime inquires as to\nwhat Jonos seeks from the situation. Jonos insists on acquiring a quarter of the \nHouse Blackwood\n lands, saying that\nthey were stolen from them long ago, and that \nTywin Lannister\n promised them to Jonos if he subdued the\nBlackwoods. Jaime chides the \nBracken\n man saying that they were once an enemy of the king when they sided with\nthe \nStarks\n, and keeping his head is more than enough compensation for what the \nMountain\n did to his lands. Bracken\nprotests that he will keep faith with the crown as he did with the Starks; Jonos adds that a dozen good men of his\ndied at the \nRed Wedding\n with \nRobb Stark\n and he bent the knee because he saw no point in fighting on for a lost\ncause. Jaime remarks that Lord Jonos is a prudent man on hearing this, yet privately thinks Blackwood might be\nconsidered more honorable.\nJaime then goes to parley with \nTytos Blackwood\n. Inside he sees the castle's massive \nweirwood\n tree from which the\ncastle derives its name; the tree is black and leafless. Tytos tells Jaime that it is the fault of the Brackens, poisoned\nand barren for a thousand years, and in another thousand it will turn to stone as weirwoods never rot. As they treat,\nJaime tells him that he does not have to physically kneel to him. They agree to a confession, fealty, pardon, and\nfinancial sum as well as lands. Finally they discuss the matter of a hostage, and Jaime asks for \nBethany\n, his\ndaughter, but Tytos refuses as she is his only daughter. They eventually agree to sending \nHoster\n as he is a bookish\nboy who may enjoy his time in \nKing's Landing\n and all the books there. Jaime then leaves quickly as he has\nappointments in Riverrun and King's Landing. The boy is ready to leave with him within an hour. Before departing,\nhe meets Ser Jonos to tell him the resolution, but also informs him that a daughter of his is to attend to the queen in\nthe capital, as she too is to be a hostage.\nJaime rides to the village \nPennytree\n with Hoster, who tells him of the history of the lands and animosity between the\nBlackwoods and Brackens. In the village stands an ancient oak tree with pennies nailed to it, the namesake of the\nvillage. There, \nBrienne of Tarth\n finds them, bandaged on her face, and with the sword \nOathkeeper\n. Brienne claims\nthat she has found \nSansa\n, and that Jaime must accompany her alone or else \nSandor Clegane\n will kill the girl.\nNavigation:\nJaime VII\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nTyrion X\n ←\nJaime I\n→ \nJon X\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 49: Jon X\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon IX\n↑\nJaime I\n ←\nJon X\n→ \nDaenerys VIII\n↓\nJon XI\nSynopsis\nMelisandre\n is conducting the marriage ceremony between \nAlys Karstark\n and \nSigorn\n, the new \nMagnar\n of \nThenn\n.\nOnly a few brothers of the \nNight's Watch\n attend, along with Queen \nSelyse\n, her queen's men, and a few king's men\nthat \nStannis\n left behind.

Knowing that Stannis will execute\nCregan when he learns of the betrayal, Jon tries to get Cregan to take the black and accept Alys' claim to Karstark.\nCregan won't hear about it, but Jon thinks time spent in the ice cell might change his mind.\nAt Alys and Sigorn's wedding feast, a raven brings message that the relief fleet for \nHardhome\n, delayed due to the\nbad weather, has now left \nEastwatch-by-the-Sea\n. \nCotter Pyke\n is commanding the fleet and he left behind \nGlendon\nHewett\n in charge of Eastwatch. Jon is unsure of Hewett's loyalty due to his association with \nJanos Slynt\n and \nAlliser\nThorne\n. \nAxell Florent\n once again presses Jon to release the whereabouts of \nVal\n, as he intends to marry her, but Jon\nscoffs at the idea.
