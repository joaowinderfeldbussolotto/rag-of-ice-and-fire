Jaime had hoped to slip out unnoticed, but his father's men entered the\nthrone room, and they thought Jaime meant to give the throne to his father, but Jaime told them he didn't care who\nwas proclaimed king. He was waiting on the Iron Throne to see who would come to claim the kingdom, but it was\nEddard Stark\n who found him there. Eddard said nothing but he saw the blood of the king Jaime had sworn to protect\non Jaime's hands.

The Spider reveals that \nTywin Lannister\n means to\nrestore \nPycelle\n as \nGrand Maester\n, since the archmaesters of the \nCitadel\n claim that “only the conclave can unmake a\nGrand Maester”. When the conclave meant to send Maester \nGormon\n, Lord Tywin acted at once, not wishing another\nTyrell\n on the \nSmall Council\n.\nTyrion is surprised to learn that Varys has whisperers even in the Citadel, where the conclave always meets in\nsecrecy. He finds out that \nBoros Blount\n has been restored to the \nKingsguard\n, and that \nMandon Moore\n had been\nbrought to \nKing's Landing\n by \nJon Arryn\n. Tyrion asks Varys to bring \nShae\n to the eunuch's chambers so that no one\nwill notice their meeting. He realizes that he cannot trust Varys any further, but hopes to use him this one last time.\nWhen he meets Shae, he means to send her away to protect her from his father, but Tyrion once again cannot bear to\npart with her. He also knows he must deal with the singer \nSymon Silver Tongue\n if he means to keep Shae in King's\nLanding.\nNavigation:\nTyrion I\n↑\nJaime II\n ←\nTyrion II\n→ \nArya II\n↓\nTyrion III\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 13: Arya II\nPlace(s): \nInn of the Kneeling Man\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya I\n↑\nTyrion II\n ←\nArya II\n→ \nCatelyn II\n↓\nArya III\nSynopsis\nArya is gathering vegetables when she hears voices.

The men say\nthey are \nKingsmen\n and ask them to come with them to a nearby \ninn\n. Arya hesitates but after Anguy shows how\nskilled he is with the bow she realizes that they stand no chance and she agrees.\nAt the inn Gendry remains in the stable to watch their horses although Tom assures them that they are safe. Arya\nand Hot Pie enter the \ninn\n with the three men. The innkeeper sold them horses and gave them directions. Tom and his\nfriends were waiting for them to get the horses back but they did not see them.\nTom gives Arya a paper acknowledging a future payment of three \ndragons\n after the war for their horses. Arya\nprotests and wonders how they will be able to reach \nRiverrun\n. Suddenly Gendry runs in to warn them that there are\nstrangers outside.\nThe people in the inn are not worried but Arya is afraid that it will be Ser \nGregor Clegane\n's men. She slams a\ntankard in Lem's face and tries to escape but to no avail. The men outside come in and among them, Arya recognizes\nHarwin\n.
