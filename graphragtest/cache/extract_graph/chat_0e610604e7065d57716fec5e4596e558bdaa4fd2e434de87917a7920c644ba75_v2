Lancel touches his sword and warns Tysrion to watch his words. Tyrion in turn warns him that\nat a cry from him, \nShagga\n will break in and kill Lancel with an axe and not a wineskin. Lancel, incensed, tells\nTyrion that he is a knight. Tyrion asks if Cersei had him knighted before or after she took him to bed. Lancel says\nnothing, and Tyrion can tell from his eyes that Varys was right. When Tyrion comments, Lancel demands Tyrion\nwithdraw his filthy accusations. Before he can finish, Tyrion mentions the result if Joffrey discovers he murdered his\nfather to bed his mother. Lancel's courage deserts him as he insists to Tyrion that \nTywin Lannister\n commanded\nLancel to do everything that Cersei told him when he was assigned squire to King \nRobert I Baratheon\n. Tryion asks if\nTywin told him to fuck Cersei also, noting that Lancel looks somewhat like \nJaime\n, but a poor copy. Lancel starts to\nsay he only did has he was bid, to which Tyrion adds that he must have hated every instant of a high place in court,\nknighthood, and Cersei opening her legs, and then threatens to go to the king. Lancel begs for mercy as Tyrion\ncontinues his threats to go to the king, whom he is duty bound to inform. When Lancel states he will end it, Tyrion\ntells him no, that he will stay close to Cersei, be a spy for him, and tell no one. Lancel agrees, and Tyrion orders him\nto drink to their understanding. Tyrion then tells Lancel that he could do well out of this and that knighthood is\nnothing. Then he orders him to tell the queen that he begs her forgiveness, and he will let her have Pycelle to do with\nhowever she will, but he will not be on the council. With respect to Ser Jacelyn Bywater, Lancel is to assure the\nqueen that he thinks he can win him away from Tyrion. Tyrion also notes he does not want another nephew. Lancel\ntells him that there is no need for concern since Cersei has him spill his seed on her belly.\n\nAfter he leaves, Tyrion thinks it fortunate that Lancel's father \nKevan Lannister\n has two other sons, since in Tyrion's\nview, as Cersei will kill Lancel if she finds out he is betraying her, and even if Lancel survives the war, he will never\nsurvive Jaime's return to King's Landing, the only question being whether Jaime kills Lancel in a jealous rage or\nCersei kills him to stop Jaime from finding out. Tyrion privately bets on Cersei.\nTyrion cannot get to sleep, so he sends Podrick, who was asleep, to summon \nBronn\n and get two horses saddled.\nWhen Bronn arrives, he asks “Who pissed in your soup?” to which Tyrion answers Cersei. He states he should be\nused to the taste and that she seems to have mistaken him for \nEddard Stark\n. Bronn replies that he was tall, to which\nTyrion responds not after Joffrey took off his head.\nThey leave through the postern gate, then down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of \nAegon's high hill\n onto Pigrun\nAlley. Tyrion reflects that the men that have been Hand have been no match for Cersei because they were too\nhonest. The only way to defeat Cersei is to play her own game. In the crowded brothel, they are met by \nChataya\n,\nwho leads them to the common room and serves them wine, apologizing for the quality; she cannot find good wine\nat any price, which Tyrion understands. As Tyrion waits, \nDancy\n slides onto his lap, saying she has a cure for him\nfeeling unloved. He tells her that he has grown fond of \nAlayaya\n's remedy. When Alayaya arrives, she leads him up\nthe stairs, and tells him that Dancy has a bet with \nMarei\n, and has only a fortnight before she loses her black pearls.\nShe leads him to the Tower Room, telling him that she will sleep while he is gone before he disappears down the\nshaft to the tunnel.\nAs he leaves the stables on his gelding, he hears music that reminds him of the words \nTysha\n sung to him, who was a\nlie, a whore Jaime had hired to make him a man.\nHe arrives at the manse which has been arranged by Varys as a place to sequester \nShae\n. He told Varys he wanted her\nprotected by ugly, scary men who did not like having sex with women. She is now protected by a \nBraavosi\ndaggerman\n with a hare lip and a lazy eye, one \neunuch strangler\n, and a pair of foul smelling \nIbbenese\n who are fond of\naxes and each other. If Tyrion had her guarded by his \nclansmen\n, it would only be a matter of time before everyone\nknew of his concubine.\nHe enters the room not intending to disturb Shae, but the sight of her nude body makes him hard. He spreads her\nlegs and starts to lick her until his beard is soaked and then enters her, and explodes almost at once. She opens her\neyes and tells him she just had the sweetest dream.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0e610604e7065d57716fec5e4596e558bdaa4fd2e434de87917a7920c644ba75_v2"}
