The \ntaking of Griffin's Roost\n was quite easy; the Golden\nCompany only lost four men in the attack. Any raven trying to leave the castle was shot down, followed shortly by\nthe castle's \nmaester\n being thrown from his tower. After that, what was left of the garrison surrendered.\nTaking his leave of the Golden Company officers by claiming to be going to pray at his father's tomb in the castle\nsept, Jon instead goes to the battlements and reminisces over the time \nRhaegar\n visited his home and seemed\nimpressed with Connington's lands. Jon then reflects on what happened next to \nhis House\n; after \nAerys\n exiled Jon,\nfurious at his failure to stop Robert, the lands and title went to his cousin \nRonald Connington\n (who had been Jon's\ncastellan while he was in \nKing's Landing\n) but after the end of \nRobert's Rebellion\n, \nKing Robert\n stripped Ronald of\nhis lordship and gave most of House Connington's lands to houses that had fought for him. Jon, however, is glad that\nhe will not have to fight his deceased cousin or Ronald's son \nRonnet\n, who is away fighting in the Riverlands, to\nreclaim Griffin's Roost, not wanting to celebrate his return by killing one of his own kin. Nor does he blame his\ncousin any longer for taking advantage of his downfall, since as far as Jon is concerned, the one responsible for\nHouse Connington's downfall is himself.\nJon's musings then turn to where he lost everything: \nStoney Sept\n. Taking over pursuit of Robert from the \nTyrells\nafter the \nBattle of Ashford\n, Jon cornered the rebel in the town and began searching for him. But the search yielded\nnothing, as the townsfolk were protecting Robert, hiding him and constantly moving him. All of Connington's\nefforts to find Robert- offering bribes for information, taking hostages, threats and pardons- got him nowhere, and\nthe delays bought time for \nEddard Stark\n and \nHoster Tully\n to bring a rebel army to Robert's rescue. The rebels\nattacked Connington's men at the same time Robert and his followers emerged from the town in a counterattack, and\nthe \nensuing battle\n ended in a rebel victory. For years, Jon reflects that he insisted he did all he could, until \nMyles\nToyne\n disabused him of that notion by pointing out that \nTywin Lannister\n would have burned Stoney Sept to the\nground to kill Robert, then offered pardons to Stark and Tully when they arrived to convince them to give up and go\nhome. Connington, however, knew this would mean killing everyone in the town, and he both didn't want to be\nbranded a murderer and wanted the glory of slaying Robert for himself. Jon reflects that his failure at Stoney Sept\nled to Rhaegar's death at the Trident and vows not to fail Prince Aegon as he failed his father.\nRe-joining his fellows, Jon takes note of the captives, including Ronnet's brother, sister and bastard son. Most of the\ncastle staff swear loyalty to him. Connington pays a visit to \nHaldon\n, who is trying to interpret where most of the\nGolden Company, scattered along the coast by the Volantene ships that transported them from \nEssos\n to send a\nmessage to \nDoran Martell\n to inform him that his nephew \nAegon\n is alive, in order to gain the Dornish alliance. Jon\nreflects that he could not have expected loyalty from these men if he had reclaimed his home while \nRobert\n and\nRenly\n still held the Stormlands. Haldon also argues that they need to offer incentives to convince recalcitrant lords\nto join them-as most of the gold and land will go to the Golden Company officers that was taken from their\nancestors, Haldon suggests offering the hands of Prince Aegon and Jon himself for marriage alliances. Jon, however\nrefuses, in the face of his illness and his insistence that Aegon must be free to wed \nDaenerys Targaryen\n if she ever\nreturns home. In his chambers, Jon privately treats his \ngreyscale\n with wine. If his condition became known, he fears\nthat any lords still loyal to \nHouse Connington\n would abandon him.\n\nFour days later, Prince Aegon arrives along with \nDuck\n, the first member of his \nKingsguard\n. Jon recalls his\ndisapproval of that choice and how he argued with Aegon that they should leave places in his\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
