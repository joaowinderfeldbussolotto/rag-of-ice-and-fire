He asks after\nthe children, and Catelyn tells him they are deciding on the names for their new wolves. Ned notes that the \nman\n he\nexcecuted is the fourth deserter this year. He adds that the man was half mad, that something had put a fear into him\nso deep that he could not reach him. The \nNight's Watch\n is dwindling, down to less than a thousand men, not just\nfrom desertions, but from ranging casualties. One day Ned may have to call his banners to fight \nMance Rayder\nhimself. Catelyn warns him that there are darker things beyond \nthe Wall\n. Ned replies that the \nOthers\n have been dead\nfor eight thousand years, and that \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n claims they never existed at all. Catelyn replies that nobody had\nseen \ndirewolves\n until today.\nWhen Ned asks why Catelyn has come, she tells him that \nJon Arryn\n, his foster father and her brother-in-law, is dead.\nThe news came in King \nRobert\n's own hand. When asked, Catelyn explains that Jon Arryn's widow--Catelynn's sister\nLysa Arryn\n--and her \nson\n have returned to the \nEyrie\n and says that she thinks her sister should not be alone and should\nhave gone back to \nRiverrun\n. Ned urges Catelyn to take the children to keep her sister company, but then Catelyn\ninforms him that \nRobert Baratheon\n has also written to say he is coming to \nWinterfell\n. This news gladdens Ned; it\nhas been nine years since he last saw his old friend. However, Catelyn is worried about the omen of a \ndirewolf\n found\ndead in the snow with an \nantler\n buried in its throat.\nWith Robert coming, Catelyn confirms with Ned that they should send word to his brother \nBenjen\n on \nthe Wall\n. Then\nCatelyn informs Ned that Robert's wife \nCersei Lannister\n, their children, and her \nLannister\n brothers are also coming.\nNed does not like the Lannisters because they came to Robert’s cause only after \nvictory\n was certain.

Viserys\nwishes to win back \nhis father's\n \nthrone\n and is in need of an army, which he hopes to acquire by making a \nmarriage\nalliance with a \nDothraki\n \nkhal\n who leads a large \nkhalasar\n.\nViserys presents Daenerys with a gift from Magister Illyrio, a fine silk dress. Daenerys has to look like the princess\nshe is, so Khal \nDrogo\n will ask for her hand in marriage. Although Daenerys is doubtful of Illyrio's motives, Viserys\ninsists that the Magister simply wants to earn his good graces. Afraid of angering her brother (which he calls\n\"waking the \ndragon\n\"), Daenerys keeps silent about her mistrust. Viserys warns Daenerys not to fail him, and twists\none of her niples to emphasize his threat. According to Viserys, when history of his reign is written, it will be said\nthat his reign began that night.\nViserys departs, leaving Daenerys alone with her thoughts. She dreads the feast she has to attend that evening, and\nher mind wanders to \nWesteros\n, the homeland she has never seen. She had been conceived shortly before her mother,\nQueen \nRhaella Targaryen\n, fled \nKing's Landing\n with Viserys, and born nine months later on \nDragonstone\n.
