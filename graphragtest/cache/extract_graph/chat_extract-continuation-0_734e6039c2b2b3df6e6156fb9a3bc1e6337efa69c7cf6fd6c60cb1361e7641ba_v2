The \nNight's\nWatch\n ship \nBlackbird\n will take them only so far as Braavos, and then Sam will need to find tender there bound for\nOldtown\n. Sam is hopeful that the others making the journey with him will find happiness when they reach their\ndestination: Gilly and the babe at \nHorn Hill\n, Maester \nAemon\n back at the \nCitadel\n, and \nDareon\n in his new role as a\nrecruiter. The old maester tells them the story of his sea trip to the Wall- how he traveled with Lord Commander\nDuncan the Tall\n as his honor guard, along with \nBrynden Rivers\n, Lord Bloodraven himself, who was sent by \nEgg\n to\nserve out the remainder of his life in the Watch.\nAs the trip progresses, Sam finds that nothing he says can console Gilly, and that Maester Aemon's health\ndeteriorates. Dareon has nothing but scorn for the \nwildling\n girl, but Aemon tells Sam to look closely at the baby to\nfind the source of Gilly's grief. When Sam realizes that the baby is actually \nDalla\n and \nMance Rayder\n's, not her own,\nhe can't believe what \nJon\n did. Maester Aemon states, \"What threats the Lord Commander made, what promises, I\ncan only guess.\" And while Sam understands that Jon did so to save the baby from \nMelisandre\n's fires, he remains\nshocked at what cost this will have for Gilly.\nNavigation:\nSamwell I\n↑\nBrienne III\n ←\nSamwell II\n→ \nJaime II\n↓\nSamwell III\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 16: Jaime II\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime I\n↑\nSamwell II\n ←\nJaime II\n→ \nCersei IV\n↓\nJaime III\nSynopsis\nAn honor procession flanks Lord \nTywin\n's casket as it heads west, led by many of the Lannister bannermen. \nJaime\nfalls in with his uncle \nKevan\n, and they discuss the attack on \nSaltpans\n. Jaime cautions his uncle not to try and take on\nSandor Clegane\n or \nBeric Dondarrion\n, and that he would have made a good \nHand\n. Kevan rejects him coolly, and lets\nJaime know he knows about the relationship of the twins.\nAs Jaime returns to \nKing's Landing\n, he looks upon the encamped Lannister army, which will soon board the\nRedwynes'\n fleet to lay siege to \nDragonstone\n. He finds his sister in her solar as Grand Maester \nPycelle\n delivers news\nthat Ser \nBronn\n has named \nLollys\n's bastard newborn \"\nTyrion\n\". Jaime realizes that his sister may try to have Bronn\nkilled for this jape, and he recalls the look on her face the night of \nTommen\n's wedding when the \nTower of the Hand\nwas aflame. This called to mind the madness of King \nAerys\n and the way he would become arosed by fire. Jaime\nrecalls Aerys' rape of \nhis wife\n the evening he had Lord \nChelsted\n burned alive. Jaime had the guard of the queen's\nbedchamber when she was screaming for her husband to stop. When Jaime said that they were sworn to protect her\ntoo, his partner that night, Ser \nJonothor Darry\n, replied, \"We are, but not from him.\"\nJaime asks to speak with Cersei alone, and asks her why she keeps Lady \nTaena\n around all the time, knowing that she\nis a spy for \nMargaery\n. Cersei responds that Taena is more her spy, considering that the Queen Regent can do more\nfor the \nMerryweather family\n. Jaime cautions that she doesn't truly know the woman, but Cersei remarks that she\nmay make \nTaena's husband\n the Hand. After Jaime asks her about the rumor that she plans to name \nAurane Waters\nher new master of ships, he recommends that she would be better off naming \nPaxter Redwyne\n. But Cersei will not\nput any Tyrell vassals on her small council. Cersei also defends her choice of \nQyburn\n, a disgraced and twisted\nmaester, to join the council. Cersei's growing paranoia and brutality are becoming more evident and Jaime retorts,\n\"You are seeing dwarfs in every shadow and making foes of friends. Uncle Kevan is not your enemy. \nI\n am not your\nenemy.\" However, Cersei throws him out of her solar in fury.\nIn the White Sword Tower, Jaime speaks with \nLoras Tyrell\n, asking him what he knows of certain famous\nkingsguard.
