She hates the villagers for being sheep almost as much as she hates herself for\nbeing a lamb, not a direwolf as the sigil of her house suggests. By now the \nLannisters\n have taken everything from\nher: father, friends, home, hope, courage, \nNeedle\n. They broke her wooden sword in front of her. They have even\ntaken away her secret of being a girl. She was still able to pee in privacy at the storehouse, yet on the open road that\nis not possible, even though she tried to hold it. \nHot Pie\n gaped at her when she skinned her breeches at a brush in\nfront of all, but nobody else even looked. Clegane's men didn't care at all.\nTheir captors have forbidden them to talk and they punish those who disregard the order, as Arya has learned herself\nby getting her lip broken. They smashed with a spiked mace the face of a boy who wouldn't stop calling for his\nfather; then \nRaff the Sweetling\n killed the boy's mother as well when she started screaming. Arya sees no purpose\n\nany longer in being brave, so she watches people die and does nothing. One woman who was questioned tried to be\nbrave, but she died screaming just as the rest did. There are no brave ones left on this march, only women and\nchildren and very old or very young men. The other men were chained to the gibbet and left as food for wolves and\ncrows. They only spared \nGendry\n because he admitted that he had forged his helmet himself, as blacksmiths are too\nvaluable to be killed.\nThe Mountain tells them that they will be taken to \nHarrenhal\n to serve Lord \nTywin Lannister\n, a last chance given to\nrebels and traitors, which they should take: \"Obey, serve, and live.\" Arya hears people arguing about this when they\ngo to sleep that night. An old woman laments that what is being done to them isn't just, as they didn't commit any\ntreason. Dondarrion's me just came and taken everything from them, as Clegane's did. Unlike the Mountain's men,\nDondarrion's did the village folk no harm though, another woman points out, and \nThoros of Myr\n even paid for what\nthey took. Only with signed papers, the old woman replies, and those don't lay eggs as the chicken they took from\nher used to. Having made sure that no guard is looking, she spits three times for all Lannisters and \nStarks\n and \nTullys\n.\nAn old man says that the old king would have never stood for this sin and shame. Arya, forgetting herself, asks\nwhether he is talking about \nKing Robert\n, but the man meant \nKing Aerys\n. Then a guard interferes, the old man loses\nhis two remaining teeth and everyone falls silent.\nBesides the prisoners, Clegane's band is also taking pigs, chickens, a cow, and nine wagons of salt fish to Harrenhal.\nThe Mountain and his men are riding horses, but the captives have to walk and are killed if they cannot keep up or\ntry to flee. The guards pick women at night and go into the bushes with them, receiving almost no resistance. There\nwas one girl, prettier than the rest, who had to go with four or five different men each night, until she finally hit one\nwith a stone one day. Clegane himself beheaded her with his massive two-handed greatsword and made everyone\nwatch. He commanded that the body was to be left for the wolves. Arya has a side-look at Needle, worn at the hip\nby a black-bearded, balding man called \nPolliver\n, thinking how good it is that they took the sword from her, as she\nwould have used it to stab Glegane that moment – and that would likely have ended with her being left as food for\nthe wolves as well.\nPolliver is hardly the worst of the lot, Arya thinks. By now she knows every one of Clegane's men, when they were\nonly nameless strangers the night she was caught. It's important to keep in mind who of them is lazy or brutal, smart\nor stupid. The one they call \nShitmouth\n has the foulest tongue she ever heard, yet he will give you an extra piece of\nbread if you ask, while jolly old Chiswyck or soft-spoken Rafford will only hit you. Arya observes them and listens\nto their talk, polishing her hates the way Gendry used to polish his helmet. She hates \nDunsen\n for wearing Gendry's\nhelmet, Polliver for taking Needle and Chiswyck for thinking he's funny. She hates even more the people she knows\nare responsible for the death of ones close to her: Raff the Sweetling for the death of \nLommy\n, \nAmory Lorch\n for the\ndeath of \nYoren\n, \nMeryn Trant\n for the death of Syrio, \nthe Hound\n for the death of \nMycah\n, \nIlyn Payne\n and Joffrey and\nCersei\n for the death of \nher father\n, \nFat Tom\n,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_607fa9f360940646576d8a996ccfa4bfe628c1cc236ae3282f8f96502b45d6c5_v2"}
