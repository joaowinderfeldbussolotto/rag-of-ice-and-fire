Hailing from \nthe Reach\n, the Oakhearts\nhave long been enemies of the Dornish. The kingsguard knight left \nMyrcella\n playing \ncyvasse\n with Prince \nTrystane\n,\nand under the protection of the prince's \nsworn shield\n Ser \nGascoyne\n. Arys recalls his recent first meeting with Prince\nDoran\n, who advised him that Myrcella would be safer at the \nWater Gardens\n. All her guards and Ser Arys would\naccompany them there, but Doran asked him not to write \nKing's Landing\n about the move. When he arrives at\nArianne's secret location, he swears he will do no more than tell her it has to end, but her nakedness overwhelms\nhim.\nAfter their passion is sated, Arys is once again consumed by guilt, but Arianne has a response for every one of his\ndoubts. The knight feels he has dishonored himself enough already, and he doesn't want to dishonor her. But\nArianne's seductive words and gestures are difficult for him to disregard. When Arianne reminds him that he told her\nhe loved her, Arys responds that he has sworn a vow. However, Arianne brings up several Kingsguard who broke\ntheir vows, most famously \nLucamore the Lusty\n and \nTerrence Toyne\n, and even Prince \nAemon the Dragonknight\n(though Ser Arys doesn't believe the latter story). She finishes with, \"It is not our love that dishonored you, it is the\nmonsters you have served and the brutes you've called your brothers.\" When Arys tells her that King \nRobert\n was no\nmonster, he can't help but think that she is right about \nJoffrey\n. Although he considers \nTommen\n to be Joffrey's\nopposite, he can't disagree with Arianne's persuasive words that Myrcella would be a better ruler.\nTheir conversation moves to \nCriston Cole\n, Lord Commander of \nViserys I\n's Kingsguard. At the time of Viserys'\ndeath, Ser Cole convinced Viserys' son Aegon II to claim the rule of the Seven Kingdoms. This led to the war\nbetween Aegon and his elder sister Rhaenyra, whom Viserys had long groomed as his succession.\nArianne reminds Arys that in Dorne, the eldest child rules, and had it not been for Criston the Kingmaker, even the\nTargaryen inheritance might have been rewritten. She then explains to him the real reason that Myrcella is being\nmoved to the Water Gardens: \"To keep her away from those who'd seek to crown her.\" Arys tells her that the Water\nGardens are not a prison, but she warns him that \nHotah\n will see that Myrcella does not leave, claiming he is terrible\nwhen aroused.\nStill unable to convince Arys that her suggestions are correct, Arianne hugs him and begins to tremble. Once again,\nshe manipulates him by asserting that if the \nSand Snakes\n can be imprisoned by her father for wanting to crown\nMyrcella, she could too. She mentions that there are no secrets between \nTyene\n and herself, and then tells him her\nfather has never considered her worthy. Prince Doran tried several times to marry her off to old men of high birth,\nand when she was 14 she discovered a letter her father had written to her brother \nQuentyn\n, a ward of \nLord Anders\nYronwood\n for years. In the letter, Doran wrote, \"one day you will sit where I sit and rule all of Dorne, and a ruler\nmust be strong of mind and body.\"\nSer Arys argues that this couldn't be true, but when she asks him where Prince Quentyn is now and his response is\nwith Lord Anders Yronwood in the \nBoneway\n, Arianne tells him that is what her father wants everyone to believe.\nShe has gotten word from some of her friends that Quentyn is across the \nNarrow Sea\n, and she is sure that he is hiring\nthe \nGolden Company\n, who recently broke their contract with \nMyr\n. The Golden Company has never broken their\nword since \nBittersteel\n reformed them nearly a hundred years ago, and since most of their members are exiles, the\nonly reason they would change allegiance would be to return home to \nWesteros\n. And Anders' ancestors fought in\nthree of the \nBlackfyre Rebellions\n, a fact that convinces Arianne that he seeks to crown Quentyn as the next Prince of\n\nDorne.\nArianne's final persuasive words are, \"So your two princesses share a common cause, ser... and they share as well a\nknight who claims to love them both, but will not fight for them.\" Ser Arys then swears to defend Myrcella's right to\nrule, and to protect Arianne from anyone seeking to steal her birthright. When he asks her what she would have of\nhim, Arianne purrs, \"All.
