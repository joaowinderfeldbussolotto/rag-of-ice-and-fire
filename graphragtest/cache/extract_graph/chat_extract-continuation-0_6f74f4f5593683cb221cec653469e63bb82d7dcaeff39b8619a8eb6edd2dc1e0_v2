When Ryman persists, stating that he is the heir to the Crossing, Jaime punches him in the face with his\ngolden hand. He then dismisses Ryman back to the Twins, sick of the man's whoring and drinking, and takes the\nbladed crown that his whore wears. When Jaime places Edwyn in charge of the Freys, Jaime witnesses a glimpse of\nthe contempt Edwyn feels for his own father. Jaime also demands that Lord \nWalder\n release all the hostages that he\nhas imprisoned at the Twins.\nJaime asks that Ser Ryman's singer accompany him back to his pavilion, and has his squires draw a bath for Edmure.\nJaime informs Edmure that he will be returned to Riverrun forthwith, and if he yields the castle, all will end well for\nhim.\n\nThe terms are that the \nsmallfolk\n can stay and serve Lord \nEmmon Frey\n, Ser Brynden will be permitted to take the\nblack along with any of the garrison who choose the same, and Edmure and his pregnant wife \nRoslin\n will be well-\ntreated prisoners at \nCasterly Rock\n. If their child is a boy, Jaime says he will serve House Lannister as a page and\nsquire, and they will grant the boy some lands when he gets his knighthood. If it is a girl, the Lannisters will make\nsure she has a good dowry when she is old enough to wed.\nWhen Edmure asks what will happen should he refuse to yield, Ser Jaime indicates that he will assault Riverrun's\nwalls in waves, sending the ex-Tully bannermen first as fodder, then the Freys, and finally his cousin \nDaven\n's\nwestermen, and he would demolish Riverrun and put all within its walls to the sword. As Jaime leaves the tent,\ncommanding \nRyman's singer\n to play \"\nThe Rains of Castamere\n\" for Edmure, the former Lord of Riverrun pleads,\n\"No. Not him.

The \nGrand Maester\n denies this, explaining that he visits the young queen to give her\nsleeping potions, but \nCersei\n knows otherwise. Forcing a confession from him that he also brings Margaery \nmoon\ntea\n, she then commands him to announce that Lord Rosby's dying wish was to donate all his lands and incomes to\nthe Crown.\nLady \nTaena\n wonders how Margaery could be so foolish, but Cersei is too excited to care. She does realize that she\nwill need more proof in order to have Margaery executed for treason, knowing that she must arrange to have the girl\ncaught in the act. She asks Taena and her husband to bring the \nBlue Bard\n to dinner that night.\nDuring the meal, Cersei demotes Ser \nHarys Swyft\n to Lord Treasurer, and with the position of \nHand\n now vacant, she\noffers the title to Lord \nOrton Merryweather\n. Lord Orton accepts, although he is notably uncomfortable during the\ndinner, particularly due to the presence of Margaery's favorite singer.\nCersei wastes little time moving on to the Blue Bard, accusing him of sleeping with Queen Margaery. The singer\ndenies it, despite Cersei smashing him in the face with his own lute, and even later in the black cells under\ninterrogation by \nQyburn\n. But the defrocked maester tortures the singer into submission, and they lead him to say\nwhat they want. He accuses several others of also having carnal knowledge of Margaery, and then Cersei promises\nthat he will be allowed to take the black after he confesses in front of the court.\nLater, Taena persuades Cersei to name \nAlla\n as innocent, since they may be able to use her to bear witness against\nMargaery and her other cousins. At breakfast, \nTommen\n mentions that Margaery will be at the Sept for \nMaiden's\nDay\n.\nCersei then launches the final move of her scheme, commanding Ser \nOsney\n to go before the High Septon and admit\nhis sins of \"bedding\" Margaery, \nElinor\n and \nMegga\n. The youngest Kettleblack agrees to do so, but states, \"\nThe best\nlies have some truth in 'em... to give 'em flavor, as it were\n,\" so the Queen Regent then allows him to have his way\nwith
