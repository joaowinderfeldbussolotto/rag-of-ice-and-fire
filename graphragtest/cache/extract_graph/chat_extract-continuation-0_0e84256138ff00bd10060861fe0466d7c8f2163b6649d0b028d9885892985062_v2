His right hand is swathed in bandages halfway to\nthe elbow and pains him constantly. When he threw the burning curtains onto the \nwight\n of \nOthor\n, Jon burned his\nhand more seriously than he realized, but Maester \nAemon\n has assured him that there will be no permanent damage\naside from the scars. Jon is glad, however, that only \nGhost\n can see him writhe and weep from the pain at night. Yet,\nwhen he does manage to sleep, Jon has nightmares of battling a wight with \nhis father\nâ€™s face that are far worse.\nJon notices that the Lord Commander looks old and grumpy without his beard, which has been shaved after it was\nbadly singed in the fire. Mormont explains to Jon that the rangersâ€™ search has found no sign of \nhis uncle\n or more\nwights; two of those were bad enough. Still both Mormont and Maester Aemon are sure there will be more because\nthe cold winds are rising.\nJon states there was a bird last night, saying he hoped for news of his father. Mormont assures Jon that he would\nhave told him if there was. This message brought word that Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n has been cast out of the \nKingsguard\nand is now wanted for treason, having killed two \ngold cloaks\n sent to arrest him. Mormontâ€™s distaste is plain for men\nwho would send gold cloaks to arrest a knight as renowned of Ser Barristan the Bold. The Lord Commander goes on\nto lament that they have \nwhite shadows\n in the woods, \nundead\n stalking the halls, and a \nboy\n on the \nIron Throne\n.\nMormont notes that Grand Maester \nPycelle\n did not include any news about Jonâ€™s sisters; they only tell the Night's\nWatch what they want them to know. Jon thinks that \nhe\n is only told what Mormont want \nhim\n to know; he has heard\nnothing of his brother \nRobb Stark\n in the south.\nMormont asks when Maester Aemon believes Jon will be able to resume using his hand. Jon says soon and the Lord\nCommander brings out a sword, declaring that Jon is ready for it. Jon is puzzled but is told to take the sword. He\nrecognizes it as a \nbastard sword\n of \nValyrian steel\n. Mormont explains that the sword is named \nLongclaw\n and has\nbelonged to \nHouse Mormont\n for five centuries. After it was burned in the fire in his tower, Mormont has had the\npommel remade into the likeness of a white wolf's head with red garnets for eyes.\nWhen he was young, Jon dreamed of doing great deeds and being granted \nIce\n in reward for saving his fatherâ€™s life,\nbut he knew it was a folly. Now the memory that he might wish to steal his brotherâ€™s birthright shames him. Jon\ndoes not feel that he deserves Longclaw either and attempts to decline, but Mormont insists he has earned it with his\nquick thinking to use fire to destroy the wight. Jon accepts, but reminds himself that Mormont is not his father and\nhe still dreams of Ice.\nMormont tells Jon that he will now have to practice his two-handed strokes as well, suggesting that Ser \nEndrew\nTarth\n from the \nShadow Tower\n, who will assume the duties of master-at-arms, can help him. Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n has\n\nbeen sent to \nKing's Landing\n with the hand of \nJafer Flowers\n to attempt to get the boy kingâ€™s attention. Mormont\nexplains that a message from an anointed high-born knight should get more attention than from an old crow. It also\nputs a thousand leagues between Jon and Ser Alliser.\nMormont insists, however, that none of this means that he approves of Jonâ€™s actions: it takes a man to wield\nLongclaw and he expects Jon to act the part. Jon agrees, thinking again that it is not the blade he would have chosen,\nbut a fine one. He is also glad to be free from Ser Alliser. Then Mormont sends Jon to fetch his supper. As he leaves,\nJon sees the guards smiling; one man comments on the swordâ€™s quality and another tells Jon he earned it. Jon is\nangry but cannot say why.\nOutside, Jonâ€™s friends are waiting for him, wanting to see the sword. Pyp jokes that Jon is probably the only man in\nthe entire history of the Nightâ€™s Watch to be rewarded for burning down the Lord Commander's Tower. Even Jon\nhas to smile; no one blames him for setting the fire that destroyed the wight, even if it did gut the top two floors of\nthe tower. The other wight was hacked to pieces, but not before killing Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n and four other men. The\nthought of the wights sours Jonâ€™s mood and he quickly leaves his friends to get the Lord Commanderâ€™s supper. Jon\nis deeply affected by facing the wight, but does not blame his friends for not understanding. They cannot\nunderstand; they did not see the pale glow of the blue eyes or feel the cold black hands. They also do not know of\nthe fighting in the \nriverlands\n.\nGhost is lying beside the door to his room. Jon thinks back to when he found the \ndirewolf\n hidden in the snow.
