Drogo\nis stroking her, waking her passion, and when he enters her the stars are gone, great wings fill the sky, and the world\ntakes flame. Then she sees Ser \nJorah’s\n drawn and sorrowful face telling her that the last dragon was \nRhaegar\nTargaryen\n while standing over a hot brazier containing red-hot stone eggs. In turn, he is replaced by \nViserys\n with his\nmolten gold crown screaming \n“The dragon does not beg, slut,”\n and \n“I will be crowned.”\n Then he painfully pinches\nher nipples and suddenly Daenerys is frantically running to a distant \nred door\n that is her salvation. She knows that\nthe darkness is there, but she does not dare look back or she will be lost. She sees \nher son\n as a grown warrior, proud\nand tall, before flames consume him. Then the \nghosts of kings\n are lining the hallway urging her to go faster. Then\nshe is flying over the \nDothraki Sea\n, and all are fleeing before her. She finally throws open the red door to see her\nbrother Rhaegar, the last dragon, in his armor, but when she opens his visor she sees her own face.\nDaenerys wakes to the taste of ashes, with \nJhiqui\n standing over her. Her body hurts very much. She calls for\nsomething, but does not know what. Jhiqui says “Yes,” and bolts from the tent shouting. When they return,\nDaenerys is crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah carries her back to bed and tells her to sleep and then \nMirri\nMaz Duur\n gives her something in a cup. A dreamless sleep takes her.\nIt is dark when Daenerys wakes again. She calls for her handmaidens and they attend to her. They tell her that she\nhas been sick for a long time. Then Mirri Maz Duur gives her wine and as she falls asleep, asking for a dragon’s\negg. The next time she wakes, Daenerys has the pale dragon’s egg in her arms and it is warm. There is fine sheen of\nperspiration on her that she names “dragon’s dew.” There is no fever and she feels strong. She calls for her\nhandmaidens and asks for a bath, Mirri Maz Duur, Ser Jorah, Drogo, and her child. Her handmaids avoid answering\nabout Drogo and her child, and Daenerys knows that her child is dead.\nMirri Maz Duur and Ser Jorah enter to find Daenerys standing over the other eggs, which are all warm. However,\nwhen asked, Ser Jorah does not feel the heat from the eggs. Ser Jorah looks gaunt and limps from his wounds. He\ntells Daenerys that her son never lived, but Mirri Maz Duur tells her that the child was monstrous: lizard-like, with\nscales; his skin fell off, revealing a body filled with grave worms and the stink of corruption, as if he had been dead\nfor years. She states that her son was strong when Ser Jorah brought her into the tent. Mirri Maz Duur explains that\ndeath was in the tent and that the shadows touched her.\nDaenerys realizes that Ser Jorah killed her child by taking her into the tent, for love and loyalty to her. Daenerys\nstates that she thought the life of the horse would be payment enough and is told that was a lie she told herself.\nDaenerys is not sure if she knew. Daenerys realizes that the life of the horse, her son, \nQuaro\n, \nQotho\n, \nHaggo\n, and\nCohollo\n paid for the life of Drogo. She asks to see what the price bought. Ser Jorah cannot dissuade her and has to\n\nhelp her stand since she is weaker than she thought.\nOutside, in the glaring sun, Daenerys can see there is little left: a scattering of tents, a few score of horses, and\nperhaps a hundred people. They are the old, the frightened, and the sick. \nJhogo\n reminds her that a \nkhal\n who cannot\nride is no \nkhal\n. She learns that \nKo\n \nPono\n declared himself \nkhal\n first, and \nJhaqo\n after him. They took most of the\nriders, the herds, and the slaves because Daenerys’ own \nkhas\n was too weak to stop them; it is the right of the strong\nto take from the weak. Most of the rest left during the following nights. \nMago\n, now a \nbloodrider\n to Khal Jhaqo,\nseized \nEroeh\n (whom Daenerys had denied him) and raped and murdered her. Daenerys repeats her mantra, “If I look\nback I am lost,” and swears that Mago and Jhaqo will die screaming. Irri warns her that Jhaqo now has 20,000\nriders, but Daenerys insists that she is \nthe blood of the dragon\n. Then she asks to see Drogo.\nDrogo lies unmoving, unseeing, and covered in \nbloodflies\n. Daenerys asks why he is outside alone and Ser Jorah\nexplains that he seems to like the warmth and staring at the sun with eyes that cannot see. He will follow where led\nand eat if food is put in his mouth, but otherwise does nothing.
