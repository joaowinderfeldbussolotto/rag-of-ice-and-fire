She wonders if she should have him removed. Tommen and Cersei\nboth notice the stench that is emanating from her father's corpse.\nAfter the service, the procession of mourners come to offer condolences to Cersei. First is \nFalyse Stokeworth\n, who\nmentions that \nher sister\n is ready to give birth and the family would like to name the child Tywin. Cersei is offended\nand brusquely forbids her. Next is \nLancel\n who is still looking half dead. As he begins to mention his love and then\nhis new-found faith, Cersei heads him off by saying, \"Atonement is best achieved through prayer. Silent prayer.\"\nThe only mourner to please Cersei is \nTaena Merryweather\n, who promises that all her friends in the \nFree Cities\n have\nbeen notified to watch for and seize Tyrion.\nWhen \nMace Tyrell\n comes before her, he mentions that his uncle \nGarth\n is on the way to assume the duties of \nMaster\nof Coin\n. The Queen Regent, not wishing to see another Tyrell on the small council, immediately backpedals that\nGyles Rosby\n has already accepted the post. This upsets Tyrell and \nhis mother\n, as Tywin had wanted Garth to assume\nthe position. The Queen of Thorns then brings up the terrible smell in the sept, and Cersei wants nothing more than\nto get rid of the clever old woman. But Lady Olenna states she will not depart until \nMargaery\n is wed to Tommen.\nLeaving the Sept, Cersei rides back to the \nRed Keep\n with \nGyles Rosby\n, asking him belatedly to be her new master of\ncoin, which he accepts.\nBack in her rooms, \nQyburn\n pays her a visit, revealing that he discovered in the undergaoler's sleeping cell a gold\ncoin that dated back to the \nGardener\n Kings of the Reach. Once again, Cersei is suspicious that the \nTyrells\n had a hand\nin Tyrion's escape and Tywin's murder. Qyburn then asks if he may experiment on the dying \nGregor Clegane\n in the\nblack cells\n, since he is more adept at the nature of death than any of the \narchmaesters\n from the \nCitadel\n. She agrees\nwith his request, but tells him to bring her Gregor's head when he dies, as her father had promised it to \nDorne\n.\nFinally, \nKevan\n meets with her for dinner, as she had requested.\nCersei asks him to be Tommen's \nHand\n. Kevan first admonishes her for making Mace Tyrell look a fool in front of\nhalf the court. He then informs her that he would rather help his son Lancel take control of Castle \nDarry\n. He offers\nto take up the position as Hand, provided Cersei removes herself from \nKing's Landing\n and returns to \nCasterly Rock\n.\nCersei is infuriated and a fierce argument takes place during which she threatens Kevan. Unfazed, Kevan counsels\nher to name \nRandyll Tarly\n or \nMathis Rowan\n as Tommen's Hand. As both men are Tyrell vassals, this makes Cersei\neven more angry and she accuses him of abandoning Tommen. As he departs, Kevan reveals that he knows who\nTommen's father really is.\nNavigation:\nCersei I\n↑\nArya I\n ←\nCersei II\n→ \nJaime I\n↓\n\nCersei III\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 8: Jaime I\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nJaime IX\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nCersei II\n ←\nJaime I\n→ \nBrienne II\n↓\nJaime II\nSynopsis\nStanding a planned seven day vigil over \nhis father\n's funeral bier, \nJaime\n finds himself with a lot of time for thinking.\nHe feels that he is as much to blame for his father's death as \nTyrion\n or \nVarys\n. He also finds himself wondering what\nhappened to the eunuch. His thoughts then turn to the day that Prince \nRhaegar\n rode for the \nTrident\n. Jaime had\nbegged not to be left behind to guard the king, but Rhaegar told him that \nAerys\n feared Lord Tywin more than he did\nRobert\n, and meant to keep Jaime at his side as insurance. Mounting up, Rhaegar's last words to Jaime were, \"When\nthis battle's done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but...well, it does no\ngood to speak of roads not taken.\" Finally, Jaime recalls his recent questioning of the \nchief undergaoler\n, which was a\ncomplete farce as Jaime knew far more than the man did, since he was the perpetrator.\nWhen Jaime learned that the two gaolers who were put to sleep were killed by \nBoros Blount\n and \nOsmund\nKettleblack\n, he reprimanded them, warning them never to act on \nhis sister\n's orders to kill anyone without consulting\nhim first.
