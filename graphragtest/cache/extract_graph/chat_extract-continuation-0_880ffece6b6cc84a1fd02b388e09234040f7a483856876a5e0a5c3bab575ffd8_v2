Lancel also does not join\nthem for dinner. Lady Amerei begs Jaime to stay and help them defeat Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n, the \nHound\n, and the\nother outlaws. He learns that the outlaws seem to be following \na woman\n now, cloaked and hooded, and no one has\nseen Beric Dondarrion for a while. Jaime's companion \nStrongboar\n claims to be moved by Ami's words, and\npromises to return after they take \nRiverrun\n to sort out the Hound. Jaime leaves the table and goes to the sept. Three\narmed sparrows bar his path, but Lancel lets him in.\nLancel admits that his father left after they quarrelled, and that he does not intend to consummate his marriage. And\nthen he admits his greatest sins: serving the wine that resulted in King \nRobert\n's death, and that he had been sleeping\nwith \nCersei\n.\nLancel states that he plans to forsake his title as Lord of Darry, and head to \nKing's Landing\n to swear vows as a\nWarrior's Son\n. When Jaime learns that Cersei has rearmed the faith, he is almost as upset by this as he is to discover\nthat \nTyrion\n was not lying about Cersei's infidelity. Later, in the yard, Jaime admits to Ser \nIlyn\n that he slept with\nCersei when she was at Castle Darry with Robert. Cersei wanted him to get \nArya Stark\n and he would have killed her\nhad he found her first.\nNavigation:\nJaime III\n↑\nThe Reaver\n ←\nJaime IV\n→ \nBrienne VI\n↓\nJaime V\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 31: Brienne VI\nPlace(s): \nthe \nQuiet Isle\n \n \nNavigation:\nBrienne V\n↑\nJaime IV\n ←\nBrienne VI\n→ \nCersei VII\n↓\nBrienne VII\nSynopsis\nUpon reaching the \nQuiet Isle\n, \nBrienne\n and her companions are taken up the path to see the \nElder Brother\n. Brienne\nmentions to the brother guiding them that she is heading for \nSaltpans\n to kill \nthe Hound\n. This takes the man aback,\nbut he tells them to speak to their elder. They see a huge horse in their stables, obviously a war horse, who has\nmauled two of the brothers. On a hill, they pass a \nhuge cloaked novice\n digging graves. The man appears lame, but\nthey cannot see his face.\nThe Elder Brother speaks further of the horrible raid on Saltpans, made worse by the fact that Ser \nQuincy Cox\n hid\nbehind his castle walls and did nothing to help the villagers.\nAfter dinner, the Elder Brother speaks in private with Brienne. He asks what she seeks in Saltpans, and when she\nmentions a highborn girl, the elder knows she refers to \nSansa\n. He lets on that it is the wrong Stark she seeks, for the\nHound captured \nArya\n. Shocked that both of Lady \nCatelyn\n's daughters may yet be alive, she is equally surprised\nwhen he informs her that Sandor Clegane is dead. The Elder Brother has buried his corpse himself, and left the\nhound's-head helm on the grave. It was \nsome other outlaw\n who found and wore it when they raided Saltpans.\nHe goes on to tell her that he took pity on Sandor before he died, and will only say that \n\"he is at rest\"\n when she asks\nif he is truly dead. The elder remarks that the horse in their stables was the Hound's, \nStranger\n.\nThe Elder Brother then tells her that he was once a knight who fought for Prince \nRhaegar\n at the \nTrident\n. He took\nseveral terrible wounds in the battle and fell into the river, yet awoke upon the shores of the Quiet Isle. He urges her\nnot to be another casualty of this war, and return home. Brienne breaks down and cries, telling him her story,\nfinishing with, \n\"I have to try to save her... or die in the attempt.\"\nNavigation:\nBrienne V\n↑\nJaime IV\n ←\nBrienne VI\n→ \nCersei VII\n↓\nBrienne VII\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 32: Cersei VII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei VI\n↑\nBrienne VI\n ←\nCersei VII\n→ \nJaime V\n↓\nCersei VIII\nSynopsis\nMargaery\n is fuming at \nCersei\n and \nher council\n that the Throne must respond at once to the \nironmen's attack on the\nShield Islands\n.
