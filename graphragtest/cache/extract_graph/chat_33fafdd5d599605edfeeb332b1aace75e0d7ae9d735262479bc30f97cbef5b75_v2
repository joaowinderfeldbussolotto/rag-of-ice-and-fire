Yet every night Drogo would come and ride her from behind. She had been miserable until she had\ndreamt of a dragon that engulfed her in flame and cleansed her. After that, each day had been easier than the one\nbefore it and she had found pleasure in the new sights of the journey, even starting to enjoy sex with Drogo.\nOnce she is totally alone, Daenerys decides to dismount and take off her boots so she can feel the earth. Suddenly,\nViserys is there, screaming and grabbing her. He is furious that she commanded him to stay on the ridge with the\nothers. For the first time in her life, Daenerys shoves him back. For a moment Viserys is shocked, but then the rage\nreturns and Daenerys sees that he intends to hurt her badly. Before he can, \nJhogo\n’s whip catches Viserys around the\nneck and pulls him to the ground.\nHer handmaiden \nIrri\n translates for them as Jhogo asks if Daenerys would like to see Viserys dead or disfigured as\npunishment for his attack. Daenerys declines, but tells them to take Viserys’ horse and make him walk, an\nemasculating punishment among the horselords. Viserys, now recovered enough to shout, orders Ser Jorah to kill the\nDothraki and discipline Daenerys, but the exiled knight makes the decision to turn to Daenerys and agree that\nViserys should walk.\nDaenerys is amazed that she hit Viserys and asks Jorah if she has woken the dragon in Viserys. Jorah replies her\nbrother Rhaegar was the last Dragon, while Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake. Daenerys insists that Viserys\nis still the rightful king, but when Jorah asks if she would want her brother as the king, she realizes that Viserys’\nwould not be a good king. Even so, Daenerys remains convinced that the people of \nWesteros\n are praying for Viserys\nreturn until Jorah explains that peasants only pray for rain, health, and a summer that never ends. Daenerys declares\nthat Viserys will never be able to retake the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, realizing that she has known this for a long time.\nViserys could not lead an army even if her husband gave him one.\nDaenerys races her silver ahead of Jorah and the others. It is dusk by the time she returns to the \nkhalasar\n. Daenerys\nimagines the laughter in the \nkhalasar\n when news spreads about Viserys; by the time her brother can return, everyone\n\nin the camp will know him as a walker.\nAs she enters her tent, Daenerys sees a finger of light touch her dragon eggs and, for a moment, she sees scarlet\nflames before her eyes. When she touches the eggs they feel hot, which she attributes to the sunshine during the day.\nDaenerys remembers all of the stories about other magical creatures and wonders why there should not also be\ndragons. Her Dothraki handmaidens, \nIrri\n and \nJhiqui\n, tell her that dragons were all killed by men. However, her\nLysene\n handmaiden \nDoreah\n, a former sex slave, tells Daenerys a story about a time when there were two moons in\nthe sky, but one came too close to the sun and cracked to release the first dragons. The story ends by claiming that\none day the other moon will crack and the dragons will return. The other handmaidens make fun of the story,\ninsisting that the moon is a goddess, not an egg.\nDaenerys sends Irri and Jhiqui away but orders Doreah to stay with her for dinner. When Drogo returns, she takes\nhim outside because Dothraki customs say that everything of importance must be done under the open sky. When\nDrogo tries to take her from behind, Daenerys tells him that she wants to see his face and climbs on top of him. She\nrides Drogo as fiercely as she has ever ridden her horse and in the moment of his pleasure Drogo calls out her name.\nOn the far side of the Dothraki Sea, on her 14th name day, Daenerys’ handmaiden Jhiqui brushes her stomach and\ntells her that she is pregnant.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nDaenerys III\n→ \nBran IV\n↓\nDaenerys IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 24: Bran IV\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran III\n↑\nDaenerys III\n ←\nBran IV\n→ \nEddard V\n↓\nBran V\nBran\n is roused from his depression when he is called to the Great Hall of \nWinterfell\n to receive \nTyrion Lannister\n.\nDespite \nRobb\n’s rudeness, Tyrion provides plans for a saddle that will allow Bran to ride a horse once more.\nSynopsis\nBran\n watches from his window seat as \nRickon\n plays with the \ndirewolves\n in the yard below. \nShaggydog\n’s fur has\ndarkened to black and his eyes are fiery-green; \nSummer\n has turned to silver-and-smoke with yellow-gold eyes that\nsee everything.
