Thirty years later when Bael was \nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\n and led the wildlings south, it was his son,\nthe new Stark lord, who slew Bael, since the bard would not harm his son. Upon returning home, the young lord’s\nmother killed herself when she found out Bael was dead. The young lord was said to have eventually been killed by\none of his bannermen\n. Jon does not believe the story, which claims that the blood of the Starks and the wildlings is\nthe same.\nWhen Qhorin and the others arrive, Ygritte recognizes the Halfhand and confirms that the wildlings would kill him\nif he yielded. Qhorin’s men state that she should be killed, and Qhorin leaves Jon alone with Ygritte to carry out the\ntask. Ygritte tells Jon that \nMance Rayder\n would accept him if he ran off with her.

And \nVarys\n the Spider pays in gold for anything overheard, making Dontos believe that \nMoon Boy\n has\nbeen working for Varys for years. Dontos tells her that \nStannis\n burned the \ngodswood\n at \nStorm's End\n at the behest of\nthe \nRed Woman\n. When Sansa asks him to make good on his promise, Dontos tells her the time is not right for their\nescape. Dontos does promise her that when his friend returns to \nKing's Landing\n, they will have a ship to escape on.\nSansa does not want to return to her room yet, so she goes up to the roof, where she is surprised by \nthe Hound\n.\nClegane is in a foul mood as ever, and tells her that he enjoys killing, and that only cowards fight with fire. He\nclaims he fears no man, but Sansa thinks that he does fear \nhis brother\n. Once again, he assures her that there are no\ntrue knights\n.\nThat night, Sansa has a dream where she is surrounded by a mob, and calls out to all the great knights, but none\nrespond to her call. She feels herself bleeding, and awakes to find the sheets soaked with blood. She realizes that she\njust had her first \nflowering\n, and burns the sheets in fear that \nJoffrey\n will find out and want to bed her. Her maids\ncatch her and bring her before \nthe Queen\n, but Cersei comforts her, knowing the girl is frightened at the prospect of\nmarrying Joffrey. She tells her how difficult Joffrey was to bear, and how \nRobert\n was out hunting when Joffrey was\nborn. Cersei informs her that while Sansa may not love Joffrey, she will love the children she bears him. The Queen\nalso reveals that Robert always wanted to be loved, to have friends and be cheered, and that her brother \nTyrion\n had\nthe same disease. She tells Sansa: \n\"Love is poison.

Qhorin\nconfirms this. He knew Mance when he was a black brother, and the ranger tells Jon that Mance loved songs and\nwildling\n women, and that he was a wildling captured as a child by the Watch. He was the best ranger they had, but\nhe returned to his roots, some say to gain a crown. Qhorin suspects that Jon let Ygritte go, and Jon confirms that he\ndid, however Qhorin understands that the girl was not a threat, and if he had wanted her dead he would have had\nEbben\n do it, or have done it himself. Qhorin tells Jon that he now knows him better than he did before, and that it is\nimportant for a commander to know his men.\nThey travel at night and rest during the day. That morning, Jon dreams of five direwolves, when there should have\nbeen six. Seeing through the eyes of \nGhost\n, he finds himself in a forest and senses a voice calling his name from a\nnearby \nweirwood\n with a face resembling \nhis brother\n's, except it has three eyes. His brother explains to him how to\nopen his eyes, and the tree reaches down and touches him, and he finds himself back in the mountains. He is atop a\ncliff, and oversees thousands of men training for combat.
