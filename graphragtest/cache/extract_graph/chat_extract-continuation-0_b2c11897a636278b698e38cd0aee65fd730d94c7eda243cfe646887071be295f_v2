Jaime\nasks Loras about the supposed ghost of \nRenly Baratheon\n that fought at the \nBattle of the Blackwater\n at the van of his\nfather's forces, obtaining an admission that it was \nGarlan Tyrell\n inside the armor. Then he confronts Loras about\nBrienne\n, and commands him to judge the woman fairly, on his honour as a knight.\nConsidering Jaime’s words about \nRenly\n’s death, Ser Loras nearly breaks down, stating, \"\nWhen I saw him all bloody,\nwith her fled ... if she’s innocent, then \nRobar\n and \nEmmon\n…\n\" Jaime absolves him of killing the two \nRainbow Guard\nin a rage, and then sits alone in the room, contemplating the other debts he still has to pay.\nNavigation:\nJaime VII\n↑\nTyrion IX\n ←\nJaime VIII\n→ \nSansa VI\n↓\nJaime IX\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 68: Sansa VI\nPlace(s): \nunnamed tower\n of House Baelish in the \nFingers\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa V\n↑\nJaime VIII\n ←\nSansa VI\n→ \nJon IX\n↓\nSansa VII\nSynopsis\nSansa\n is alarmed to discover that \nLittlefinger\n has no intention of bringing her home; instead she is being taken to \nthe\nVale of Arryn\n. They land at \nthe tiny tower\n of \nHouse Baelish\n that Petyr is lord of, and he stresses that Sansa must use\na new name, calling her \nAlayne Stone\n so that no one will know who she really is.\nShe learns that \nOswell\n is actually the \nKettleblacks\n' father, and Littlefinger leads her to discern that it was the \nQueen\nof Thorns\n who poisoned \nJoffrey\n when she took one of the amethysts from Sansa's hair net. All the plans were\narranged by Littlefinger, who met Lady Olenna when he brokered the alliance that joined \nHighgarden\n and \nHouse\nLannister\n.\nSoon after, \nLysa Arryn\n arrives with a small retinue, and she insists that Petyr wed her now at his tower instead of the\nEyrie\n. Lysa wants to make another child with Petyr, after \nher father\n aborted the first child years ago. A drunken\nMarillion\n tries to seduce Sansa that night, but \nLothor Brune\n forces him away. The next morning, Petyr tells Alayne\nthat Lysa now knows the girl's identity.

The two accuse Jon of being a turncloak and\noathbreaker, and they even use the captured \nRattleshirt\n to support their accusations.

She tells the assembled court\nthat she was an innocent girl before Tyrion abused her and turned her into his whore. When Shae lies how Tyrion\nmade her call him \n\"Giant of Lannister\"\n, the public starts to laugh. Furiously, Tyrion tells them to take Shae away\nand let him confess. Instead he demands a trial by battle. As Cersei's champion is the formidable Ser \nGregor\nClegane\n, she insist that the judges grant Tyrion's request. \nMace Tyrell\n, one of the judges, asks Tyrion who his\nchampion is. To the consternation of the court it is \nOberyn Martell\n, another judge. \nTywin\n is angry but grants\nTyrion's request and sets the date for the battle on the next morrow.\nThe next morning Tyrion
