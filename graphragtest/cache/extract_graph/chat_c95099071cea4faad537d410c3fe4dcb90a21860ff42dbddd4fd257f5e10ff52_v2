Ignoring this answer, she\nasks what he is doing to free \nJaime\n, who is worth a hundred of Tyrion. Tyrion quips that they do not have a hundred\nof him to trade to \nCatelyn Stark\n. Angered, Cersei declares him worse than useless and leaves.\nIn truth, Tyrion fears Stannis twice as much as Renly; Renly is beloved but inexperienced in war, while Stannis is\ncold, hard, and inexorable. The spies sent to Dragonstone are ominously silent, though \nLysene\n war galleys have\nbeen spotted and \nVarys\n reports \nsellsail\n captains taking service with Dragonstone. If Stannis and Renly attack\ntogether by sea and land there will be no chance for Joffrey, or himself.\nPodrick Payne\n meets him at the door of his solar and shyly informs him that Petyr Baelish is inside. He finds\nLittlefinger seated by the window, watching Joffrey kill hares with his new crossbow in the yard below. Observing\nJoffrey's poor aim, Littlefinger quips that the hares are winning and advises Pod to invest in pots since the castle will\nsoon be overrun with hares and they will be eating potted hare for every meal. Tyrion dismisses Pod and offers\nLittlefinger refreshment. Littlefinger politely declines, noting that he has heard to drink with Tyrion is to risk being\nsent to the Wall.\nTyrion compliments Littlefinger on his clothing and notes his \nValyrian steel\n dagger with the \ndragonbone\n hilt. There\nis mischief in Littlefinger's eyes when he responds that is a trifle plain and offers it to Tyrion as a gift. Tyrion\nrefuses, infuriated that Littlefinger knows why he mentioned the dagger and is mocking him because he thinks\nTyrion cannot touch him. Tyrion reflects that his brother Jaime is famous for his gilded steel armor, but if ever a\nman truly armored himself in gold it is Littlefinger. Ten years ago, \nJon Arryn\n gave him a minor position in customs,\nwhere he soon tripled the revenue. Within three years he was master of coin, and now the crown's revenues are ten\ntimes what they were. The crown's debts have grown vast, too, but Littlefinger is a master juggler and borrows so he\ncan put the gold to work. He invests in wagons, shops, ships, houses, agribusiness, textiles, and moneylending, and\nthe \ngold dragons\n breed and multiply. At the same time, Littlefinger moved his own men into place:, the \nKing's\nCounter\n, the \nKing's Scales\n, all four \nKeepers of the Keys\n, and the officers managing the three mints are his, as well\nnine of every ten among as the harbormasters, tax farmers, customs agents, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, and\nwine factors. All of them are mostly men of middling birth, lesser lordlings, or even foreigners, but far more capable\nthan the highborns they replaced. No one questioned the appointments because Littlefinger is perceived as harmless\nwithout soldiers, holdings, or marriage prospects, yet Tyrion is unsure if he can touch him.\nTyrion asks how close Littlefinger was with the \nTully\n children during his fostering at Riverrun. Littlefinger boasts\nthat he took both girl's maidenheads, which Tyrion considers a very smooth lie. Tyrion explains that Catelyn and\nLysa\n would refuse any offer he might make, but they might trust Littlefinger. He adds that he hopes to sway the\nmore tractable Lysa by offering her Jon Arryn's true killer. Intrigued, Littlefinger asks who, but Tyrion only says\nthat Lysa would have to understand he only gives gifts to his friends, meaning she must first ally with the\nLannisters. Littlefinger points out that Lysa has her own woes, such as the \nVale mountain clans\n, who are now more\naggressive and better armed thanks to Tyrion. Tyrion promises to use his influence to call off the clansmen if Lysa\ndeclares for Joffrey. Littlefinger insists Lysa will never make war on the Starks or Tullys, but Tyrion assures him\nLysa's power would only be used to oppose Renly or Stannis. In return, Tyrion will give her justice, peace, name her\nson \nWarden of the East\n, and wed his niece Princess \nMyrcella\n to little Lord \nRobert Arryn\n.\nLittlefinger asks what Cersei thinks of the ploy, and laughs when Tyrion only shrugs. Then, Littlefinger asks what\nhis reward will be, and Tyrion promises him Harrenhal and supremacy over the \nriverlands\n as their \nliege lord\n.\nLittlefinger's reaction amuses Tyrion; by birth he holds only a few stoney acres on the \nFingers\n, but Harrenhal is one\nof the realm's richest domains. Littlefinger is suspicious, especially considering that \nJanos Slynt\n also received\nHarrenhal for his good service, but Tyrion assures him that he is more valuable than Slynt. Appeased, Littlefinger\nnotes that he will likely have to bed Lysa again to get her consent and asks for a fortnight to prepare. As Littlefinger\n\ndeparts, Tyrion thinks to himself, \nTwo\n.\nNext,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c95099071cea4faad537d410c3fe4dcb90a21860ff42dbddd4fd257f5e10ff52_v2"}
