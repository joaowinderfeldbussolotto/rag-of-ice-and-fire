Varys asks\nforgiveness, but Tyrion refuses, angry that he must make a show of punishing the likes of Slynt and Deem while his\nsister continues on her savage course.\nTyrion insists Varys tell him everything he knows from now on, but Varys only says he knows quite a lot. Tyrion\npoints out Varys did not know enough to save the whore and her child. Varys says he took steps to save another\nbastard, an \nolder boy\n, but assures Tyrion he never dreamed the baseborn daughter of a whore would be considered a\nthreat. Tyrion remarks that being Robert’s was enough of a threat for Cersei. Varys blames himself, and comments\nthat the whore loved King Robert. Thinking of \nShae\n and \nTysha\n, Tyrion wonders if a whore can truly love anyone.\nHe recalls that, although he provided her with a rich manse and fine gifts, when he said Shae served him best\nbetween the sheets it was not what she wanted to hear.\nTyrion remarks that it seems Joffrey is truly to blame for Eddard Stark’s death, though Slynt and Ser \nIlyn Payne\ncarried out the sentence almost as if they expected it. Varys states that Tyrion can prevent further follies with the\nsupport of the gold cloaks, but there are still Cersei’s household red cloaks to consider. Tyrion responds that they are\nloyal to \nCasterly Rock\n and outnumbered by his \nVale mountain clansmen\n, not to mention six thousand gold cloaks if\nBywater is the man Varys claims.\nTyrion does not trust Varys, but cannot deny his usefulness. He asks Varys why he is so helpful and Varys replies,\n“You are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you.” Tyrion asks, “As you served \nJon Arryn\n and Eddard\nStark?” but Varys states he served as best he could, and he does not think Tyrion will share the same fate, since\npower is a curious thing. Varys brings up the riddle he asked Tyrion \nbefore\n. Tyrion says the answer depends on the\nsellsword\n, who holds the power of life and death. Varys wonders aloud why men pretend kings hold power if this is\ntrue. Tyrion points out that kings can call other swordsmen, but Varys only asks why these other swordsmen obey\nrather than rule. Neither the godly \nHigh Septon\n, nor the lawful Queen Regent, nor the ever-knowledgeable Varys\ncould prevent Eddard Stark’s death, so who truly killed him: Joffrey who gave the command, Ser Ilyn who swung\nthe sword, or another? When Tyrion asks for the answer to the riddle, Varys declares that power resides where men\nbelieve it resides. Tyrion asks if power is just a trick, and Varys agrees it is a shadow on the wall, though shadows\ncan kill and often a very small man can cast a very large shadow.\nTyrion smiles and declares he is growing fond of Varys, and though he may kill him yet he thinks he will feel sad\nabout it. Varys declares he will take that as high praise. Tyrion asks what Varys is, but Varys only says he is a loyal\nservant of the realm. Tyrion presses on to ask who made Varys a eunuch and who he \ntruly\n is. Varys’ smile never\nflickers, but his eyes show a very different emotion as he insists his tale is long and sad.\nVarys draws a parchment from his sleeve and reveals the master of the galley \nWhite Hart\n plans to defect to Lord\nStannis\n. Tyrion sighs that they should make an example of the man, which will serve both to discourage other\ncaptains and to keep Joffrey busy. Next, Varys informs him Ser \nHoras\n and Ser \nHobber Redwyne\n have bribed a guard\nand plan to escape on the \nPentoshi\n galley \nMoonrunner\n. Tyrion instructs Varys to have Bywater send the guard to the\nNight’s Watch and post a guard on the \nMoonrunner\n just in case. Next, Varys notes that the clansman \nTimett\n killed a\nman for cheating at tiles. When Varys confirms the man \nwas\n cheating, Tyrion declares Timett did all honest men a\nfavor. Next, Varys explains that the \nred comet\n has brought all manner of prophets to the city to preach doom and\ndestruction. Tyrion instructs Varys to let them rant. Finally, Varys states that when Lord \nGyles Rosby\n proposed a\ntoast to the king, Ser \nBalon Swann\n remarked they would need three cups for that and many laughed. Tyrion insists\nhe is not interested in treasonous table talk, which Varys calls wise.\nTyrion returns to his solar to find \nBronn\n waiting. The sellsword asks about Slynt, and Tyrion admits he has likely\n\nreplaced one of Littlefinger’s men with one of Varys’. Tyrion asks how the recruiting is going, and Bronn explains\nthat\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_78dd653d2fb697cec84be118896f1edfbe6366c48f40a2b14a7c24cdd6fe2f89_v2"}
