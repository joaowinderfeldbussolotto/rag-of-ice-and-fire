Cersei feels fear at the\nthought of being paraded through the streets naked, remembering the violence the smallfolk caused during the \nriot\n,\nbut reassures herself that no harm will come to her.\nWhen morning arrives, her goalers arrive with a group of \nSilent Sisters\n, who strip Cersei naked and shave her of\nevery hair on her body. Cersei is then led by an escort of \nWarrior's Sons\n (among them, her cousin \nLancel\n, much to\nCersei's disgust) to the courtyard, where Cersei finds herself standing close to the spot where \nEddard Stark\n was\nexecuted. As the Septas accompanying her announce her sins to the watching crowd, Cersei muses first on how\nJoffrey\n undid all her plans and the work of \nVarys\n and \nLittlefinger\n; had he done as he was told and sent Stark to \nthe\nWall\n, Ned and his knowledge of Cersei's incest would have been removed and the Lannisters would have had peace\nwith \nRobb Stark\n, a hostage in the form of \nSansa\n and the freedom to deal with \nStannis\n and \nRenly Baratheon\n, but\ninstead Joffrey demanded Stark's head, and after that everything fell apart. Cersei's thoughts then turn to memories\nof how \nher father\n did away with her \ngrandfather's\n mistress after his death, having her stripped naked and marched\nthrough the streets of \nLannisport\n, but Cersei insists to herself she will not be broken and humiliated so easily.\nCersei is then forced to strip before the crowd and walk to the Red Keep. At first, Cersei walks with dignity,\nignoring the insults and worse (such as rotten vegetables and a cat carcass) the crowd throw at her, but as the walk\ncontinues and the insults grow worse, mocking her faded beauty and the signs of age on her body, Cersei struggles\nto maintain her composure. As she walks, Cersei begins to hallucinate, seeing faces of others in the crowd; her\nfather frowning, Ned and Sansa Stark, along with \nSansa's wolf\n staring accusingly at her, \nTyrion\n laughing at her and\nfinally, the face of \nMaggy the Frog\n intoning her prophecy: \nQueen you shall be, until there comes another, younger\nand more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold most dear\n.\nAt this, Cersei breaks down in tears and runs for the Red Keep, collapsing as soon as she staggers into the courtyard.\nKevan Lannister orders her covered up and removed, at which point Cersei is picked up by an eight-foot-tall giant of\na man, clad in the armour and white cloak of a \nKingsguard\n knight. \nQyburn\n appears and introduces Cersei to his\nchampion, \nSer Robert Strong\n and she is most pleased.\nNavigation:\nCersei I\n↑\nThe Ugly Little Girl\n ←\nCersei II\n→ \nTyrion XII\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 66: Tyrion XII\nPlace(s): \nYunkish\n camp near \nMeereen\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion XI\n↑\nCersei II\n ←\nTyrion XII\n→ \nThe Kingbreaker\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n has made an agreement with \nBen Plumm\n to join the \nSecond Sons\n. He signs a number of agreements that he\nwill pay about 50 higher ranking members of the company 100 gold dragons. This amount increases for the higher\nranking officers, and for Plumm himself, he must sign a contract for 100,000 dragons along with land and a lordship.\nAfter this, he signs the register of the Second Sons using his own blood as ink.\nAfter this, he is told to go and find armor for himself and \nPenny\n. He returns to where she is sleeping, and there he\nnotices signs that she may have the \nbloody flux\n. Regardless, she is distraught over the abandonment of the hog and\nthe dog that were part of her show. Tyrion is hiding from her that the two animals have almost definitely been\nslaughtered by \nYezzan zo Qaggaz\n's men. While they are looking for armor, they find \nJorah Mormont\n outfitted in a\nrandom assortment of armor, which he claims is of decent quality.
