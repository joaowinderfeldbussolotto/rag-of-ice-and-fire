Sam quiets\nJon by telling him the Lord Commander probably intends to groom him for command. Sam explains that \nhis father\nonce insisted that he be at his side for all important events but once he fell out of favor his father no longer cared.\nSuddenly Jon is ashamed; Sam has accepted his situation like a man, while he has been playing the boy. Jon admits\nthat Sam is right and agrees to take his vows.\n\nLate that afternoon, they proceed through the cold tunnel under the Wall and through three gates that Bowen Marsh\nmust unlock. When they are finally outside again, Sam worries about the \nwildlings\n but is told they have never come\nthis close to the Wall. Never-the-less, they are joined by an escort of rangers. Jon whistles and \nGhost\n lopes out of the\ntunnel and then into the woods. The haunted forest is much like the \nWolfswood\n around \nWinterfell\n, but its feel is\nmuch more ominous. It is dusk when they finally arrive at a clearing with nine weirwoods, a number unheard of\nsouth of the Wall. Sam looks at the faces on each of the trees and says that he can feel the old gods watching.\nAs night falls, Jon and Sam kneel and say their vows together:\nNight gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands,\nfather no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in\nthe darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the\ndawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to\nthe Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.\nWhen they are finished, Bowen Marsh declares that they knelt as boys and now rise as men of the Night’s Watch.\nThe gnarled forester \nDywen\n says they should be getting back because there is something in the night he dislikes.\nThen Ghost returns, his red eyes and white face eerily like the faces carved in the weirwoods. In his jaws is a human\nhand.\nNavigation:\nJon V\n↑\nEddard XIII\n ←\nJon VI\n→ \nEddard XIV\n↓\nJon VII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 49: Eddard XIV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard XIII\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nEddard XIV\n→ \nArya IV\n↓\nEddard XV\nAfter King \nRobert\n’s death, \nNed\n convenes the \nsmall council\n to confirm him as Protector of the Realm. However, the\ncouncil is interrupted by a summons to the throne room where King \nJoffrey\n demands oaths fealty. Queen \nCersei\ndestroys Robert’s will and Ned declares Joffrey has no right to the \nIron Throne\n. When Ned calls for the \nCity Watch\nto seize Cersei and her children, the gold cloaks instead kill Ned’s men, and Littlefinger reveals his betrayal.\nSynopsis\nNed\n wakes to the thunder of \nLannister\n guardsmen drilling in the yard and curses \nCersei\n for not fleeing despite his\nwarnings.\nAt breakfast, \nArya\n is given permission for a short lesson with \nSyrio Forel\n as long as she is ready to leave by midday.\nSansa\n, who is very despondent, asks again to see Prince \nJoffrey\n before she leaves. \nSepta\n \nMordane\n offers to escort\nSansa, but Ned insists it is not wise. Sansa complains it is not fair and runs weeping from the solar. Septa Mordane\nrises to follow but Ned stops her, declaring that he will try to explain when they return to \nWinterfell\n.\nAn hour later, \nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n arrives with news that King \nRobert\n is dead. Although he has been expecting\nthe news, Ned is surprised by the emptiness it leaves inside him, as if part of him has died as well. Suppressing his\ngrief, Ned orders Pycelle to convene the \nsmall council\n in the \nTower of the Hand\n, not trusting the security of the\ncouncil chamber. The Grand Maester objects that they can wait a day, but Ned insists so Pycelle dispatches servants\nto carry the summons.\nSer \nBarristan Selmy\n arrives first and asks permission to attend King \nJoffrey\n instead, but Ned refuses. When\nLittlefinger\n arrives wearing the same clothes as the previous day, he declares that the task Ned set him is done.\nVarys\n arrives next with news that Lord \nRenly\n has left the city along with Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n and fifty retainers,\nslipping out a postern gate an hour before dawn and riding south for \nStorm's End\n or \nHighgarden\n. Ned is\ndiscomforted by the news, since he had remained hopeful of Renly’s support.\nNed entrusts Ser \nBarristan\n to read the writ naming him Protector of the Realm until the heir comes of age.
