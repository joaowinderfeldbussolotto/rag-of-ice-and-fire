Tyrion wonders if\nthat was his father's plan, then informs Cleos that the terms―including the exchange of \nWillem Lannister\n and Cleos'\nbrother \nTion Frey\n for \nSansa\n and \nArya Stark\n―are unacceptable, and Cleos will be expected to carry the \nsmall\ncouncil\n's counteroffer back to Riverrun. Cleos is not pleased with the prospect of recrossing a war zone and points\nout that it is \nCatelyn Stark\n who wants this peace, not Robb. Tyrion counters that Catelyn wants her daughters and\nurges Cleos to rest and await further instructions.\nTyrion rejoins Jacelyn Bywater watching several hundred recruits drilling beyond the gate. With so many refugees,\nthere is no lack of men joining the \nCity Watch\n for food and a bed, but Tyrion has no illusions about their worth in\nbattle. He commends Bywater for contacting him and instructs him to give Ser Cleos and his escort every hospitality\nbut to keep them outside the city to hide the truth of conditions there. He also instructs Bywater to use the jars the\nalchemists will deliver to train spitfire crews to handle wildfire using paint and burning oil. Bywater calls this a wise\nmeasure, although he has no love for \"alchemist's piss\". Tyrion agrees, but insists he must use what he is given.\nBack in his litter, Tyrion reflects that if he can use negotiations to keep Robb dreaming of an easy peace at Riverrun\nuntil Ser \nStafford Lannister\n readies his new host at \nCasterly Rock\n, then Stafford and Lord Tyrwin can smash Robb's\nforces between them. Tyrion only wishes the \nBaratheons\n would be as accommodating. With \nRenly\n creeping up the\nroseroad\n with his massive southron army and \nStannis\n poised to sail his fleet up the \nBlackwater Rush\n any day, Tyrion\ntakes small comfort from his stockpile of wildfire.\nA commotion in Cobbler's Square pulls Tyrion out of his musings. A sizable crowd listens to the rantings of a\nprophet garbed as a \nbegging brother\n. Calling the \nred comet\n in the sky above \nAegon's high hill\n \"the Father's\nScourge\", he proclaims:\nWe have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their\n\nincest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little \nmonkey\n demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools\nand give birth to monsters! Even the \nHigh Septon\n has forgotten the gods! He bathes in scented waters and\ngrows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and\ngold is all... but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the \nWhoremonger King\n is brought low! When\nthe boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and\nbiting! There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine\nof righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!\nWounded by being called a \"twisted little monkey demon\", Tyrion takes solace from the hoots of derision drowning\nthe echoing shouts as he orders the Burned Men to clear a path. He agrees with the prophet about the High Septon,\nhowever, smiling at the memory of a joke \nMoon Boy\n made at the gluttonous cleric's expense.\nReturning to the Red Keep without further incident, Tyrion ascends to his chambers in a hopeful mood, thinking all\nhe needs is time to piece it all together. Entering his solar, he is confronted by Cersei, who is furious at him for\nignoring her summons and plotting to sell her only daughter like a bag of oats. Knowing his \nploy\n has worked,\nTyrion points out princesses like \nMyrcella\n are born for such marriage alliances, unless Cersei planned to wed her to\nher brother \nTommen\n. Cersei declares she will not allow Myrcella to be shipped off to \nDorne\n. Without missing a\nbeat, Tyrion points out that Dorne will be much safer than King's Landing, and the feud between the Lannisters and\nHouse Martell\n goes back only a generation, whereas the Dornishmen have warred with \nStorm's End\n and \nHighgarden\nfor a millennium.\nTyrion explains that he proposed nine-year-old Myrcella become a ward of Prince \nDoran Martell\n until she turns\nfourteen, at which time she will marry \nTrystane Martell\n, who is just two years older. Cersei insists Myrcella will be\na hostage, but Tyrion opines that she will be treated more kindly than Sansa Stark, especially with Ser \nArys\nOakheart\n of the \nKingsguard\n as her \nsworn shield\n. Cersei still worries that Doran Martell might kill Myrcella to\navenge the murder of his sister \nElia Martell\n, but Tyrion insists Doran is too honorable to murder an innocent girl and\nthe terms are too rich to refuse: he has also promised the prince his sister's killer, a council seat, and some castles\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3431551119f3146be256ff1edfa251e5973b3a00145e68426473f378a3ab33c8_v2"}
