Ned asks about the boy’s mother as well, and is told that she is dead, but that\nshe was an alehouse wench with blonde hair. Ned examines Gendry and notices a remarkable resemblance to a\nyounger King Robert, especially his black hair and blue eyes.\nNed asks Mott who paid the boy’s apprentice fee. Mott claims he took the boy on for free since he was so strong.\nNed does not believe this for a moment. Mott admits that an unknown lord had paid twice the normal apprentice fee\nfor Gendry and said the extra money was for his silence. Ned decides he likes Tobho Mott. Before he leaves, Ned\ntells Mott to send Gendry to him if the day comes that he wants to wield a sword instead of forge one. Ned also\nquips that if he ever wants a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place he visits.\nAs he rejoins his guards outside, Ned still doesn’t understand what Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s bastard, nor why\nit led to his death.\nNavigation:\nEddard V\n↑\nJon IV\n ←\nEddard VI\n→ \nCatelyn V\n↓\nEddard VII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 28: Catelyn V\nPlace(s): \nCrossroads Inn\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn IV\n↑\nEddard VI\n ←\nCatelyn V\n→ \nSansa II\n↓\nCatelyn VI\nCatelyn\n and Ser \nRodrik\n take shelter from the rain at the \ninn at the crossroads\n. Soon after, \nTyrion Lannister\n and his\nparty arrive. Tyrion recognizes Catelyn, who had hoped to remain anonymous, and Catelyn takes this opportunity to\nconvince the men in the room to take Tyrion captive so he can face the king’s justice in \nWinterfell\n.\nSynopsis\nCatelyn\n and Ser \nRodrik\n are on the \nkingsroad\n, headed north to \nWinterfell\n. It is raining and Ser Rodrik suggests\nCatelyn should cover her head to keep from taking a chill. Catelyn, however, enjoys the feel of the rain on her face\nand replies that it is only water. The warm southern rain reminds Catelyn of her childhood with \nEdmure\n, \nLysa\n, and\nLittlefinger\n at \nRiverrun\n. Rains are much less pleasant in \nthe North\n.\nRodrik states it would be good to have a fire and a warm meal. Catelyn tells him that there is an \ninn at the crossroads\nonly a short way ahead. Catelyn remembers sleeping there many times when traveling with her \nfather\n when she was\nyoung, when it was run by a fat woman named \nMasha Heddle\n. Ser Rodrik reminds her that an inn is too public and\nthat it might be best to find a small holdfast if they do not want to be recognized. However, when they pass\nunrecognized by a party of soldiers led by Lord \nJason Mallister\n, a bannerman to her father, Catelyn decides they will\nnot be recognized at the inn.\nAt the inn, they are met by Masha Heddle, who gives them only a cursory look and tells them there are only two\nrooms available; she gives them none of the smiles or mention of sweet cakes that Catelyn remembers from her\ngirlhood. After changing into dry clothes, Catelyn thinks that from the crossroads they could go west to \nRiverrun\nwhere she could get advice from her father who has been unwell lately. To the east is the \nEyrie\n and her sister; Lysa\nmight be able to provide some answers, but the road across the mountains is too dangerous. Eventually, Catelyn\ndecides that it is best to continue north to \nWinterfell\n. Once past \nthe Neck\n they can get aid from one of the bannermen\nof \nHouse Stark\n. Then she can tell the bannerman to send riders north to \nRobb\n with orders to place a watch on the\nkingsroad.\nCatelyn turns her thoughts to the reliability of Riverrun’s banners. If it comes to war, Catelyn is sure her father will\ncall his banners, but she is not sure they will all come. \nRobert's Rebellion\n showed how unreliable the river lords can\nbe, particularly the \nFreys\n, who arrived to aid their Tully overlords only after the \nBattle of the Trident\n had been won,\nleaving doubts as to which army they had come to join. Ever since, Catelyn's father has called Lord \nWalder Frey\n the\n“Late Lord Frey\". Other banners—such as the \nDarrys\n, \nRygers\n, and \nMootons\n—fought for King \nAerys II Targaryen\n.\nCatelyn decides she must not let a war erupt.\nSer Rodrik comes to escort her to dinner, suggesting they must hurry if they are to eat and calling her the customary\n“my lady.” Catelyn decides it might be safer to pretend they are father and daughter. Rodrik agrees, but in the\nprocess he calls her “my lady” again, and comments on how old ways die hard when he realizes his mistake.\nIn the long and drafty common room the benches are crowded with a wide variety of people, but Catelyn doesn't see\nanyone who\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_912bc6a566fd3412a5fcb32f68f79297eab179b076948cd44da99aa7dbcf112c_v2"}
