Littlefinger is suspicious, especially considering that \nJanos Slynt\n also received\nHarrenhal for his good service, but Tyrion assures him that he is more valuable than Slynt. Appeased, Littlefinger\nnotes that he will likely have to bed Lysa again to get her consent and asks for a fortnight to prepare. As Littlefinger\n\ndeparts, Tyrion thinks to himself, \nTwo\n.\nNext, Tyrion heads to his bedchamber to await Varys. An hour later, \nGalt\n announces the eunuch's arrival, much\nsooner than Tyrion expected. Varys quips that Tyrion was cruel to taunt Pycelle with a secret, but Tyrion accuses\nVarys of the same thing and offers to tell him. Varys suggests his little birds may have already told him: Tyrion\nhopes to dissuade \nDorne\n from joining another faction, even though Prince Doran's hatred for House Lannister is well\nknown. Tyrion points out that much is obvious.\nVarys notes that Prince Doran is a sentimental man who still mourns his murdered sister \nElia\n. Tyrion reveals he has\noffered Doran a council seat and his sister's killer. Varys points out that Ser \nGregor Clegane\n (who is known to have\nmurdered Elia) is a Lannister bannerman, but Tyrion argues that Lord Tywin will agree 50,000 Dornishmen are\nworth one rabid dog. When Varys wonders aloud what might happen if Doran demands the blood of the lord who\ngave the command as well, Tyrion blames Robert Baratheon since it was his rebellion. Varys points out Robert was\nnot at King's Landing, but Tyrion replies that neither was Doran Martell.\nVarys notes that Doran will want a token of good faith as well, and asks who Tyrion will offer. Tyrion turns the\nquestion back on Varys, who declares it must be \nTommen\n since Tyrion cannot offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and\nLysa Arryn both. Varys' uncanny knowledge leads Tyrion to quip that he cheats at guessing games. Varys calls\nTommen a good boy, and Tyrion comments that he might even grow into a good man if they get him away from\nCersei and Joffrey soon enough. Varys acts suspicious that Tyrion might mean to make Tommen king, but Tyrion\ninsists Joffrey is king. Varys points out there is a flaw in the scheme named Cersei, who will never consent to part\nwith both Tommen \nand\n Myrcella. Tyrion says what Cersei does not know will not hurt him. When Varys asks what\nwill happen if she does learn of it, Tyrion declares that he would know the man who told her to be his certain enemy.\nWhen Varys giggles at that, Tyrion thinks to himself, \nThree\n.\nNavigation:\nTyrion III\n↑\nBran II\n ←\nTyrion IV\n→ \nSansa II\n↓\nTyrion V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 18: Sansa II\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n - \nRed Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa I\n↑\nTyrion IV\n ←\nSansa II\n→ \nArya V\n↓\nSansa III\nIn response to a secret note, \nSansa\n takes advantage of a ruckus outside the \nRed Keep\n to sneak to the \ngodswood\n,\nwhere she is disappointed to find \nDontos Hollard\n instead of the dashing knight she prayed for. Nevertheless, Dontos\nsays he has a plan to help her escape and take her home. On her way back, Sansa runs into a drunken \nSandor\nClegane\n, who escorts her back to her chambers.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n has found an anonymous note under her pillow telling her to come to the \ngodswood\n tonight if she wants to go\nhome. She continues reading it over and over, wondering what it could mean. She has prayed so hard for a true\nknight to save her, but perhaps it is only one of \nJoffrey\n's cruel jokes or a clever snare to prove her disloyalty. She\nfears she will only find Ser \nIlyn Payne\n waiting for her with \nIce\n.\nWhen her bedmaid enters unannounced to ask if she wants a bath, Sansa hurriedly hides the note. Worried the girl\nsaw it, Sansa asks for a fire. Once the fire is lit, she orders the girl out and decides there was something sly in her\neyes. Her servants are changed every fortnight to prevent her from befriending one, and Sansa is sure they all spy on\nher. Once alone, she burns the note.\nFrom her window, Sansa sees Ser \nPreston Greenfield\n pacing the drawbridge of \nMaegor's Holdfast\n. She is free to\nroam the whole \nRed Keep\n, but Ser Preston will still ask where she is going at this time of night. Unable to think of a\nlie, Sansa crawls into bed instead, but her thoughts keep her awake. She wishes there was someone to tell her what\nto do. She misses \nSepta\n \nMordane\n and her best friend \nJeyne Poole\n, and even her sister \nArya\n, who she is sure\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_df83c50ed34d90ab4421e37f0520542d859354a9e893680744ddadcd4b058108_v2"}
