Old Nan could not see the comet,\nbut claimed she could smell it and said it foretold \ndragons\n. \nHodor\n only said, “Hodor.”\nStill, the direwolves howl. The guards curse, the hounds bark, the horses kick, the Walders shiver by their fire, and\neven Maester Luwin complains of sleepless nights. Only Bran does not seem to mind. Ser Rodrik has confined the\nwolves to the \ngodswood\n after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell play tricks with sound;\nsometimes wolves sound like they are right below Bran’s window and other times they sound like they are up on the\ncurtain walls. Bran wishes he could see them.\nBran can see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall, the Bell Tower, and the First Keep. Once Bran knew every\nstone of those buildings inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys run\ndown stairs. Their rooftops were his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower were his special friends.\nThen he \nfell\n and almost died. Bran does not remember falling, yet he supposes it must be true. When his eyes fall on\nthe weathered gargoyles atop the First Keep where it happened, Bran gets a tight feeling in his belly. Now he cannot\nclimb, walk, run, or swordfight, and his dreams of \nknighthood\n have soured.\nSummer howled when he fell, and for long after he lay broken, and Shaggydog and \nGrey Wind\n joined in his grief;\n\nRobb\n told him so before he went away to war. The night the bloody raven brought word of his \nfather\n’s death, the\nwolves knew that, too. Bran wonders who the wolves are mourning now. Has some enemy slain the \nKing in the\nNorth\n who used to be his brother Robb? Or has his bastard brother \nJon Snow\n fallen from the Wall? Has his mother\nor one of \nhis\n \nsisters\n died? Or is this something else, as Luwin and Chayle and Old Nan think?\nBran thinks wistfully that if he were a direwolf he would understand. In his wolf dreams he can race up mountains\ntaller than any tower and stand beneath the moon with the entire world below him, as it used to be. Bran cups his\nhands and begins howling like a wolf, hesitantly at first, but Summer gives answer and so he tries again. The noise\nbrings the guard called \nHayhead\n to his door, but Bran only howls at him until he leaves.\nHayhead returns with Maester Luwin, who suggests Bran should be asleep. Bran insists that he is talking to the\nwolves. When Luwin offers Bran assistance getting to bed, Bran insists he can do it himself with the iron bars\nMikken\n installed, but he does not want to sleep. Luwin insists that even princes must sleep, but Bran explains that\nwhen he sleeps he turns into a \nwolf\n. He asks if wolves dream. Luwin thinks so, but not as men dream. Thinking of\nhis father, Bran asks if dead men dream. Maester Luwin says some think so, but the dead are silent on the matter.\nThen Bran asks if trees dream. Confused, Luwin says no, but Bran insists that they do and says he dreams of a\nweirwood\n tree calling to him sometimes. Bran says the wolf dreams are better; he can smell, and sometimes taste the\nblood.\nThis makes Maester Luwin uncomfortable, and he wishes Bran would spend more time with the other children. Bran\ninsists that he hates the other children, meaning the Walders. He reminds Luwin that he commanded them sent\naway. Luwin grows stern as he explains that it is not for Bran to send his mother’s wards away, and asks where they\nwould go if they were turned out. Bran says they can go \nhome\n, since it is their fault he cannot be with Summer.\nLuwin argues that Little Walder did not ask to be attacked, nor did Luwin himself. Bran reminds the maester that\nShaggydog was the attacker; Summer never bit anyone.\nLuwin reminds Bran that Summer tore out a man’s throat in that very room, and claims the sweet pups have grown\ninto dangerous beasts. Bran suggests they should put the Walders in the godswood; the boys can play \nlord of the\ncrossing\n all they want, and Summer can sleep with Bran again. Bran complains that no one listens to him, even\nthough he is the prince. He is not even allowed to ride \nDancer\n past the gate. Luwin insists that the \nwolfswood\n is full\nof dangers, recalling Bran’s \nlast outing\n. Bran insists stubbornly that Summer would protect him and that princes\nshould be free to sail and hunt and joust. Luwin asks why Bran torments himself with these dreams and reminds him\nthat he is a boy of eight. Bran loses his temper and replies:\n“I’d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa.\nI’d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I’d fight beside him like Grey\nWind. I’d tear out the \nKingslayer\n’s throat with my teeth, rip,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITADEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An institution that sent a white raven to announce autumn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>A castle where Bran resides, with godswood and curtain walls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODSWOOD<|>GEO<|>A sacred forest area within Winterfell where the direwolves are confined)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST KEEP<|>GEO<|>A tower in Winterfell where Bran fell and was injured)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUARDS HALL<|>GEO<|>A building in Winterfell where the comet is visible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELL TOWER<|>GEO<|>A tower in Winterfell where the comet is visible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURTAIN WALLS<|>GEO<|>Defensive walls of Winterfell where the sound of wolves echoes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOLFWOOD<|>GEO<|>A forest near Winterfell considered dangerous by Maester Luwin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEIRWOOD<|>GEO<|>A type of tree Bran dreams about, calling to him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAN<|>PERSON<|>A young prince of Winterfell who is paralyzed and dreams of being a wolf)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD NAN<|>PERSON<|>An elderly woman who claims to smell the comet and foretells dragons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HODOR<|>PERSON<|>A simple-minded servant who only says \"Hodor\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAESTER LUWIN<|>PERSON<|>A scholar and advisor at Winterfell who cares for Bran)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER RODRIK<|>PERSON<|>A knight who confined the direwolves to the godswood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBB<|>PERSON<|>Bran's brother who went to war and is the King in the North)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON SNOW<|>PERSON<|>Bran's bastard brother who is at the Wall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAYHEAD<|>PERSON<|>A guard at Winterfell who checks on Bran)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIKKEN<|>PERSON<|>A person who installed iron bars for Bran)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITTLE WALDER<|>PERSON<|>A child at Winterfell who was bitten by Shaggydog)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMMER<|>PERSON<|>Bran's direwolf who howled when Bran fell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAGGYDOG<|>PERSON<|>A direwolf that bit Little Walder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREY WIND<|>PERSON<|>Robb's direwolf who joined in mourning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>Bran's sister who he wishes to find)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>Bran's sister who he wishes to find)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANCER<|>PERSON<|>A horse Bran is not allowed to ride past the gate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING SLAYER<|>PERSON<|>A person Bran wishes to harm in his wolf form)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALL<|>EVENT<|>The incident where Bran fell from the First Keep and was paralyzed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNIGHTHOOD<|>EVENT<|>Bran's former dream of becoming a knight, now impossible due to his injury)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>CITADEL<|>Bran received a white raven from the Citadel announcing autumn<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>WINTERFELL<|>Bran is a prince of Winterfell and resides there<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>GODSWOOD<|>Bran wishes to be in the godswood with his direwolf Summer<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>FIRST KEEP<|>Bran fell from the First Keep and was injured<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>SUMMER<|>Summer is Bran's direwolf who howled when Bran fell<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>SHAGGYDOG<|>Shaggydog is one of the direwolves Bran is connected to<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>GREY WIND<|>Grey Wind is Robb's direwolf, connected to Bran through family<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>ROBB<|>Robb is Bran's brother and the King in the North<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>JON SNOW<|>Jon Snow is Bran's bastard brother at the Wall<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>MAESTER LUWIN<|>Maester Luwin is Bran's advisor and caretaker<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>ARYA<|>Arya is Bran's sister whom he wishes to find<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>SANSA<|>Sansa is Bran's sister whom he wishes to find<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>FALL<|>Bran's fall from the First Keep left him paralyzed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>KNIGHTHOOD<|>Bran's dreams of knighthood were ruined by his injury<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRAN<|>KING SLAYER<|>Bran wishes to harm the Kingslayer in his wolf form<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBB<|>KING IN THE NORTH<|>Robb is the King in the North, Bran's brother<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER<|>BRAN<|>Summer is Bran's direwolf who howls with him<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHAGGYDOG<|>LITTLE WALDER<|>Shaggydog bit Little Walder, leading to confinement<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREY WIND<|>ROBB<|>Grey Wind is Robb's direwolf<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GODSWOOD<|>The godswood is part of Winterfell where the direwolves are kept<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>CURTAIN WALLS<|>The curtain walls are part of Winterfell's defenses<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
