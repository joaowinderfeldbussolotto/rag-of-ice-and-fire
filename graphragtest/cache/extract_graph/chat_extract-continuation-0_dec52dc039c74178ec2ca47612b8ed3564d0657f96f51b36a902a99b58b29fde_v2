She wanders outside and begins to sculpt a snow castle,\nslowly forming it into a replica of \nWinterfell\n. \nLittlefinger\n finds her in the garden and helps her finish the castle. He\ntells her she is even more beautiful than \nher mother\n was at her age, and then proceeds to kiss her. Sansa is shocked\nby Lord Baelish’s action, but for half a heartbeat she yields. She tries to make him stop and then young \nRobert\napproaches interrupting them. Robert begins to destroy the snow castle with his ragged doll. Sansa reacts by\ngrabbing the doll which causes it to tear in half. This in turn causes her cousin to begin shaking violently. Maester\nColemon\n is called to bring the boy for a leeching, in an attempt to cure the fit.\nSansa is brought before her aunt, but \nLysa\n is not concerned about her son’s seizure, but rather Sansa kissing Petyr.\nLysa accuses her of trying to seduce her husband, just like her mother had tried to \"steal\" Petyr from her. Lady\nArryn then relates the story of how one night when they had all gotten drunk, Catelyn spurned Littlefinger, and Lysa\nhad gone to his bed afterward to comfort him, even though he had called her Cat. Lysa continues to rant about how\nher father\n took their baby away from them, and then grabs Sansa and drags her before the \nMoon Door\n while calling\nfor \nMarillion\n. Lysa pushes her closer and closer to the edge, until Littlefinger arrives and tells his new wife to\nrelease her.\nLysa, bordering on insanity, reveals how she had persuaded \nJon Arryn\n to get Littlefinger his first post, and how she\nhad done as he said when Petyr told her to put the \nTears of Lys\n in her husband’s wine. He also had her write the\nletter to her sister falsely naming the \nLannisters\n as Jon Arryn’s murderers. Petyr promises never to leave her side\nagain, and as she falls into his arms, he tells her he has only ever loved one woman... Cat. He then shoves her out the\nMoon Door. He calls for the guards, accusing Marillion of killing his wife…\nNavigation:\nSansa VI\n↑\nJon XII\n ←\nSansa VII\n→ \nEpilogue\n↓\nA Feast for Crows\nSansa I\n\nA Storm of Swords - Epilogue: Epilogue\nPlace(s): \nOldstones\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa VII\n ←\nEpilogue\nSynopsis\nMerrett Frey\n is approaching the ruins of \nOldstones\n with the ransom for his half-brother's (\nStevron Frey\n's) grandson\nPetyr Pimple\n. He is considering all the ill luck throughout his life, starting as a squire, where in a battle against the\nKingswood Brotherhood\n he got hit on the head so hard he was unable to ever truly fight again, which left him\nunable to reach knighthood. \nHis father\n has always mocked him as \"Merrett Muttonhead\", and all he was good for\nduring the \nRed Wedding\n was to drink the \nGreatjon\n under the table.\nMerrett recollects how his father ordered the massacre of the \nStarks\n at \nEdmure Tully\n’s wedding, but it was \nLame\nLothar\n and \nRoose Bolton\n who had masterminded the whole affair. He considers how things at the \nTwins\n will turn\nworse for him when his father dies, as \nRyman\n stands to inherit, and his sons \nEdwyn\n and \nBlack Walder\n after him.\nMerrett feels that if he could accomplish this task, maybe his luck would change for the better, considering that\nPetyr is Ser Ryman’s son. However, he has failed at everything in his life, including his role in keeping the Greatjon\ntoo drunk to fight. The man killed or maimed four men, and it took eight to finally get him in chains.\nWhen he reaches the site of King \nTristifer\n’s sepulcher, he finds the outlaws who captured Petyr. They surround him\nand take the gold he carried for the ransom. Merrett demands to see \nBeric Dondarrion\n, but \nLem\n and \nTom\n inform him\nthat the Lightning Lord was needed elsewhere.
