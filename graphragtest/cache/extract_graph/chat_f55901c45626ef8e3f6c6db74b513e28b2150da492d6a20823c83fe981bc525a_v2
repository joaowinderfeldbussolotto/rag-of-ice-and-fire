As night falls, Daenerys lights the pyre\nand is drawn by instinct deep into the inferno. When the pyre dies, the others find her unburnt and nursing the first\nthree baby \ndragons\n in hundreds of years.\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n and her \nkhas\n build a funeral pyre for \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n, as is \nDothraki\n custom. There is little wood in the land so\nmuch of what they find is gnarled. They lay the logs in a square and fill the center with brush, grass, and bark\nshavings. \nAggo\n and \nRakharo\n kill a stallion from their now meager herd so that Drogo might have a mount in the\nafterlife; it is nowhere near as fine as Drogo’s \nred\n, but there are few in the world that are. \nMirri Maz Duur\n believes\nthat Daenerys is attempting to use bloodmagic to resurrect her \nkhal\n and insists that without the proper spells the\nblood is nothing. The \nmaegi\n even goes so far as to offer assistance in exchange for being released from her bonds,\nbut Daenerys orders her silenced. On the platform they pile Drogo's treasures, but Daenerys does not let the weapons\nshe received as bride gifts be added, insisting they are hers.\nSer \nJorah\n is wary of her intentions, and pleads with her to let Drogo go and come with him to see the wonders of the\neast. Daenerys assures him that she does not plan to sacrifice herself on her husband’s pyre. When Ser Jorah calls\nher “princess”, Daenerys insists that he call her “queen”; her brother, the king, is dead and everything that was his is\nnow hers.\nOnce the pyre is completed, Daenerys gathers her people together, now fewer than a hundred, and declares that they\nwill be her \nkhalasar\n. Among the crowd, she sees slaves and declares them free. She announces that any among them\nare free to go, but that if they stay they shall always have an honored place among her \nkhalasar\n.\nDaenerys turns to the three young warriors of her \nkhas\n and gives each of them one of her bride gifts, naming them\nko\n and asking for their oaths as her \nbloodriders\n: to \nJhogo\n she gives the silver-handled whip, to Aggo the double-\ncurved black dragonbone bow, and to Rakharo the gold-chased \narakh\n. However, none of them are willing to take the\noath: Jhogo replies that this is not done and it would shame him to be a woman's bloodrider, Aggo states that only a\nman can lead a \nkhalasar\n and name a \nko\n, and Rakharo only promises to take her to \nVaes Dothrak\n to join the \ndosh\nkhaleen\n. Daenerys ignores the refusals. Finally, Daenerys turns to Ser Jorah and promises him a fine \nValyrian steel\nblade when she comes into her \nbirthright\n. Ser Jorah swears his fealty and heart to her and Daenerys proclaims him\nthe first of her \nQueensguard\n.\nDaenerys returns to her tent, knowing the Dothraki think her mad and not sure that they are wrong. After a\npleasingly steaming hot bath, she is dried and perfumed. Daenerys sends her handmaids away so that she might\nprepare Drogo for his final journey. She thinks about how few Dothraki men die with their hair uncut as she washes\nhim, braids his hair with bells, and dresses him in fine clothes and the worn vest he liked most. She finally asks him\nto forgive her, and declares that she paid the price, but it was too high. She then dresses in fine clothes with a vest\nlike Drogo’s. The sun is setting when she calls them back to bear Drogo to the pyre.\n\nDaenerys orders oil poured over the pyre, and then orders her handmaidens to fetch her dragon eggs. Something in\nher voice makes them run. Ser Jorah protests that Drogo will have no need of dragon eggs, urging Daenerys to sell\nthem and live as a wealthy woman for the rest of her days. Daenerys insists that the eggs were not given to her to\nsell. Daenerys climbs the pyre to place the black egg under Drogo's arm, near his heart, the green beside his head,\nand the cream-and-gold between his legs. Once the eggs are in place, Daenerys gives her love one last kiss.\nClimbing down, Daenerys notices Mirri Maz Duur watching her and hears the \nmaegi\n call her mad. Daenerys only\nasks how far madness is from wisdom and commands that Mirri Maz Duur be bound to the funeral pyre by Rakharo\nand Ser Jorah, who hesitates and protests. The woman does not scream or plead as she is bound. As she pours the oil\nover the \nmaegi\n’s head, Daenerys thanks her for all she has taught her. Mirri Maz Duur promises that Daenerys will\nnot hear her scream. Daenerys insists that she will, but that she only wants the \nmaegi\n’s life, echoing the woman’s\nown words: “Only death can pay for life.” This brings a flicker of what might\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f55901c45626ef8e3f6c6db74b513e28b2150da492d6a20823c83fe981bc525a_v2"}
