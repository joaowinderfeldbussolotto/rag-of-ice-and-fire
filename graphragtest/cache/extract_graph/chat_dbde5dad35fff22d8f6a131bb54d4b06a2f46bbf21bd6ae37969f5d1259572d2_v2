Suddenly Arya realizes she was\nstupid and that neither \nChiswyck\n nor \nWeese\n mattered. Why didn’t she say Lord Tywin? She hurries to find Jaqen to\ntell him.\nShe hears a shriek of pain, and finds a dozen people looking at the body of Weese with his ugly dog on his chest.\nEvery so often the dog rips a mouthful of flesh off his face. One man exclaims that he had that bitch since it was\npup, and it must be \nHarren’s\n ghost.

She learns that \nRobb\nhas crushed Ser \nStafford Lannister\n’s levies, and that the \nGreatjon\n has seized three of the \nLannisters\n' gold mines.\nRobb reached \nOxcross\n by following a trail \nGrey Wind\n had discovered around the \nGolden Tooth\n. However, Martyn\ntells her that Lord \nTywin\n is marching on Riverrun as they speak. Catelyn makes all haste back to her father \nHoster's\ncastle, but first takes \nBrienne\n as her sworn sword, to prevent the girl from doing anything foolish. Catelyn is fearful\nof her brother \nEdmure's\n chances in battle against Lord Tywin, and outside Riverrun discovers \nLannister men\nhanging from the walls. Edmure informs her that four men from Ser \nCleos's\n party attempted to free Ser \nJaime\n, and\nnearly succeeded. They were hanged for their deeds, and the Kingslayer was placed in the deep dungeons and\nchained to the wall. Her father's steward, \nUtherydes Wayn\n, asks Catelyn if there is no hope of aid from the south,\nhoping that \nStannis Baratheon\n will be forced to make common cause with them, but Catelyn gives no answer, since\n'Stannis has made common cause with '\na power greater and darker\n'.\nEdmure also explains that birds have arrived from \nStorm's End\n, with messages from Ser \nCortnay Penrose\n seeking\nhelp. Cortnay claimed he feared for the boy \nEdric Storm\n, \nRobert's\n only known high-born bastard. Catelyn makes\nknown her dissent in Edmure giving Lord Tywin battle. Her brother has commanded \nRoose Bolton\n to take\nHarrenhal\n, and has also called the levies from the \nTwins\n, those under the command of Ser \nHelman Tallhart\n. Catelyn\nargues that Robb left those men to make certain Lord \nWalder\n kept faith. She learns that Roose wed \none of Lord\nWalder's daughters\n.\nCatelyn then visits her father, but Lord Hoster mistakes her for \nLysa\n, and mumbles several strange, disjointed lines,\n\"\nJon\n’s a good man…strong, kind…you’ll wed when Catelyn does…That stripling…wretched boy…not speak that\nname to me, your duty…\". Catelyn is then led by Utherydes to the \nsilent sisters\n who possess Lord \nEddard's\n bones.\nWhen she states that she must thank \nCersei\n for even this much, her father's steward tells her to thank the \nImp\n, since\nit was his doing. Catelyn thinks to herself \"One day I will thank them all\".\nCatelyn commands the silent sisters to lay Ned's bones to rest in the \ncrypts of Winterfell\n, and then asks to be left\nalone with her husband's body, musing that she envies the silent sisters for their supposed ability to speak to the\ndead.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn IV\n↑\nArya VIII\n ←\nCatelyn V\n→ \nDaenerys III\n↓\nCatelyn VI\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 40: Daenerys III\nPlace(s): \nQarth\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys II\n↑\nCatelyn V\n ←\nDaenerys III\n→ \nTyrion IX\n↓\nDaenerys IV\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n relates to \nXaro Xhoan Daxos\n how the \nPureborn\n have denied her, despite all the customary bribes and\ntraditional proceedings she followed. Daenerys' hope of obtaining ships and men from the Pureborn was in vain, and\nnow she has to move on. The Pureborn are interested only in her dragons, not in her cause. She again beseeches\nXaro for ships, but the merchant prince tells her he has no warships. He asks her again to marry him, and she again\nrefuses. She considers going to the \nWarlocks\n for aid, and again Xaro warns her not to.
