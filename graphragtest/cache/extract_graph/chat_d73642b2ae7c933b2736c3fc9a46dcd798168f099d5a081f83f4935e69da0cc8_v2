Ser Jorah explains that the \nDothraki\nfollow only the strong; the \nkhalasar\n will not follow a baby. Instead, the \nko\ns will fight for the leadership and her baby\nwill be killed as a challenge to their authority. Daenerys insists that her \nkhas\n and Drogo’s bloodriders will keep her\nchild safe, but Jorah reminds her that the bloodriders' last duty is only to return her to the \ndosh khaleen\n in \nVaes\nDothrak\n and then follow their \nkhal\n. Daenerys does not want to return to join the \ndosh khaleen\n, but she also refuses to\nleave Drogo.\nMirri Maz Duur arrives with Qotho, looking exhausted. Both Qotho and \nHaggo\n, taking one look at Drogo, blame the\ngodwife and start beating her. When Daenerys demands that they stop, Qotho threatens to take Daenerys out to be\nraped along with the \nmaegi\n. Ser Jorah intervenes and eventually the bloodriders leave.\nAfter they leave, Ser Jorah explains that the bloodriders die with their \nkhal\n and are now beyond fear because they\nsee their death approaching. Daenerys tells Ser Jorah to don his armor. Once the knight has left, Daenerys tells Mirri\nMaz Duur to heal Drogo. The godswife states that he is beyond help and will be gone by morning. Daenerys pleads\nwith her, insisting that there must be a way, a magical way. Mirri Maz Duur admits she does know some dark magic\nlearned at great cost from a bloodmage from the \nShadow Lands\n; it will cost a life. Daenerys asks if it means her life,\n\nbut Mirri Maz Duur assures her it does not.\nThey lower Drogo into a bath and bring his stallion into the tent. \nJhogo\n pleads with Daenerys not to use forbidden\nbloodmagic and to allow him to kill the \nmaegi\n. It takes \nRakharo\n, \nQuaro\n, and \nAggo\n to force the frightened stallion to\nthe tub while Mirri Maz Duur chants. The godswife uses a red bronze knife covered in glyphs to cut the horse’s\nthroat and fill the tub with blood. The godswife then orders Daenerys, who is now filled with fear, to leave the tent;\nno one must look upon the old and dark powers the godswife’s spell will wake. Outside, the gathered crowd stares at\nher. When Ser Jorah, now in his armor, sees the bloody footprints Daenerys leaves he asks what foolish thing she\nhas done.\nDaenerys can hear the \nmaegi’s\n voice and see the shadows moving inside the tent. The Dothraki start to mutter and\ndraw back. Drogo’s bloodriders return with the healing eunuchs. When Qotho sees what is happening he moves\ntoward the tent, intending to kill Mirri Maz Duur and then Daenerys. He pushes Daenerys aside as she tries to\ninterfere and she screams for her \nkhas\n to stop him. Quaro is quickly cut down, but Ser Jorah steps forward to\nconfront Qotho. Without his helmet, the knight is hard pressed by Qotho’s rapid strikes. Then Qotho’s \narakh\n cuts\ninto Ser Jorah’s hip and catches on the bone, giving Ser Jorah the opportunity to kill him.\nMeanwhile, the other bloodriders and members of Daenerys’ \nkhas\n have also come to battle. Jhogo’s whip catches\nHaggo\n around the neck, giving Rakharo the chance to kill him. Daenerys is hemorrhaging from the birth of her child\nand crawling toward the tent, screaming that the price is too high. The bloodrider \nCohollo\n catches her and is about to\nkill her when \nAggo\n’s arrow takes him in the chest.\nWhen Daenerys raises her head again, the crowd is dispersing. Some are saddling horses and riding off as the sun\nsets. She cannot rise and the shadows are whirling inside the tent. Ser Jorah comes to assist her and calls for her\nhandmaids to get the birthing women. \nDoreah\n informs him that they believe Daenerys is cursed and are gone. Then\nshe hears someone (possibly Aggo) telling them to take her to the \nmaegi\n. Daenerys knows she does not want to go\ninto the tent, but cannot speak. \nIrri\n and Doreah both agree that they heard Mirri Maz Duur say she knows about\nbirthing.\nSer Jorah carries Daenerys into the tent.\nNavigation:\nDaenerys VII\n↑\nCatelyn X\n ←\nDaenerys VIII\n→ \nArya V\n↓\nDaenerys IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 65: Arya V\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya IV\n↑\nDaenerys VIII\n ←\nArya V\n→ \nBran VII\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nArya I\nArya\n is surviving on the streets of \nKing's Landing\n by hunting pigeons.
