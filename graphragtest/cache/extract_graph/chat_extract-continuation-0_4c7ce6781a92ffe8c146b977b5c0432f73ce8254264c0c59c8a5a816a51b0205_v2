Unable to think of a\nlie, Sansa crawls into bed instead, but her thoughts keep her awake. She wishes there was someone to tell her what\nto do. She misses \nSepta\n \nMordane\n and her best friend \nJeyne Poole\n, and even her sister \nArya\n, who she is sure is back\nin \nWinterfell\n by now.\nHearing shouting, Sansa looks out to see armed men running to the wall and Ser Preston gone from the drawbridge.\nWondering what she is doing, Sansa dresses quickly and hides her meat knife under her cloak. After darting across\nthe undefended drawbridge, she passes men arming in the yard and sees three \nKingsguard\n helping Joffrey into his\narmor. Fortunately, Joffrey is busy calling for his weapons and does not see her.\nThe sounds fade as Sansa rushes towards the godswood, never daring to look back for fear of Joffrey. The godswood\nis quiet and there is a wild feel to it even in the heart of the city, and Sansa can feel the \nold gods\n watching her. She\nprefers \nher mother\n's \ngods\n--with their artwork, incense, rainbows, and rich fabrics and gems--but the godswood has a\ncertain power too, especially by night.\nFearing she is too late, Sansa is surprised by the voice of \nDontos Hollard\n saying he feared she would not come.\nWhen he reaches for her, Sansa shrinks back and reaches for her knife. Dontos insists he only wants to help her as\nshe helped him. Sansa asks if he is drunk and Dontos admits he had a cup of wine to help his courage. Drawing her\nknife, Sansa asks who sent him. Dontos swears on his knight's honor that he came on his own, but Sansa recalls\nJoffrey's decree and says she prayed for a knight to save her, not a drunken old fool. Dontos accepts the rebuke, but\nsays he hopes to find it in himself to be a knight again because of her, adding that Sansa not only saved him from\nJoffrey, but also from himself.\nDontos reminds her that \nFlorian\n was both a fool and the greatest knight of all. He falls to his knees and asks to be\n\nher Florian. Still unsure, Sansa asks how he plans for her to escape. Dontos explains that the hardest part will be\ngetting her out of the castle. Then a ship could take her home, but he needs to find coin and make arrangements\nwithout raising suspicions, which will take time since he is also watched. When Sansa puts away her knife, Dontos\nrises and laments that he did nothing to save \nher father\n. He then declares that he is not a hero like \nRyam Redwyne\n or\nBarristan Selmy\n and has won no glory in war or tourney, but Sansa has reminded him what it is to be a knight. He\npledges himself to her and vows to the old gods that he will send her home.\nAssured by his solemn oath, Sansa agrees to put herself in his hands. Then she asks if he will send another letter to\nlet her know when, but he says that would be too dangerous. Instead, he instructs her to come to the godswood as\noften as possible since nowhere else is safe. She agrees, and promises to be brave, strong, and patient above all.\nDontos urges her to leave, and Sansa kisses him softly on the cheek and calls him, \"My Florian,\" certain that the\ngods have heard her prayer.\nOn her way back, giddily thinking about home and the songs about Florian and \nJonquil\n, Sansa caroms into \nSandor\nClegane\n. The Hound catches her before she can fall and asks if she wants to kill them both on the serpentine steps.\nWhen he asks what she is doing out so late, Sansa stutters that she was praying for her father and the king. The\nHound replies that he is not drunk enough to believe that story, adding that although she is nearly a woman, Sansa is\nstill just a little bird singing the songs they taught her. He mockingly asks her to sing him a song about knights and\nfair maids, and asks if she likes knights. Sansa answers \ntrue\n knights, but the Hound mocks her and reminds her he is\nnot a knight at all. Reeling and almost falling, the Hound curses that he had too much wine, then offers to take Sansa\nback to her chambers. He pushes her gently and follows her down the steps.\nUpon their return, they find Ser \nBoros Blount\n guarding the drawbridge. Sansa flinches away, but the Hound insists\nBlount is not to be feared. When Ser Boros asks why she is not in her chambers, Sansa's lie about the godswood\nsounds more convincing than before. The Hound adds that she could not be expected to sleep with all the noise. Ser\nBoros explains that preparations for \nTyrek Lannister\n's wedding feast have convinced some wretches that they should\nfeast, too. He adds that Joffrey led a sortie that sent the fools scurrying. Clegane states, \"A brave boy,\" but Sansa\nwonders how brave Joffrey will be when he faces her brother \nRobb\n.\nAfter crossing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RED KEEP<|>GEO<|>A castle where Sansa resides and interacts with various characters, including Ser Preston and the Kingsguard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER PRESTON<|>PERSON<|>A guard at the Red Keep who questions Sansa's movements at night)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANSA<|>PERSON<|>A young woman in the Red Keep who misses her family and friends, including Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTA MORDANE<|>PERSON<|>A mentor or guardian figure whom Sansa misses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEYNE POOLE<|>PERSON<|>Sansa's best friend whom she misses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>Sansa's sister who is believed to be in Winterfell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>The ancestral home of Sansa and Arya, where Arya is believed to have returned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGSGUARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An elite group of knights who protect the king and are seen helping Joffrey into his armor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>A prince or king who is being armed by the Kingsguard and is feared by Sansa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONTOS HOLLARD<|>PERSON<|>A knight who offers to help Sansa escape and claims to be inspired by her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORIAN<|>PERSON<|>A legendary knight referenced by Dontos as both a fool and a great knight)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RYAM REDWYNE<|>PERSON<|>A heroic knight mentioned by Dontos as an example of true knighthood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARRISTAN SELMY<|>PERSON<|>A renowned knight referenced by Dontos as a symbol of glory in war and tourneys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDOR CLEGANE<|>PERSON<|>Also known as the Hound, a warrior who mocks Sansa and offers to escort her back to her chambers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JONQUIL<|>PERSON<|>A character from songs about Florian, referenced by Sansa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER BOROS BLOUNT<|>PERSON<|>A knight guarding the drawbridge who questions Sansa's whereabouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYREK LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>A person whose wedding feast preparations are causing disturbances in the Red Keep)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBB<|>PERSON<|>Sansa's brother whom she believes Joffrey will eventually face)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>RED KEEP<|>Sansa resides in the Red Keep and interacts with its inhabitants<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SER PRESTON<|>Ser Preston questions Sansa's movements at night<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SEPTA MORDANE<|>Sansa misses Septa Mordane, indicating a past relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JEYNE POOLE<|>Jeyne Poole is Sansa's best friend whom she misses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>ARYA<|>Arya is Sansa's sister whom she believes is in Winterfell<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Winterfell is Sansa's ancestral home where she wishes to return<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>KINGSGUARD<|>The Kingsguard are seen arming Joffrey, whom Sansa fears<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>JOFFREY<|>Joffrey is a figure of fear for Sansa, and she avoids him<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>DONTOS HOLLARD<|>Dontos offers to help Sansa escape and pledges himself to her<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONTOS HOLLARD<|>FLORIAN<|>Dontos compares himself to Florian, a legendary knight<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SANDOR CLEGANE<|>Sandor Clegane mocks Sansa but also escorts her back to her chambers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>SER BOROS BLOUNT<|>Ser Boros questions Sansa's whereabouts at the drawbridge<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>TYREK LANNISTER<|>Tyrek Lannister's wedding feast preparations indirectly affect Sansa's environment<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANSA<|>ROBB<|>Robb is Sansa's brother whom she believes will confront Joffrey<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
