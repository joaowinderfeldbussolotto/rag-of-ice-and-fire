Renly even swears to bring her \nCersei Lannister\n's head when he takes \nKing's Landing\n, but Catelyn\nreplies that justice will be enough. Brienne of Tarth notes that Catelyn should kneel and refer to the king as \"Your\nGrace,\" but Catelyn insists they have more pressing matters to discuss. Some of Renly's lords bristle, but the king\nonly laughs and asks when Robb plans to march on Harrenhal. Unsure whether Renly will be a friend or a foe,\nCatelyn only replies that she does not sit on the war council. Renly asks about \nJaime Lannister\n and, learning he is a\nprisoner, declares that the direwolf is gentler than the lion. Lord Randyll Tarly pipes up that Robb should have come\nto pay homage in person, but Catelyn counters that her son is fighting a war, not playing at one. Renly grins and\nwarns Lord Tarly that he is outmatched, then offers Catelyn the use of his own pavilion (since he is guesting at Lord\nLorent Caswell\n's castle) and invites her to the evening's farewell feast.\nRenly's pavilion is so massive and richly furnished that Catelyn understands why his host moves so slowly, and that\nevening she is seated between Mathis Rowan and Ser \nJon Fossoway\n. Meanwhile, Brienne of Tarth is seated at the\nfar end of the high table in knight's garments instead of a lady's and Catelyn notes that out of her armor Brienne\nlooks muscular, plain, and ungainly, and judges from the woman's actions that she knows it.\nSingers and tumblers entertain them, and the food is rich and plentiful, but Catelyn eats only sparingly and watches\nthose around her. King Renly speaks amiably to all and sometimes feeds Queen Margaery choice morsels or kisses\nher lightly, but it is Ser Loras who shares most in his jests and confidences. Others are less moderate: the brothers\nJosua\n and \nElyas Willum\n dispute who will be first over the walls of King's Landing, Lord \nVarner\n dandles a serving\ngirl, Ser \nGuyard Morrigen\n sings a bad song about knotting lions' tails, Ser \nMark Mullendore\n feeds his pet \nmonkey\nfrom his plate, and Ser \nTanton Fossoway\n climbs onto the table and swears to slay \nSandor Clegane\n in single combat.\nWhen a gold-dressed fool and a dwarf elicit gales of laughter by mocking Jaime and \nTyrion Lannister\n, Lord Rowan\nremarks to Catelyn that Renly and his favorites are all very young. Seeing Lord \nBryce Caron\n goad Ser \nRobar Royce\ninto juggling daggers, Catelyn recalls that none of them are old enough to have seen war, so they think it is a game\nand believe themselves immortal. She tells Lord Rowan that war will make them old, as it did her generation, and\nsays she pities them because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming. Brienne chimes in to disagree,\nsaying:\nWinter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it’s always\nsummer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.\n\nCatelyn knows that winter comes for everyone, as it did for her when Ned died, but King Renly saves her from\nhaving to say so by asking her to take the air with him. Brienne wants to come along as well, but Renly insists\nanother sword will make no difference in the midst of his own army. Brienne seems very hurt by the refusal.\nAs they walk, Renly asks if Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n has joined Robb at Riverrun. When Catelyn seems puzzled, Renly\ntells her of Selmy's dismissal and his vow to serve the true king, adding that Brienne's position in the Rainbow\nGuard was meant for Selmy. Next, Renly explains that he offered Ned a hundred swords to seize Joffrey but fled\nwhen refused because he lacked the strength to act alone and feared Cersei meant to kill him after Robert died. He\nadds that he liked Ned well enough and knew him to be Robert's loyal friend, but says Ned would not listen or bend.\nLeading her out onto the roof, Renly shows Catelyn his army's countless campfires and asks how many fires burn\naround Riverrun. He guesses that Robb has 40,000 men at most, though Catelyn knows the real number is much\nlower. Renly declares that he has twice as many with him, and another 10,000 with \nMace Tyrell\n at Highgarden, a\nstrong garrison at \nStorm's End\n, and soon all the power of \nDorne\n and his brother \nStannis Baratheon\n on \nDragonstone\n.\nCatelyn counters sharply that Renly seems to have forgotten that Stannis has the better claim. Renly replies that\nStannis is respected and feared but not loved and would make an appalling king. Gesturing to his army, Renly\ndeclares that his claim is as good as Robert's ever was.\nThen he offers terms: Robb can rule in Winterfell and even go on calling himself King in the North, but he
