His\nfather’s former ward informs him that he must make the people of \nWinterfell\n aware that Theon is in command, and\nthat no one will be hurt if they concede. Bran watches as all those whom \nJojen\n saw in his dream die, and all of the\ncrannogman’s words have come true. \nThe sea has come to Winterfell\n, and Mikken drowns on his own blood as he\nrefuses to bend the knee. Most in the castle defy Theon, but \nReek\n and \nOsha\n join his service. Bran is disappointed\nabout the latter, but manages to convince the rest that fighting is not the answer.\nNavigation:\nBran V\n↑\nCatelyn VI\n ←\nBran VI\n→ \nArya IX\n↓\nBran VII\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 47: Arya IX\nPlace(s): \nHarrenhal\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya VIII\n↑\nBran VI\n ←\nArya IX\n→ \nDaenerys IV\n↓\nArya X\nThe \nBloody Mummers\n bring 100 northmen to \nHarrenhal\n as prisoners. \nArya\n sees this as an opportunity to free the\nmen, \ntake over the castle\n, and escape. \nGendry\n refuses to help her, but when she meets \nJaqen H'ghar\n, she is able to\npersuade him and they free the men together. Arya is forced to take on yet another pseudonym, Nan, and is named\nRoose Bolton\n's cupbearer.\nSynopsis\nArya\n and \nHot Pie\n are eating tarts in the kitchens when the \nBloody Mummers\n return, this time with nearly 100\nnorthmen\n as prisoners, along with their lord commander, \nRobett Glover\n, and \nAenys Frey\n. \nVargo Hoat\n claims that\nLord \nRoose Bolton\n fled with his host after the battle. Ser \nAmory Lorch\n has the men imprisoned in the \nWidow's\nTower\n. Arya tries to convince \nGendry\n to help her free the northmen, but the apprentice smith is happy enough where\nhe is and wants no part of it. Arya later goes to the \ngodswood\n to practise with a wooden stick, and she meets \nJaqen\nH'ghar\n there. The \nLorathi\n tells her he would have done with his promise, and asks her to name a third. He also\nknows her to be Arya Stark, and tells her that some people have many names. She asks him to help her free the\nnorthmen, but Jaqen reminds her that she has only one name left. When Arya asks if she could name anybody, even\nthe king\n, Jaqen tells her, \"Speak the name, and death will come. On the morrow, at the turn of the moon, a year from\nthis day, it will come. A man does not fly…but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there, and a\nking dies.\" Arya whispers \"Jaqen H’ghar\", and stuns the man. But Jaqen is unafraid, and a dagger appears in his\nhand, telling her she would lose her only friend. Arya says that a friend would help her, and Jaqen agrees to help her\nif she names another name. They go and find \nRorge\n and \nBiter\n, and Jaqen tells her, \"The hungry gods will feast on\nblood tonight, if a man would do this thing\", but Arya is resolute.\nJaqen brings Arya along, and has her demand several kettles of hot soup from the cooks. Each man takes one of the\nhuge kettles, with Rorge carrying two, and they invade the tower where the prisoners are kept. Boiling soup flies\neverywhere as the guards are dispatched, and when Rorge unlocks the door to the cells, Robett Glover thanks them\nand asks if they are from the Brave Companions. Arya is confused, but has no time to ask him what he meant when\nfighting breaks out in the great castle. Jaqen wipes blood from his sword on Arya’s shift, telling her this is her work.\nLater, Arya takes back the name, and asks if she still can name a third, but Jaqen responds that she has gotten far\nmore than three deaths. As she watches, Jaqen tells her the debt is paid and that he must die, and his features change\nas he passes a hand over his face. Arya asks who he is and if she could learn to do the same, but Jaqen tells her she\nwould need to go with him across the \nnarrow sea\n. He leaves her with a coin, of great value in the right place, and\ntells her that if she ever needs to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from \nBraavos\n, and say \n\"\nvalar\nmorghulis\n\"\n. Jaqen, who claims his name is as dead as Arry, then disappears into the night.\nLord Roose Bolton arrives in the aftermath of the \nfall of Harrenhal\n, and Vargo Hoat turns the castle over to him. The\nprisoners were all a ruse to begin with, and apparently Bolton had bought the services of the Qohorik sellsword.
