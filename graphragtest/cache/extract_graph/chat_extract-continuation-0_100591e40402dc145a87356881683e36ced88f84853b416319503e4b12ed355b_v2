Will has reported on wildlings that he found, claiming they are all dead. Gared, an older man\nwho has been in the Night's Watch for decades, is uneasy, and insists that they turn back to the \nWall\n; they have eight\nor nine days of travel ahead of them, which can turn into a fortnight if it snows. Waymar, a noble born youth of\neighteen, however, has the command, and after making light of Gared's fears asks Will again for the details of what\nhe saw.\nWill explains that he saw the wildlings' encampment. Their lean-to was covered by snow, they had no fire, and none\nof the wildlings moved the entire time he was watching. They were lying on the ground as if dead, but no blood was\nvisible. Waymar suggests they might have been sleeping, but Will insists they are dead. There was also a woman up\nin a tree, but she did not move either. Gared suggests the wildlings must have been killed by the cold, but Waymar\npoints out that the weather has not been cold enough to freeze men like that. He asks Will to lead them to the dead\nwildlings.\nWith night falling, the rangers ride back to the wildling camp. Both Will and Gared sense something is wrong, but\nWaymar mocks them again and commands Gared to stay behind to guard the \nhorses\n. When Gared suggests starting a\nfire, Waymar sardonically orders him not to. Will fears that Waymar's insolence will provoke Gared into drawing\nhis sword, but Gared eventually acquiesces and no fire is lit.\nWill and Waymar climb up the ridge, Waymar much noisier than Will. When Will reaches his previous vantage\npoint, he sees that the bodies are gone. Waymar, walking upright, reaches the top of the ridge and stands in plain\nsight. Will warns Waymar to get down, but Waymar just laughs. Determined to find the wildlings and make his first\nranging a success, Waymar orders Will to climb a tree and look for a fire.\nWill reluctantly climbs a nearby \nsentinel\n tree. Below him, Waymar challenges an unseen foe. Will thinks he sees a\nwhite shadow moving below, but is not sure. He is about to call down a warning, but stops, unsure. Waymar calls to\nWill with unease in his voice as he turns in a circle with his sword drawn, and asks about the sudden cold, which\nWill also feels.\nAn \nOther\n emerges from the woods: tall, gaunt, and white, dappled with a gray-green shimmer. Waymar nervously\ncommands it to come no further and prepares himself for battle, challenging the Other to \"dance\" with him. Will\nnotes that Waymar, in that moment, is no longer a boy, but truly a man of the Night's Watch. When more Others\nappear among the trees, Will considers calling out a warning, but decides not to do so, as it would require him to\nreveal his position. The sword of the first Other is made of inhumanly-sharp translucent crystal. Waymar is able to\ncheck the oncoming blows until his parry comes a bit too late and the Other's sword cuts through the mail under his\narm. Waymar screams \"For \nRobert\n!\" and charges, but as his blade strikes the Other's sword, it shatters. One of the\nshards hits Waymar's left eye and he falls to his knees, blinded. All of the Others move in and slash at him\nmercilessly.\nWill turns his head away for a long time before looking back to see that the Others are gone. When he finally dares,\nWill climbs down, examines Royce's body, then picks up the knight's twisted and broken sword. He decides to bring\nit back to show to their commanders, hoping Gared is still with the horses. When Will stands up again, Waymar \nhas\n\nrisen\n and is standing over him. His remaining eye has turned blue. With an icy cold touch, Waymar's hands go\naround Will's throat.\nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nBran I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 1: Bran I\nPlace(s): \nNorth of \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nPrologue\n ←\nBran I\n→ \nCatelyn I\n↓\nBran II\nLord \nEddard Stark\n dispenses justice to a \nNight's Watch\n deserter.
