Outside the \nYunkai\n are massing more ships,\nbuilding siege weapons to throw rocks at the city. However, no rams or siege towers are built, as the siege is\nintended to cause famine and disease to force Meereen to succumb.\nDaario introduces Dany to the three \nDornishmen\n who say that they have specific gifts for the queen. \nQuentyn\nMartell\n, \nGerris Drinkwater\n, and \nArchibald Yronwood\n, who defected to Daario, reveal themselves to her. A\nparchment is presented, \ndescribing a secret pact of alliance\n between Dorne and the Targaryens signed by \nWillem\nDarry\n and \nOberyn Martell\n, that would be sealed by a marriage between \nViserys\n and \nArianne Martell\n. Dany laughs\nwhen she learns who Quentyn is, as his mercenary nickname was Frog, and she remembers the story of a frog\nturning into a prince.\nDany remembers \nQuaithe\n's earlier prophecy. \nThe glass Candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after\nher the others. Kraken and Dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them.\nRemember the Undying.

They are accompanied by \nTycho Nestoris\n, an emissary of the \nIron Bank of Braavos\n. \nJon\n warns Selyse that\nthe Nightfort is still mostly in ruins and advises her that they may be most comfortable at \nEastwatch-by-the-Sea\n.\nThe queen says that they are not safe there and insists on going to the Nightfort. Then, \nWun Wun\n appears, startling\nthe ladies. The giant speaks a few kind words, but mangles them. Jon tells the women he is only just learning the\nCommon Tongue\n as all giants speak the \nOld Tongue\n. Wun Wun's laugh startles and frightens the group, causing \nSer\nPatrek\n to draw his sword. Jon warns him to never draw his sword against a giant as he is protected by guest rights\nhere, which Jon says they still honor in the north, though the south may not.\nJon then offers to give Tycho a tour atop the Wall, but he prefers to speak with Jon now, preferably in a warm room.\nTycho tells Jon that the \nIron Throne\n has ceased all debt payments to the Iron Bank. Jon thinks this must be madness\non the part of the \nLannisters\n. He thinks that the Iron Bank may want to support \nStannis\n in his war to ensure that the\ndebt is eventually payed. Jon asks for a favour: to borrow ships and a loan to keep the \nNight's Watch\n fed until\nspring. Tycho says this is impossible, but after a few hours of drinking and haggling they strike a deal.\nWith the three ships added to the Eastwatch fleet, Jon counts that they now have eleven ships. He hopes to bring the\nwildlings\n down from \nHardhome\n around the Wall in order to save them and not have them become more \nwights\n in\nthrall to \nThe Others\n. However, he is unsure if \nMother Mole\n will be desperate enough to trust her people to the men\nof the \nNight's Watch\n.\nHe discusses things further with Tycho; he asks after \nMaester Aemon\n, \nGilly\n and \nSam\n but Tycho knows nothing and\nJon can merely hope they have reached \nOldtown\n. They talk about an unknown fleet prowling the narrow sea and\nrumours of \ndragons\n coming from the east, Jon joking that a dragon would warm things up. Tycho says sternly that\nhis people\n are descended from those who fled the dragonlords of \nValyria\n and they do not joke lightly about such, so\nJon apologizes.\nThey make their way to the common hall, where Axell Florent asks Jon to see \nVal\n. Jon surmises that he must know\nthe woman is gone. He then excuses himself and leaves, pondering the dangers of the agreement with Tycho,\nuncertain if the Watch will ever be able to repay the Iron Bank and thus avoid consequences. But Jon knows that\nbetween being bankrupt and dead, he made the right choice.
