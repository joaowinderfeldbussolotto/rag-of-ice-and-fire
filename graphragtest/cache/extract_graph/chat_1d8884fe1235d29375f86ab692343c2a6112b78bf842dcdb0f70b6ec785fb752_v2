The corpse of\nSmall \nPaul\n comes after Sam, and he tries to stab it with the \nobsidian\n dagger, but it shatters upon contact with Paul’s\nchainmail. Despairing, Sam thrusts a burning stick from the campfire in the wight’s mouth, setting it on fire. Outside\nthe hut, the wights begin to surround Gilly and her infant son after killing their horse. Thinking all is lost, a raven\nlands on Sam’s shoulder, and suddenly thousands of ravens fly from the branches of the \nweirwood\n tree to tear the\nwights to pieces.
