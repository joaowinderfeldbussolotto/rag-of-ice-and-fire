She never expected someone to\ninform her father of the plan, nor for \nHotah\n to intercept them, and certainly not \nGerold Dayne\n's unprovoked attack\non \nMyrcella\n. Dayne escaped from Hotah's men, but he left a terrible scar on Myrcella's face, barely missing a\nbeheading stroke as was his apparent intent. Thinking her father would see her within a day, Arianne becomes\ndistraught as days turn into weeks, and although servants come and go with food, none will speak to her. She\nconsiders who could have betrayed her, ponders her feelings at the loss of \nSer Arys\n, and thinks of her close\nrelationship with \nTyene\n. She eventually persuades the young serving girl \nCedra\n to deliver a letter to Lord \nFowler\n,\nknowing that the girl has feelings for \nGarin\n (who, Arianne assumes, is imprisoned at \nGhaston Grey\n along with her\nother co-conspirators). But the next day, Cedra does not return, and Arianne never sees her again during her\nimprisonment.\nAfter an indeterminate period of agonized waiting, Areo Hotah arrives to bring her before her father. Prince \nDoran\nasks her why, to which Arianne replies, \"For the honor of our \nHouse\n.\" The Prince tells her they have not caught\nDayne, but the damage he did to Myrcella, a ward of their house, has done naught but bring the Martells dishonor.\nHe cautions her that a war with the \nIron Throne\n is the last thing they need. Although the \nYoung Dragon\n wrote that\nDorne\n was populous, his memoirs were written to portray himself in a better light. Prince Doran admits that Dorne is\nactually the least populous of the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, and could not survive open war with the Throne. He admits it\nwas a mistake not to have had her taken prior to running off with Myrcella, but he will not reveal who betrayed her.\nWhen he tells her that she disappoints him, Arianne retorts, \"You have been disappointing me for years, Father.\"\nPrince Doran discloses that none of her co-conspirators are imprisoned. Instead, he has sent Ser \nAndrey Dalt\n to\nNorvos\n to serve Arianne's mother; Garin is in \nTyrosh\n for two years; and \nSylva\n was sent to \nGreenstone\n to marry Lord\nEldon Estermont\n. He goes on to remark that Arianne and her cousins may get the war they wanted, as Ser \nBalon\nSwann\n is on his way to \nSunspear\n. The Prince has several of his bannermen stalling him, but eventually Ser Balon\nwill discover that his brother in the \nKingsguard\n, Ser \nArys\n, is dead and Myrcella maimed. Arianne continues to taunt\nher father, and he cautions her that he is out of patience. But the princess is unimpressed, remarking, \"For Lord\nTywin\n you always had the forbearance of \nBaelor the Blessed\n, but for your own blood, none.\" He responds, \"You\nmistake patience for forbearance. I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of\nElia\n and her children.\"\nWhen Arianne tells him that she wants her rights to Dorne, Prince Doran finally reveals that she will have the\nkingdom when he passes. Arianne divulges that she knew of his scheme to make \nQuentyn\n his heir, but her father\ntells her that he had other plans for her. He offered her hand to old men because he knew she would rebuke them,\nbut he had to be seen as trying. All along, he had promised her to Prince \nViserys\n, but now that the last male\nTargaryen is dead, he has no reason to deny her her right to Dorne. He finishes by saying, \"We princes make our\ncareful plans and the gods smash them all awry.\" His original plan was to send her to Tyrosh to serve as the\nArchon's cupbearer, where she could meet her betrothed in secret, while her brother Quentyn was being raised to\nassume the seat of their House. Finally he reveals why her brother is overseas: to bring back their heart's desire.\nWhen Arianne asks what that is, her father replies, \"Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood.\"\n\nNavigation:\nThe Queenmaker\n↑\nCersei IX\n ←\nThe Princess in the Tower\n→ \nAlayne II\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 41: Alayne II\nPlace(s): \nthe \nEyrie\n - the \nGates of the Moon\n \n \nNavigation:\nAlayne I\n↑\nThe Princess in the Tower\n ←\nAlayne II\n→ \nBrienne VIII\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6f8520591d4f26a18cc3902a854feef70f233e1979de774f89dc8866ac7e9c48_v2"}
