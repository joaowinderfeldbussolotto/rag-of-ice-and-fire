Renly replies that\nStannis is respected and feared but not loved and would make an appalling king. Gesturing to his army, Renly\ndeclares that his claim is as good as Robert's ever was.\nThen he offers terms: Robb can rule in Winterfell and even go on calling himself King in the North, but he must\nbend the knee to Renly as his overlord. When Catelyn asks the consequences of refusal, Renly insists he means to be\nking of a united realm and reminds her that \nTorrhen Stark\n was wise to yield to \nAegon I Targaryen\n, adding that if\nthey join together the war is good as done.\nJust then, a messenger rides into the yard with news that \nStorm's End\n is under attack, although Ser \nCortnay Penrose\ndefies the besiegers. When Renly protests that he would know if Lord Tywin had left Harrenhal, the messenger\nreplies that these are no Lannisters; it Lord Stannis at the gates, calling himself \nKing\n Stannis.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn I\n↑\nBran III\n ←\nCatelyn II\n→ \nJon III\n↓\nCatelyn III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 23: Jon III\nPlace(s): \nCraster's Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon II\n↑\nCatelyn II\n ←\nJon III\n→ \nTheon II\n↓\nJon IV\nThe \nNight's Watch\n finally finds people at \nCraster's Keep\n. \nCraster\n has been an ally to the Watch, but he has an\nunsavory reputation. \nJon Snow\n discovers that Craster marries his daughters and gives his young sons to the Cold\nGods. Jon gets the opportunity to talk to one of Craster’s wives, \nGilly\n, about this, and learns that the Cold Gods have\nbright blue eyes like the \nwights\n that attacked \nJeor Mormont\n. The next day, Jon rides with the Lord Commander,\ntelling him about Craster’s sons and daughters, and learns that the commander knew. Then the commander tells him\nthat Craster informed them that \nMance Rayder\n is gathering his people at \nFrostfangs\n.\nSynopsis\nJon Snow\n is riding beside a grumpy \nLord Commander\n with an equally soaked and grumpy raven on his shoulder.\nThere have been six days of rain, and the ground is treacherous; Jon thinks about \nPypar\n and \nTodder\n sitting near the\nfire in the common room. The Lord Commander is relieved when he hears \nJarmen Buckwell\n’s horn—it means there\nare still people at \nCraster's Keep\n. They have so far passed through seven villages without seeing anybody. Jon has\nheard many tales about \nCraster\n. \nThoren Smallwood\n swears he is a friend of the watch, though he has an unsavory\nreputation: \nDywen\n says he is a kinslayer, liar, raper, craven, and slaver. The Lord Commander tells Jon to spread the\nword down the column that he wants no trouble with Craster’s women, and the men will mind their hands and avoid\ntalking to the women.\nAs he rides down the line, he finally comes to \nSam\n with the baggage. The ravens are very unruly, and Sam explains\nthat they hate the rain like men. Sam states he is doing alright, but wet, and when he is told that Craster’s Keep is\njust ahead, he tells Jon that \nEddison Tollett\n says Craster marries his daughters, only follows his own laws, and that\nDywen told \nGrenn\n he has black blood. Also, that his mother is \na wilding\n that laid with a ranger. Sam almost goes on\nto call Craster a bastard, but Jon finishes for him, and says he has heard the word before. Jon finally makes it to the\nrear to give word to Ser \nOttyn Wythers\n, who considers it welcome news; he has always looked tired, but the rain has\nmade him look much worse.\nOn the way back up the column, Jon cuts through the woods. When he hears rustling, he thinks it is \nGhost\n, but it is\nDywen and Grenn. Jon gives them the news that Craster is alive, and discussion turns to how many wives he has.\nThen Ghost is loping beside Jon’s horse. Jon rides ahead to the keep.\nWhen he gets to the keep, he is very disappointed. He did not expect a stone castle, but what he finds, he would call\na midden heap. Inside the compound he sees a little naked girl pulling carrots, and two women tie a pig for\nslaughter. He can hear \nChett\n’s hounds' barking being answered by the bark of Craster’s dogs. Some of the dogs\nbreak off when they see Ghost, while others growl and Ghost ignores them. Jon estimates that only 30 or maybe 50\nwill get to sleep in the hall, but not their 200. Dolorous Edd has been entrusted with the commander’s mount and\ntells Jon that he is to join the commander in the hall, but the wolf should stay outside.\nInside the squalid, foul smelling hall, there are already two dozen rangers, including Jarman Buckwell and Thoren\nSmallwood. Jon thinks how he looked forward to seeing the wonders beyond\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4c7a271c66d671155728d789fa323226154765b94c7f03b1b32cde18789d0a00_v2"}
