Noye confirms that he forged Robert’s warhammer and claims he knew the \nBaratheon\n brothers as well as\nanyone. The smith compares Robert to a sword: made for fighting and prone to rust if left unused. When Jon asks if\nRobert’s brothers are the same, Noye considers for a moment then declares:\nRobert was the true steel. \nStannis\n is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets.\nHe’ll break before he bends. And \nRenly\n, that one, he’s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth\nall that much at the end of the day.\nJon wonders what metal Robb is, but decides it is best not to ask. Noye was a Baratheon man before taking the black\nand likely believes Robb is a traitor. There is an unspoken pact amongst the Watch not to probe too deeply into such\nmatters since old loyalties are not easily forgotten. Even Sam’s former \nHouse\n is sworn to \nHighgarden\n, which has\nsupported Renly. As Jon departs with Sam, Noye offers a prayer for Jon on the morrow and urges him to bring his\nuncle\n back.\nJon leaves Ghost outside the door of the King’s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont resides now that fire has\ngutted his own tower. Sam is disheartened by the number of stairs, but Jon jests that stairs are one thing they will not\nconfront beyond the Wall.\nWhen they enter the solar, Mormont complains about how long it took them. Ignoring the boys, \nThoren Smallwood\nargues that the Lord Commander’s place is at Castle Black. Mormont declares that Smallwood can do as he likes if\nhe ever becomes Lord Commander. Smallwood insists that the command should be his as First Ranger, but\nMormont will have none of it. He declares that he already sent out two rangings and will not wait and wonder if the\nthird is lost as well. Mormont dismisses Smallwood with the reminder that Benjen Stark remains First Ranger until\nhis death is confirmed. Once Smallwood is gone, Mormont exclaims that he would sooner name Sam as First\nRanger and complains that Smallwood called him too old for a ranging.\nBrusquely examining the maps, Mormont asks if they were all Sam could find. When Sam stutters, Jon points out\nthat the villages might be gone, but the geography will still be correct. Mormont asks Sam about the ravens and\n\ncommands that he wants the best, saying that if they are all butchered he means for his successor to know where and\nhow. Talk of butchery leaves Sam open-mouthed and speechless. Mormont declares he is too busy for such behavior\nand dismisses Sam, who almost trips in his haste to leave.\nMormont asks, without waiting for an answer, whether Sam is as big a fool as he seems. He explains that he was\nconsidering sending Sam as an envoy to King Renly, since his \nfather\n stands high in Renly’s councils, but Renly is\nnot likely to heed a quaking fat boy so Ser \nArnell\n (whose mother was a \ngreen-apple Fossoway\n) will go instead. Jon\nasks what Mormont would have of King Renly, and Mormont replies that he will take anything that is offered.\nMormont continues that Ser Alliser Thorne should reach King \nJoffrey\n soon, but \nHouse Lannister\n has never been a\nfriend to the Watch. Jon points out that Thorne does have the twitching \nwight\n’s hand to show them. Mormont\nlaments they do not have a second hand to send to Renly. Jon remarks that \nDywen\n claims a man can find anything\nbeyond the Wall. Mormont scoffs that Dywen also claims he saw a bear fifteen feet tall, insisting a man must\nbelieve his own eyes.\nTurning the conversation back to hands, Mormont asks Jon about his burned hand. Jon explains it is well enough to\nwield \nLongclaw\n and that he is exercising the fingers as Maester Aemon suggested. Mormont opines that Aemon\nknows his work and prays they can keep him another twenty years. Then he asks if Jon knows that Aemon could\nhave been king. Jon is taken by surprise; he assumed the maester was a younger son of a king.\nMormont explains that Aemon \nwas\n a younger son, the third son of King \nMaekar I Targaryen\n, who was himself the\nfourth son of King \nDaeron II Targaryen\n. Slow of sword but quick of wit, Aemon was sent to the Citadel when he\nwas nine or ten and ninth or tenth in the succession. Jon struggles to imagine the 100-year-old maester as a little boy.\nMormont continues that Crown Prince \nBaelor\n died in a \ntourney\n mishap and soon after his two sons, \nValarr\n and\nMatarys\n died in the \nGreat Spring Sickness\n along with King Daeron, so the crown passed to Daeron’s second son,\nAerys I Targaryen\n. Aerys reigned for twelve years (during which Aemon took his vows as a maester) then died\nwithout issue and the throne passed to Aemon’s father Maekar I. During his father’s reign, Aemon’s eldest brother,\nDaeron \"the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1a7fcd7aeb86bd096b87ae0227b2c4dc8078ca8a2d8e225b37ff25416dda707e_v2"}
