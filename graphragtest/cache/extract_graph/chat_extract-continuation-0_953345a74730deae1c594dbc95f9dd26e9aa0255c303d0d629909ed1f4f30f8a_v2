The simpering eunuch Varys immediately expresses sorrow over the \ntroubles\n on the road and\nassures Ned they are all praying for Prince \nJoffrey\n’s recovery. Ned coldly informs him that the prince grows\nstronger every day. When he sees Renly, Ned is struck by how much he looks like a young \nRobert\n. Littlefinger\nimmediately quips that Renly is much better dressed, having spent more on clothes than many ladies of the court.\nUpon introducing himself to Ned for the first time, Littlefinger mentions that \nCatelyn\n has most likely mentioned him\nbefore. Ned recalls that Littlefinger also knew his brother, \nBrandon\n, adding that Brandon mentioned him often and\nwith some heat. Littlefinger responds that he would have thought heat did not suit the Starks, who are rumured to be\nmade of ice and to melt south of the \nNeck\n. Ned replies that he does not plan on melting anytime soon.\nAfter a short greeting to Grand Maester Pycelle, Ned asks after the other members of the council and is told that\nStannis Baratheon\n left for \nDragonstone\n shortly after the king went north and that both Ser \nBarristan Selmy\n and King\nRobert are still riding through the city. When Ned suggests they wait, Renly explains that Robert finds the details of\ncoin and crops boring and rarely bothers to attend. Then Renly says that the king sent him ahead to convene the\ncouncil to handle an urgent matter and Littlefinger produces a sealed letter for Ned.\nThe king's letter contains an order that a \ntourney\n be held in honor of Ned's appointment as \nHand of the King\n. Ned is\nincredulous and not particularly happy with this extravagance being held in his name; the prizes alone total ninety\nthousand gold dragons and the costs are sure to run high as well. When Ned questions whether the treasury will bear\nthe expense, Littlefinger reveals that the Crown is already over six million gold pieces in debt, half of it to the\nLannisters\n. Ned is shocked; the \nTargaryens\n left a treasury overflowing with gold. He cannot believe that \nJon Arryn\nallowed Robert to beggar the realm, but the council explains that while Lord Arryn was a prudent man, Robert did\nnot always listen. Ned insists that this tournament is something the realm cannot afford and declares that they will\nconsider it later, then leaves abruptly.\nAs Ned proceeds toward the \nTower of the Hand\n, reflecting on the miseries of the last fortnight of the journey south,\nhe is intercepted by Littlefinger, who tells him he is going the wrong way. After a long journey through the \nRed\nKeep\n, Ned eventually realizes that Littlefinger is not leading him to the Tower. Littlefinger explains that he is\nleading Ned to his wife, but Ned does not believe him. Eventually, Littlefinger brings him to the foot of a bluff\n\noutside the castle, where they mount onto waiting horses and ride into the city.\nLittlefinger leads Ned to a brothel he owns and tells him his wife is waiting inside. Ned is furious at being taken all\nthis way to a brothel and holds a knife to Littlefinger's throat, claiming his brother was too kind. He is interrupted by\na man he eventually recognizes as Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, disarming his suspicions. Littlefinger leads Ned upstairs to\nmeet with Catelyn, explaining that a brothel is such a good hiding place because it is so unlikely.\nAfter embracing and exchanging news with Catelyn, Ned sees the scars on her hands and she places the \nValyrian\nsteel dagger\n used against \nBran\n in his hands. However, Ned cannot understand why \nTyrion Lannister\n would have\nattempted to murder Bran. Littlefinger states that the reason is obvious, and that Tyrion would have never acted\nalone. Ned tries to assure himself that Robert could never have been involved in this, but he remembers all the\nhorrid things the king has either supported or ignored. Queen \nCersei\n, on the other hand, Ned has no trouble believing\nto be responsible. Littlefinger reminds him that to accuse either is treason, but that if they can find proof of Cersei’s\ninvolvement, it is possible the king will listen.\nNed feels that he should take his case and the dagger directly to the king, but Littlefinger reminds him that there is\nno solid proof that Tyrion was involved. Then Catelyn explains that she has told Littlefinger about their suspicions\nconcerning Jon Arryn's death, and that Littlefinger has promised to help them learn the truth. When Ned asks how\nmuch Varys knows about all of this, he is told that Varys has not been told, but Catelyn warns that the man knows\nthings no normal man has any way of knowing.\nNed then asks Littlefinger to give him time alone with his wife. Littlefinger asks if they want time in a bed chamber\nbut Ned tells him that will not be necessary; he just needs a little time. Catelyn goes to Littlefinger and tells him that\nshe appreciates his efforts, and has found a brother that she thought she had lost. Ned is not so confident that\nLittlefinger can be trusted, but says nothing. After Littlefinger leaves, Ned\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>PERSON<|>Master of coin and a cunning member of the
