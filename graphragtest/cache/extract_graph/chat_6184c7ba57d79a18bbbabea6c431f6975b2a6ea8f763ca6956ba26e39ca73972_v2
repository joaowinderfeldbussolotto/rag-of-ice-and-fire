He becomes angry and grabs her. She hits him hard with a belt and tells him\nto leave.\nSynopsis\nThe \nkhalasar\n enters \nVaes Dothrak\n under the \nMother of Mountains\n and proceeds along the godsway, passing under\nthe gigantic Horse Gate, a pair of rearing bronze stallions whose hooves meet a hundred feet up. \nDaenerys\n wonders\nwhy Vaes Dothrak needs a gate when it appears to have no walls, no buildings, and no people. All that Daenerys can\nsee are ancient monuments that the \nDothraki\n have sacked over the centuries in the grass on either side of the\ngodsway.\nAs she looks back at her brother \nViserys\n, who is now mounted again, Daenerys thinks back on the events of the long\nride east. After the \nincident\n on the \nDothraki Sea\n, Viserys had been forced to walk and the Dothraki had named him\nKhal Rhae Mhar\n, the “Sore Foot King.” Viserys did not realize that he was being mocked when he accepted a ride in\na cart from \nKhal\n \nDrogo\n, which earned him another name, \nKhal Rhaggat\n, the “Cart King.” Daenerys had begged Ser\nJorah\n not to tell Viserys the truth, and only after much pleading had she convinced Drogo to allow Viserys to ride\nagain.\nNow, as they ride past the broke idols of fallen cities, Viserys tells Daenerys that all the Dothraki savages can do is\nsteal things better men have built and kill, which is all he needs them for. He goes on to say the Dothraki cannot\nspeak the language of civilized men, and then states that he is tired of waiting for Drogo to give him his army. Ser\nJorah tells Viserys that Drogo will honor his promise in his own time. Fortunately, few of the Dothraki can\nunderstand the Common Tongue. After Viserys leaves, Ser Jorah explains that the Dothraki are not merchants and\ndo not trade; despite what Viserys thinks, Khal Drogo considers Daenerys a gift and will eventually give a gift in\nreturn.\nDaenerys points out that it is not right to make her brother wait, and says Viserys believes he can sweep the \nSeven\nKingdoms\n with 10,000 Dothraki. Ser Jorah snorts that Viserys could not sweep a stable with 10,000 brooms.\nDaenerys asks whether it would be possible for someone stronger than Viserys. Ser Jorah tells her that when he first\ncame to \nEssos\n he saw the Dothraki as half-naked barbarians and believed that a thousand good knights could put a\nhundred times as many Dothraki to flight. Now he is not so sure; the Dothraki are better riders, their bows (wielded\nfrom horseback) have a longer range, and there are so many of them. Drogo alone commands 40,000 men, the same\nnumber that \nRhaegar\n brought to the \nBattle of the Trident\n, and only a tenth of Rhaegar's men were knights. When\nRhaegar died, many fled the field and such a rabble would not last long against 40,000 Dothraki. However, the\nDothraki have no patience for siegecraft and if the armies of \nWesteros\n stayed behind their castle walls they could\nhold out forever. \nRobert Baratheon\n might be fool enough to give them battle, but the men around him are not:\nStannis Baratheon\n, \nTywin Lannister\n, and \nEddard Stark\n. The way he says the last name leads Daenerys to ask if Ser\nJorah hates the man. Ser Jorah replies that Eddard Stark took everything he loved from him for a few lice-ridden\npoachers and his precious honor.\n\nThey arrive at the city, which is both the largest and the smallest Daenerys has ever seen; it sprawls ancient,\narrogant, and empty across the plain. The buildings are all different. Ser Jorah explains that they are built by slaves\nin the fashion they were familiar with. He also explains that the only permanent residents are the \ndosh khaleen\n, the\nwidows of all the \nkhals\n who have come before, yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house all the \nkhalasars\n if they\nshould all return at once, as is prophesized.\nWhen they near the eastern market and dismount, each rider gives up all his weapons to a waiting slave, for in Vaes\nDothrak no man may carry steel or spill blood. The palace of Khal Drogo is a massive feasting hall of roughhewn\nlogs that make a wall 40 feet tall with a roof of silk surrounded by horse yards and hundreds of earthen houses.\nDaenerys is met by \nCohollo\n, one of Khal Drogo’s \nbloodriders\n, who informs her that Drogo must ascend the Mother\nof Mountains that night to sacrifice for his safe return. As she speaks to Cohollo, Daenerys recalls that the \nkhal’s\nthree bloodriders are his sworn brothers who share everything with him except his horses. Daenerys is glad that\nDrogo does not hold to the tradition of sharing \nher\n with his bloodriders because some of them frighten her\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6184c7ba57d79a18bbbabea6c431f6975b2a6ea8f763ca6956ba26e39ca73972_v2"}
