Arya even tried\ncatching fish with her hands as \nKoss\n once did, but without success.\nBeneath Arya's tree, Hot Pie barks like a dog to signal her, an old poacher's trick Kurz taught them. With the\nnimbleness of a \nwater dancer\n, Arya returns to the ground to report her findings. Hot Pie opines that they should go to\nthe village and ask for food, convinced they will not be killed if they yield. Gendry accuses him of sounding like\nLommy, who has talked of little else since they escaped from the holdfast. Lommy and Hot Pie insist Lorch would\nhave left them alone if Yoren had yielded, but Gendry points out that knights and lordlings only take each other\ncaptive and do not care about the lower classes.\nHot Pie and Lommy start talking about searching for dead fish, cooking crows, and even hunting boars (which Arya\nknows they cannot do without boar spears, horses, and men) until Gendry proposes they steal food from the village\nafter he scouts it out. Arya argues that she should go instead because she is stealthier, but Gendry only agrees that\n\nshe can come with him. Hot Pie and Lommy worry about being left for the wolves, and Lommy whines that they\nshould yield to whomever they find because he needs some potion for his wounded leg. Gendry reminds them that\nLommy has a spear for the wolves and promises to bring back any leg potion they find, then dons his bull helm and\nwalks off.\nDuring their walk, Gendry stops and says he thinks Lommy is going to die. Arya is not surprised since she has felt\nLommy's warm skin and smelled the stink off his leg. She suggests finding a \nmaester\n, but Gendry dismisses it as\nunlikely. He suggests they should abandon Lommy, since Lommy would do the same and he is sick of Lommy's talk\nof yielding, adding that Arya is the only one who's good for anything, even if she is a girl. Arya panics and insists\nshe is not a girl, but Gendry insists he is not stupid and to prove him wrong she will have to pull out her cock.\nDesperate to escape the subject, Arya brings up the gold cloaks at the inn and says Gendry is also hiding something.\nGendry insists he does not know why they wanted him and turns the question back on Arya, asking why she thought\nthey were after her.\nRealizing her pretense is done, Arya decides she must kill Gendry or trust him and, after pleading that Lommy and\nHot Pie cannot know, she admits she is Arya of \nHouse Stark\n. Gendry is so shocked by the revelation that Arya is a\nhighborn lady that he becomes unsure how to act around her and begins calling her \"m'lady\" and begging her pardon\nfor talking about cocks and for pissing in front of her. Unsure if he is mocking her, Arya orders him to stop it, since\neven Hot Pie will notice if he starts calling her that. When Gendry responds by calling her \"m'lady\" again, Arya\nslams into his chest and he falls down, laughing. Then she gives him a kick in the side (which only makes him laugh\nharder) and sets off for the village, leaving Gendry to hurry after.\nAs they approach the village, they smell rotting flesh. Gendry decides to circle around to the west while Arya\ncontinues up the shore, slipping from bush to bush and stopping every few yards to listen. The smell gets worse as\nshe gets closer and she begins to hear horses and men. Squirming through a gap in a bramble thicket on the edge of\nthe village, Arya discovers a long gibbet full of corpses so decayed they hardly look like people. Arya forces herself\nto look at each one in turn, telling herself she is hard as a stone. Beyond the gibbet, two spearmen guard the doors of\nthe slate-roofed warehouse by the water. Arya cannot make out the two limp banners nearby, but she knows the dead\nmen must mean Lannisters.\nThe two guards turn toward a shout from a third man, who appears shoving along a prisoner Arya recognizes as\nGendry by his bull helm. One of the guards snatches Gendry's helm and, after beating him around a little, they shove\nhim through the heavy doors of the storehouse. From inside Arya hears sobbing and a loud shriek of pain. Then the\nwind flutters the banners and she makes out Lannister lion and three black dogs on a yellow field that she feels she\nshould remember.\nArya watches for hours as the armored men come and go, as dinner is prepared, and as night falls, but she does not\nsee an opportunity to free Gendry. Late at night she returns to the others to insist Hot Pie help her free Gendry. Hot\nPie insists they cannot fight twenty soldiers, but Arya argues they will only have to kill the two guards at the\nstorehouse. Lommy suggests they should yield or just leave Gendry, but Arya points out they need his to help carry\nLommy. When Arya insists she is going back to try, Hot Pie reluctantly agrees to come along.\nAs they are crawling along under the gibbet, a crow lands on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_29d5bd2d96b6afb74cb75b62a1ff2335629a973e228edb443a66c2f123add315_v2"}
