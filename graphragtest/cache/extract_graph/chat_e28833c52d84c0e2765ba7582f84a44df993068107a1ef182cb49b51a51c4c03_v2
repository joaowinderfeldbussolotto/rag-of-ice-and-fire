This is the first time that he is allowed to join. Bran's older brother\nRobb\n thinks the man to be executed must be a \nwildling\n sworn to \nMance Rayder\n, the \nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\n, which\nmakes Bran think of the tales Old \nNan\n has told him about wildlings.\nThe \noffender\n turns out to be an old man dressed in the ragged blacks of the \nNight's Watch\n who has lost his ears and\na finger to frostbite. Lord Eddard questions the man briefly. Then two guardsmen drag the man to the stump of a tree\nand \nTheon Greyjoy\n, Eddard's ward, brings Eddard his \nValyrian steel\n sword, \nIce\n. Eddard pronounces the sentence\n(desertion of the Night's Watch is punished by death) and raises the blade. \nJon Snow\n, Bran's \nbastard\n brother,\nreminds Bran not look away and so Bran watches as his father strikes off the man's head with a single stroke. The\nhead lands near Theon, who laughs and kicks it away. Jon calls Theon an ass under his breath and compliments Bran\non his poise during the execution.\nOn the way back to \nWinterfell\n, Robb and Jon argue about whether or not the deserter died bravely before racing\ntheir horses to the bridge, leaving Bran and his pony behind. Eddard rides up and asks if Bran knows why he\nexecuted the man himself. Bran replies that the man was a wildling. Eddard corrects that the man was a deserter,\nthen explains that the \nFirst Men\n – of whom the \nStarks\n descendant – believed that the man who passes the sentence\nshould perform the execution himself, lest he become too comfortable with ordering deaths; the Starks still hold to\nthat principle.\nJon calls from up ahead for them to come see what he and Robb have found. They find Robb holding something in\nhis arms next to the corpse of a wolf larger than Bran's pony. Jon correctly identifies the corpse as a \ndirewolf\n. Theon\ncomments that direwolves have not been seen south of \nthe Wall\n for two hundred years. Bran then notices that Robb\nis cradling a small pup, and gives it a stroke after Robb reassures him. Then Jon gives him another pup.\nWhen they inspect the mother's corpse, they find a large piece of shattered antler lodged in her throat. The soldiers\nin the company feel this to be a bad omen. Theon offers to kill the pups but Bran protests. Eddard initially states\nkilling them would be best but changes his mind when Jon points out that there are five pups, one for each of\nEddard's legitimate children; since the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, they must be meant to have the wolves.\nBran immediately realizes, along with everyone else, that the comparison only works because Jon is not claiming a\npup for himself.\nRobb and Bran both declare that they are willing to nurse their pups by hand themselves. Eddard stresses that the\nchildren must feed and raise the pups themselves, not pass them off to the servants, and must treat them well lest\nthey become dangerous. Both Robb and Bran state they will not allow the pups to die. As they begin to ride away,\nJon hears a noise and goes back to discover \na sixth pup\n, an albino with red eyes, that had crawled away from its\nmother. Bran finds it curious that it is the only pup that has opened its eyes. Theon claims that the albino will die\nquicker than the others, but Jon disagrees, claiming it for himself.\nNavigation:\n\nPrologue\n ←\nBran I\n→ \nCatelyn I\n↓\nBran II\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 2: Catelyn I\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran I\n ←\nCatelyn I\n→ \nDaenerys I\n↓\nCatelyn II\nLady \nCatelyn Tully\n seeks out her husband, Lord \nEddard Stark\n, in the \ngodswood\n of \nWinterfell\n to inform him of the\nnews that his foster father, Lord \nJon Arryn\n, the \nHand of the King\n, is dead and that King \nRobert I Baratheon\n, his\nfamily, and half his court are on their way to \nWinterfell\n.\nSynopsis\nCatelyn Stark\n seeks out her husband \nEddard\n in the \ngodswood\n following his return to \nWinterfell\n. She knows her\nhusband always goes there after executing a man. She finds the godswood very dark and unsettling compared to the\nsunny one she remembers from her childhood home in \nRiverrun\n. Unlike her own \nfamily\n, the Starks keep faith with\nthe \nold gods\n, rather than the \nFaith of the Seven\n.\nShe finds Ned polishing his ancestral greatsword, \nIce\n, under the \nheart tree\n at the center of the grove. He asks after\nthe children, and Catelyn tells him they are deciding on the names for their new wolves. Ned notes that the \nman\n he\nexcecuted is the fourth deserter this year.
