For the time\nbeing, the pits are packed full of livestock, from which the dragons are feeding regularly, and thus far, there has\nbeen no further evidence of either Viserion or Rhaegal eating people.\nThe council are convinced that the Yunkai'i are never going to accept any terms beside the killing of both dragons\nfor the return of the hostages. When asked what he will do when his terms are refused, Barristan replies \"Fire and\nBlood\". They quickly grasp his meaning; he intends to do battle with the Yunkish army. A lengthy discussion\nregarding the battle plan follows, particularly regarding the deployment of troops, targets to attack, how best to use\nthe \nUnsullied\n and other such concerns; however, all agree that if they can destroy the slavers, the \nsellsword\ncompanies will abandon their paymasters, and the dragons may make their presence known in the fight, though\nBarristan cannot say if they will help or just kill indiscriminately, though he does note that if they come, it will help\n\nbreak Yunkish morale.\nWhen the council adjourns, Barristan goes to the cell where the two Dornishmen are being held and informs them of\nPrince Quentyn's death. \nGerris Drinkwater\n angrily blames Daenerys for it, causing a fierce argument between him\nand Barristan, who bluntly dismisses Gerris's claims Quentyn came for love and asserts they came because\nQuentyn's father\n wanted the backing of \nHouse Targaryen\n before daring to defy the \nIron Throne\n, but \nArchibald\nYronwood\n angrily tells Gerris to shut up before more can be said. Barristan then makes an arrangement with the two\nDornishmen\n; in exchange for a ship back to Dorne and Quentyn's bones to return to his father, Barristan wants them\nto go back to the \nWindblown\n company and tell the \nTattered Prince\n that they will give him what he wants (namely\nPentos\n) if he can free and protect the hostages during the attack.\nThe Green Grace returns, telling Barristan that the Yunkai'i have refused his offer, and that the only price they will\naccept is the death of the dragons. As they speak, the Shavepate runs in and tells them that the six trebuchets have\nbegun flinging not rocks, but corpses into \nMeereen\n.\nNavigation:\nThe Kingbreaker\n↑\nJon XIII\n ←\nThe Queen's Hand\n→ \nDaenerys X\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 71: Daenerys X\nPlace(s): \nDragonstone\n in the \nDothraki sea\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys IX\n↑\nThe Queen's Hand\n ←\nDaenerys X\n→ \nEpilogue\nSynopsis\nDaenerys\n is walking back south through the \nDothraki Sea\n towards \nMeereen\n, following a small rivulet that she thinks\nwill flow into the \nSkahazadhan\n. She has spent her time flying \nDrogon\n, but could not make him take her back.\nInstead, they have been staying at his lair, a small cave in a hill she named \nDragonstone\n as a reference to \nthe place\nwhere she was born\n. She gets sick on the way, and has a number of hallucinations as she lies in the grass, bleeding\nand dying. These include a vision of \nQuaithe\n, of \nViserys Targaryen\n, and of \nJorah Mormont\n, and seem to revolve\naround the idea of forgetting who she is.\nFinally, a single \nDothraki\n scout approaches her, but does not see her. The scout freezes as Drogon approaches, and\nthen flees. Daenerys calls out for Drogon as he flies over, and mounts him. Drogon catches and devours a horse, and\nDany joins him.
