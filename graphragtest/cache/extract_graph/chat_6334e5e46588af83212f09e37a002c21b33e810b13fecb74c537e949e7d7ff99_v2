Starving them out would take far too long.\nThe next morning, Jaime is considering a parley with Ser Brynden, and recalls when he was a squire of \nSumner\nCrakehall\n, sent to Riverrun with a message. Lord \nHoster\n seated Jaime next to \nLysa\n, but the young man was far more\ninterested in Lysa's famous uncle, the Blackfish. Within sight of the walls of Riverrun, Jaime has his tent pitched,\nand soon receives a visit from his Aunt \nGenna\n and her husband, Emmon Frey.\nGenna is still a Lannister through-and-through, with the wit and sharp tongue also shared by all of Lord \nTywin\n's\nchildren. Jaime lies to them that their son \nCleos\n died bravely, and then listens to Emmon's complaints about a siege\ndamaging his castle. Jaime enlightens Emmon to the fact that he was named Lord of Riverrun, but \nPetyr Baelish\n is\nthe \nLord Paramount of the Trident\n. Emmon is outraged to learn he is a vassal of Petyr, but Jaime is unconcerned, as\nthere is nothing he can do about it and Cersei won't indulge someone like Emmon Frey. Genna tells Emmon to leave\nso she can speak in private with her nephew.\nLady Genna makes it known how she feels about Queen \nCersei\n rearming the Faith (namely that the decision is\nidiotic, given the trouble the \nFaith Militant\n caused the \nTargaryens\n before they were finally put down and disbanded),\nCersei's choice of councillors, in particular rejecting her brother Kevan as Hand, and Lancel's foolish decision to\nleave behind his lordship. When Jaime remarks that he plans to treat with Ser Brynden, his aunt tells him that he\nwould be better off beheading Edmure. But Jaime feels this may further the Blackfish's resolve, and would sooner\nassault the walls of Riverrun if a parley will not work.\nAt last, they discuss Lord Tywin, and Jaime asks her if she loved her eldest brother. Lady Genna tells him how it\n\nwas Tywin, a boy of only ten, who objected to their lord father's decision to wed the seven year old Genna to\nEmmon Frey, who was not even the heir to \nthe Twins\n. For that alone, she loved him, stating, \n\"...every little girl\nneeds a big brother to protect her. Who will protect us now?\"\nWhen Jaime insists that he is his father's son, his aunt replies, \n\"You smile like \nGerion\n and fight like \nTyg\n, and there's\nsome of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak... but \nTyrion\n is Tywin's son, not you.\"\nNavigation:\nJaime IV\n↑\nCersei VII\n ←\nJaime V\n→ \nCat of the Canals\n↓\nJaime VI\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 34: Cat of the Canals\nPlace(s): \nBraavos\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya II\n↑\nJaime V\n ←\nCat of the Canals\n→ \nSamwell IV\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nThe Blind Girl\nSynopsis\nAcclimated to the routine of Cat of the Canals, \nArya\n is learning the \nBraavosi tongue\n and trying to learn three new\nthings every time she is sent forth from the \nHouse of Black and White\n, as the \nkindly man\n told her she must. Selling\nclams by day, she sleeps in a bed with \nBrusco\n's daughters by night, and for three days during each black moon, she\nreturns to the House of Black and White. She delivers all three things the kindly man wants her to learn, but he still\nsends her back to Brusco. He tells her of the \nMany-Faced God\n; especially how all religions are aware of him, even if\nthey do not worship him. Even within \nthe Seven\n there exists \nthe Stranger\n, whom the kindly man calls \"Him of Many\nFaces\".\nOne night when the black moon begins, she meets \nDareon\n after he departs the Happy Port. Arya is angered by the\nsinger's abandonment of his vows as a \nblack brother\n. Returning to Brusco's, she gives him the coin she has collected\nselling his mollusks and a pair of new boots, then heads to the House of Black and White for three nights.\nThe \nwaif\n teaches her how to identify certain poisons like \nSweetsleep\n and the \nTears of Lys\n, and then tells her the full\nstory of how she came to the temple. She claims to be the eldest child from an ancient house, but when her\nstepmother had a true daughter, the woman tried to poison the waif. When her father discovered this, he delivered\ntwo-thirds of his wealth to the House of Black and White, and soon after, his second wife was dead and the waif\nnow a servant in the temple. She reveals that she lied about part of that tale, but before Arya can guess which part,\nthe kindly man visits her. She tells him the three new things she has learned, finishing with the knowledge that\nDareon is dead- his throat was slit and his body dumped in the canal. When the kindly man asks who killed him,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6334e5e46588af83212f09e37a002c21b33e810b13fecb74c537e949e7d7ff99_v2"}
