Eddard recognizes \nJaime Lannister\n, \nTyrion Lannister\n,\nCrown Prince \nJoffrey Baratheon\n, and \nSandor Clegane\n, but doesn't recognize his old friend King \nRobert\n until Robert\ncalls out. Eddard is shocked to see that Robert has gained 8 stone (112 lbs) since they last saw each other nine years\nago during the \nGreyjoy Rebellion\n. Eddard pays obeisance as Queen \nCersei\n and the younger children debark from the\nwheelhouse. After the formalities of greeting, including the introduction of children from both parties, Robert insists\non being taken down to the crypts where the dead of \nHouse Stark\n are buried, so he can pay his respects to Eddard's\nsister\n. Queen Cersei objects, but is disregarded by Robert, and quietly led away by her twin brother.\nNed asks Robert about his journey and Robert complains of the distance that has to be traveled in the vast emptiness\nof \nthe North\n. Robert then describes the advantages of living in the south, telling Ned he has to see the wonders, the\nwarmth, and the undress of the women.\nThey descend into the crypt, which is an effort for the out-of-shape Robert. Robert wants to visit the tomb of Ned's\nsister \nLyanna Stark\n, who was his betrothed. They pass the dead of House Stark with statues in front of the crypts,\neach lord holding a sword on his lap with a \ndirewolf\n at his feet. They arrive at the last of the occupied crypts. Here\nthere are three tombs for Ned’s father \nLord Rickard\n, his elder brother \nBrandon\n, and his sister Lyanna. Robert\ndeclares that Ned should have buried Lyanna on a sunny hillside, but Ned explains that she was a Stark of Winterfell\nand belongs here as was her wish. Ned remembers her dying, with only he and his friend \nHowland Reed\n nearby,\nwhile Robert recalls taking his vengeance on \nRhaegar Targaryen\n for what he did to Lyanna, regretting that he only\ngot to kill him once. Ned suggests that they should return to the surface where Robert's wife will be waiting. Robert\nreplies that the \nOthers\n can take his wife, but they start back all the same.\nAs they return, Ned asks about \nJon Arryn\n and Robert declares that he has never seen a man die so quickly: from\nhealthy to dead within a fortnight. Ned asks how Jon's widow \nLysa\n is bearing her grief, explaining that \nCatelyn\n fears\nfor her sister. Robert confides that he thinks Jon’s death has driven Lysa mad and that she has taken \nher son\n back to\nthe \nEyrie\n. Robert had hoped to foster the sickly boy with \nTywin Lannister\n, but Lysa refused to hear of it and left in\nthe dead of night; Cersei was furious. Ned, who does not trust Tywin, is relieved. Ned asks to foster Robert Arryn\nhimself, but Tywin has already agreed and Ned taking him as a ward would be an insult to Tywin.\nNed comments that Robert should visit \nthe Wall\n, but Robert responds that he has more important concerns such as\nreplacing Lord Arryn, who held several important positions such as \nWarden of the East\n. Ned reminds Robert that\nthat title traditionally goes with the domain of \nHouse Arryn\n but Robert declares that he will not appoint six-year-old\nRobert Arryn as \nWarden of the East\n. Ned reminds Robert that during times of peace the title is only an honor. The\nking is not pleased--the son is not the father, though maybe when the boy is grown the title will be given back.\nRobert mentions that he also needs a new \nHand of the King\n and offers the position to Ned so they can work together\nagain. Then Robert tells Ned how the responsibilities bore him and complains that he is surrounded by flatterers and\nfools. He insists that he wants Ned to come south to \nKing's Landing\n to be Hand of the King, the second most\nimportant man in the kingdom.\n\nNed does not want the position and tries to declare himself unworthy of the honor. Robert only jokes that he is not\ntrying to honor Ned but to get him to run the kingdom for him, relating the low-born saying that “the King eats and\nthe Hand takes the shit.” Robert asks for at least a smile, but Ned replies that it is said to be so cold in the North that\na man's laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death.\nKing Robert also offers to marry his son, the Crown Prince Joffrey, to Ned's eleven-year-old daughter \nSansa Stark\n to\njoin the Houses of Stark and Baratheon as he and Lyanna were supposed to. Ned hesitates\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_77e4377da1a61f4dce24e057bccef99c2a9e9191329ca5fb5b011477027813b5_v2"}
