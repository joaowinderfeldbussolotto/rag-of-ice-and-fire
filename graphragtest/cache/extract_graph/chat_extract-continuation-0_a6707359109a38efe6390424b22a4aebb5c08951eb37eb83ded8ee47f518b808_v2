The gold\ncloak with the broken nose laughs and tells her to put away the blade, calling her a girl. Arya insist she is not a girl,\nfurious that they do not understand she is the one they want. Yet when the Bull comes up behind her the officer\ndeclares him the one they want. It is a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, however, and quick as a snake Yoren\nplaces his sword at the officer’s throat.\n\nYoren declares that the gold cloaks will have neither of them, and reminds the officer that he has even more brothers\nin the inn. The officer drops his sword and Yoren declares that good steel is always needed on the Wall. The officer\ndeclares that Yoren had best hurry back to the Wall, and promises that if he catches Yoren again he will take his\nhead as well the boy's. Yoren declares that better men have tried and slaps the officer’s horse with his sword. The\nother gold cloaks follow.\nOnce the gold cloaks are out of sight, Hot Pie whoops in triumph, but Yoren remains angry and orders everyone up\nand moving; if they ride all night they may be able to stay ahead for awhile. After giving the officer’s sword to Hot\nPie, Yoren walks over to the Bull and declares that the queen wants him bad. Arya asks why the queen would want a\nbastard boy like the Bull, but the Bull asks why she would want a gutter rat like Arya. Suspicious that the Bull is\nmore than he appears, Arya asks his true name. He replies that it is Gendry. Yoren claims not to know why anyone\nwould want either of them, but declares they cannot have them regardless. He orders Gendry and Arya to take the\ntwo coursers and orders them to ride hard for the Wall at the first sight of a gold cloak, since the rest of them mean\nnothing to the gold cloaks. Arya points out that the officer promised to take Yoren’s head, but Yoren replies that if\nthe man can take it he is welcome to it.\nNavigation:\nArya I\n↑\nBran I\n ←\nArya II\n→ \nJon I\n↓\nArya III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 6: Jon I\nPlace(s): \nCastle Black\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon IX\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nJon I\n→ \nCatelyn I\n↓\nJon II\nJon Snow\n finds \nSamwell Tarly\n in the dark library cellar of \nCastle Black\n, where Sam has found a number of maps for\nthe great ranging\n. Out in the courtyard they watch the new recruits practicing and Jon talks with \nDonal Noye\n. After\nthey present their maps, \nLord Commander\n \nJeor Mormont\n discusses \nMaester Aemon\n’s past with Jon.\nSynopsis\nJon\n calls out to \nSamwell Tarly\n amidst the ancient books and scrolls of \nCastle Black\n’s library. Jon wends his way\ndown the narrow aisles toward the glow of Sam’s lamp to find the fat boy hunched over a table. When Jon asks if he\nhas been there all night, Sam reveals that he lost all track of time in the windowless cellar. Jon calls Sam a sweet\nfool and reminds him that soon they will be sleeping on hard ground, not soft beds. Sam yawns and explains that\nMaester Aemon\n sent him to find maps for \nLord Commander\n \nMormont\n, but he never thought there would be\nthousands of interesting documents to read. Jon is unimpressed by the books and asks if Sam found the maps.\nSam gestures toward a clutter of books and scrolls on the table and declares he has found at least a dozen. He shows\nJon a faded parchment that marks the sites of many \nwildling\n villages. Then he excitedly shows Jon an account of a\nranging to \nLorn Point\n by a ranger named \nRedwyn\n from before the \nTargaryen Conquest\n that mentions fighting with\ngiants\n and trading with the \nchildren of the forest\n. Meaning to sound encouraging, Jon suggests that Sam can write an\naccount of their own \ngreat ranging\n, but talk of what they are to face on the morrow makes Sam uncomfortable. He\nshuffles scrolls about and says there are more maps if he only had time to set the library in order, which will take\nyears. Jon remarks that the Lord Commander wanted the maps a little sooner than that.\nWhen Jon picks up a scroll it crumbles in his hand. Sam explains that the most important documents were copied\nover when needed, and the oldest have likely been copied half a hundred times. Jon says there is no need to copy\nthis one, which is only a list of goods. Sam seems fascinated, but Jon wonders who would care how much pickled\ncod men ate six hundred years ago. Sam insists that he would, since it can tell them how many men were in the\nNight’s Watch\n, and how they lived\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
