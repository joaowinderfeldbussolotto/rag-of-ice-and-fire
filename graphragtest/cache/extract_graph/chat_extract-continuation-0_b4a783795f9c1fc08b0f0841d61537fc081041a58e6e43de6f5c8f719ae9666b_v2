Because \nhis cell\n is open, his songs can be heard throughout the castle. Although\nMarillion has a beautiful voice, \nSansa\n does not like the sound of his singing. She asks \nPetyr\n if he cannot silence the\nsinger. Littlefinger explains to Sansa that they need Marillion. With some persuasion, Marillion has confessed to the\nmurder of \nLysa\n. In return for his confession, Littlefinger has spared his life and his voice. Petyr tells Sansa that she\nhas to corroborate Marillion's confession. Sansa knows that Marillion did not murder Lysa and therefore hesitates.\nShe has no pity for the singer as he has tried to rape her, but she is afraid that people will see through her lies.\nThe next day \nNestor Royce\n and \nhis son\n arrive at the Eyrie to investigate the murder of Lysa Arryn. Although she is\nafraid, Sansa tells the Royces that Marillion killed Lysa Arryn. Her fright and tears only make her more convincing.\nThen Marillion is led in. He confesses that he killed his mistress because he could not bear the thought of seeing her\nmarried to Petyr. The Royces never liked Marillion and don’t question his confession. They agree that Marillion will\nbe confined to the sky cells. Eventually he will fall or jump to his death.\nNestor then informs Petyr that \nhis cousin\n is gathering other lords to have Petyr removed as Lord Protector of the\nVale. Littlefinger already knows this and is unfazed. As a reward for his services, he presents Nestor with a grant\nthat makes him and his descendents hereditary Lords of the \nGates of the Moon\n. The Gates of the Moon are a\nsecondary castle that has always been in the possession of the \nmain Arryn line\n. Nestor has been appointed castellan\nbut now acquires the castle in his own right. According to Petyr, Lysa had already decided to give the castle to\nNestor but was murdered before she could sign the order. When Nestor Royce and his son leave, Littlefinger\nexplains to Sansa that the Royces will now be on his side. If Petyr is removed as Lord Protector, the grant for the\ncastle will be challenged because it was signed by Petyr and not by little \nRobert\n.\nThat night when Sansa goes to sleep, Robert creeps into her bed as he has been doing since his mother died. He asks\nSansa if she is his mother now. Sansa says yes because she knows this lie will soothe him.\nNavigation:\nSansa VII\nA Storm of Swords\n↑\nBrienne II\n ←\nSansa I\n→ \nThe Kraken's Daughter\n↓\nAlayne I\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 11: The Kraken's\nDaughter\nPlace(s): \nTen Towers\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa I\n ←\nThe Kraken's Daughter\n→ \nCersei III\n↓\nA Dance with Dragons\nThe Wayward Bride\nSynopsis\nAsha\n is at \nTen Towers\n waiting for her supporters to arrive.

In Asha's name, Rodrik has sent summons to the captains to gather at Ten Towers.\nThe captains of \nHarlaw\n isle have come but very few others. Rodrik informs Asha that \nAeron Greyjoy\n has called for\na \nkingsmoot\n, an assembly of all captains to choose the king. Rodrik assures Asha that her cause is hopeless, since no\nwoman has ever ruled the \nironborn\n. Even the support of Rodrik does not mean his vassals will support her. Their\nfealty is for war purposes only. In a kingsmoot they are allowed to vote as they please. Rodrik councils Asha to stay\naway from the kingsmoot. Besides her lack of support, he is afraid that \nEuron Greyjoy\n will kill his competitors.\nRodrik offers to give her Ten Towers instead.
