In addition, the Dothraki\ncaptives do not seem to fear slavery, while the villagers stumble about in fear and sorrow.\nSer \nJorah Mormont\n meets Daenerys at the entrance to the village. The knight brings news that Drogo has killed Khal\nOgo and \nhis son\n, taking only minor wounds. He also informs her that most of the rival \nkhalasar\n has fled, but there\ncould still be as many as 10,000 captives. Ser Jorah says he has suggested they drive the slaves south to \nMeereen\nwhere they will fetch a better price; more than enough gold to hire the ships they need to reach the \nSeven Kingdoms\n.\nAs she watches the carnage around her, Daenerys can only think about the price of the \nIron Throne\n.\nThe scenes of rape disturb Daenerys the most. She orders Ser Jorah and her \nbodyguards\n \nJhogo\n and \nQuaro\n to stop the\nrape of a \nwailing girl\n. Ser Jorah tries to explain that this is not wise since she is depriving the riders of their reward\nfor shedding blood for their \nkhal\n. Jhogo and Quaro point out that the Dothraki believe the girl should feel honored\nand even Daenerys’ handmaid \nIrri\n agrees. Daenerys is not dissuaded and commands Ser Jorah and the others to stop\nthe rape. Ser Jorah declares that she truly is \nRhaegar Targaryen\n’s sister and obeys.\nStopping the rape requires the death of two of the rapers. When asked what to do with the raped girl, Daenerys\ncommands \nDoreah\n to tend to her hurts, mainly because the blonde-haired \nLysene\n girl does not look Dothraki.\nDaenerys then rides on into the settlement and begins to rescue all of the other rape victims she sees. Ser Jorah tries\nto explain that she cannot save them all, but Daenerys refuses to believe him.\nDaenerys finds Drogo with an arrow through his arm and an \narakh\n cut that has taken off one of his nipples. Drogo\ninsists that they are only scratches and boasts that he personally slew not only Khal Ogo, but also his son \nFogo\n, who\nwas \nkhal\n after Ogo. Daenerys praises her husband.\nThen a warrior named \nMago\n, who rides with the \nkhas\n of \nKo\n \nJhaqo\n, rides up with angry words about Daenerys’\nactions. After listening to both sides, Drogo explains to Daenerys that rape is part of the Dothraki way of war.\nDaenerys insists that the Lhazareen women should be made wives and given a place in the \nkhalasar\n. A \nbloodrider\nnamed \nQotho\n asks haughtily if a horse breeds with sheep, but Daenerys replies that a dragon feeds on both horse and\n\nsheep. Drogo laughs at this and proclaims that his son inside her has made Daenerys fierce. The \nkhal\n goes on to tell\nMago to find another lamb to mount, as these belong to the \nkhaleesi\n.\nWhen Drogo reaches out to Daenerys, he winces and Daenerys cries for the healers. She is told that Drogo sent the\nhealers away to tend the more grievously wounded. \nMirri Maz Duur\n, a Lhazareen woman Daenerys rescued, speaks\nup, saying she can help. \nAggo\n is about to cut her throat when Daenerys demands that the woman, who wears the\nremains of fine clothing, be allowed to speak. Mirri Maz Duur explains that she is a healer and \ngodswife\n. Drogo’s\nbloodriders\n mistrust her, naming her a healer of sheep and a \nmaegi\n.\nDaenerys asks Mirri Maz Duur how she learned to become a healer, and the godswife states that she has learned\nfrom many including a \nmaester\n named \nMarwyn\n. Talk of a maester immediately interests Ser Jorah, and he asks for\ndetails. Ser Jorah then tells Daenerys that maesters know much of healing. Mirri Maz Duur explains that the \nGreat\nShepherd\n sent her to earth to heal all his lambs. Drogo finally speaks up and permits the godswife to heal him. Mirri\nMaz Duur suggests that the healing magic will be stronger inside her temple. Drogo rises to walk and falters, but he\nrefuses \nHaggo\n’s offer to help. Seeing that her husband is weak, Daenerys moves up to help him, telling him that\nsince she is not a man she can help him.\nMirri Maz Duur brings Drogo into the remains of her temple and says it is best if the rest leave, but Daenerys and\nthe bloodriders refuse. Daenerys assures everyone that Mirri Maz Duur will do no harm, feeling she can trust a\nwoman she saved from rape. The godswife says if they insist on remaining they can help hold Drogo down. She\npulls out the arrow, pours boiling wine on the wound, then sews the skin back in place. Next, she applies a plaster of\nleaves to the chest wound and instructs Drogo not to drink wine or \nmilk of the poppy\n or to remove the poultice for\nten days.
