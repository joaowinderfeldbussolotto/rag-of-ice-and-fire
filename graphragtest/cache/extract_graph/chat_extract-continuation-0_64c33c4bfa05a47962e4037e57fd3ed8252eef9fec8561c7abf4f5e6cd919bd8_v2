Mors immediately asks to\nwed Lady Hornwood; Luwin and Rodrik explain she is grieving but promise to consider it. Hother asks for\nlongships to stop \nwildling\n raids across the \nBay of Seals\n; Ser Rodrik recommends Hothor cooperate with Lord\nManderly to provide lumber and receive shipwrights and sailors.\nDuring the audience, the steward of \nDeepwood Motte\n arrives with apologies from Lady \nSybelle Glover\n, who is\ntending to her young children. Bran quickly realizes the steward is the true ruler while Lord \nGalbart Glover\n and his\nbrother \nRobett Glover\n are away fighting. After discussing the harvest, Ser Rodrik questions the steward about\nLarence Snow, and afterward Maester Luwin praises Bran's notion of making the bastard heir to Hornwood and says\nhe will make a good lord for Winterfell one day. Bran protests that Robb's sons with his \nFrey\n girl will be lords\ninstead of him, but Ser Rodrik points out that nothing is certain; he has only his daughter \nBeth\n despite three\nmarriages, and his brother \nMartyn Cassel\n's line died with his son \nJory\n despite having four sons.\nThe next day, \nLeobald Tallhart\n from \nTorrhen's Square\n, who arrived the day before, has his audience. He brings word\nthat his nephew \nBenfred Tallhart\n is raising his own company of young lancers who all think themselves another\nyoung wolf; Leobald dismissed them as young rabbits once, so now they call themselves the \nWild Hares\n. Bran\nremembers Benfred visiting Winterfell and being friendly with Robb and \nTheon Greyjoy\n. Clearly displeased, Ser\nRodrik orders that Benfred is to remain at Torrhen's Square as commanded. Then Leobald mentions that his own\nwife \nBerena\n was sister to Lord Halys Hornwood and suggests sending his younger son \nBeren\n to foster with Lady\nHornwood, saying he may even take up the Hornwood name if made heir. Bran has learned the proper answer and\npromises to bring up the matter with Robb and Lady Hornwood. After the audience, Maester Luwin states that he\nlikes the idea, but Ser Rodrik thinks it will be hard for a boy to hold the lands. Luwin admits that with \nthe Riverlands\n\nnow part of the kingdom, it may be best to wed her to one of the lords of the \nTrident\n.\nIn the days that follow, ravens arrive with regrets from the other Houses. The bastard Ramsay Snow will not be\njoining them, the \nMormonts\n and \nKarstarks\n have all gone south, Lord \nOndrew Locke\n is too old, Lady \nLyessa Flint\n is\ntoo pregnant, and there is sickness at \nWidow's Watch\n. That leaves just Lord \nHowland Reed\n, who has not left his\nswamps in sixteen years, and the \nHouse Cerwyn\n, whose Lord \nMedger Cerwyn\n is a captive of the Lannisters.\nThen, one blustery day, fourteen-year-old \nCley Cerwyn\n arrives with a dozen lancers while Bran is riding \nDancer\n in\nthe yard. Cley has always been a friend to Bran and his brothers and he immediately asks if \nStannis Baratheon\n wrote\nWinterfell about \nJoffrey Baratheon\n being illborn. Bran suddenly feels like a giant hand is crushing his chest. When\nCley asks if he is alright, Bran declares that Robb will beat Stannis, too. That night he does not have the dreamless\nsleep he prayed for. The three-eyed crow pecks out his eyes, telling him to fly. Then the crow pecks his brow until it\npecks through his skull and then, suddenly, Bran can see again. He is climbing to a tower, slipping. He calls for help\nand a \ngolden man\n appears above him, saying, \"The things I do for love,\" and then tossing him out into empty air.\nNavigation:\nBran I\n↑\nTyrion III\n ←\nBran II\n→ \nTyrion IV\n↓\nBran III\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 17: Tyrion IV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n - \nRed Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion III\n↑\nBran II\n ←\nTyrion IV\n→ \nSansa II\n↓\nTyrion V\nTyrion\n meets with \nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n, \nLittlefinger\n, and \nVarys\n in turn, and gives each a secret plan.
