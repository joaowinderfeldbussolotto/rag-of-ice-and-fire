He insists Pycelle send his swiftest birds immediately; breakfast will\nkeep, but the realm may not with Lord \nRenly Baratheon\n leading his host up the \nroseroad\n, and no one knowing when\nLord \nStannis Baratheon\n will sail from \nDragonstone\n. Pycelle moves ponderously to obey, and Tyrion notes that his\nmaester\n's chain is far more ornate than the standard.\nTyrion has plenty of time to finish part of his breakfast before he sees the ravens take off. He then inspects Pycelle's\nwell-organized potions and steals a small bottle from the high shelf. He is back eating when the maester returns to\ninquire about the message, but Tyrion insists it is best kept a secret. When Pycelle suggests bringing the matter to\nthe \nsmall council\n, Tyrion replies that the council exists to advise King \nJoffrey\n, who is only thirteen. When ascked\nabout the queen, Tyrion replies that \nCersei\n carries a great weight already and Pycelle reluctantly agrees it is best not\nto add to her burden, given the frailty of her sex. Tyrion wonders what \nEddard Stark\n would think of that description,\nbut says nothing and asks to be informed secretly when a reply comes from \nDorne\n. As he departs, Tyrion thinks to\nhimself, \nOne\n.\nIn the lower bailey, Tyrion finds \nBronn\n (who is now armored as befits his role as captain of the \nHand\n's guard)\nwatching the men-at-arms practice. He jokingly notes that Bronn is paying no attention to a pair of pretty serving\ngirls. Bronn replies that he can buy all the sex he wants, but one day his vigilance could save his life. He points out\nthat the \nhedge knight\n named Ser \nTallad\n is the best, but he falls into a rhythm that will be his death when he faces\nBronn.\nAs they cross the bailey, Bronn informs Tyrion that thirty supplicants await him, including Lady \nTanda Stokeworth\n's\npage with an invitation to supper. Lady Tanda thinks Tyrion would be the prefect consort for her soft, dimwitted\ndaughter \nLollys\n and is plying him with food; Tyrion tells Bronn to send his regrets. There is also a moneylender\nfrom \nBraavos\n wanting repayment of a loan; Tyrion orders him directed to \nLittlefinger\n, who will find a way to put\nhim off. Another supplicant is a minor lordling from the \nTrident\n who wants recompense for the destruction done to\nhis land. Seeing the value of a compliant \nriver lord\n, Tyrion promises to make time for him tomorrow and orders him\ngiven good quarters, a meal, and new boots courtesy of King Joffrey. There are also many food merchants who want\nprotection from the hungry mobs who recently roasted a baker in his own oven for overcharging. Tyrion suggests\ngold cloaks\n, but Bronn notes there were gold cloaks in the mob, and the merchants demand to see the king. Tyrion\ncalls them fools since Joffrey would send them off with whips and spears. Bronn also reports that Ser \nAlliser Thorne\nof the \nNight's Watch\n has arrived with a rotten hand. Tyrion recalls his distaste for the man, and orders him given a\ndirty cell and left waiting.\nAfter Bronn departs to carry out his orders, Tyrion encounters Cersei and her retinue by the main gate. When he\n\nasks where she is going, Cersei claims she is going to inspect the defenses in light of Renly marching from\nHighgarden\n. She believes he could arrive by the full moon, but Tyrion assures her that Renly is traveling too slowly\nand stopping to feast and hold court at a different castle each night. Tyrion is dubious that Renly actually has the\nrumored 100,000 men, but Cersei snaps that he has all the power of \nStorm's End\n and Highgarden; only \nHouse\nRedwyne\n has held back, and that is thanks to her taking the twins \nHoras\n and \nHobber\n captive. Tyrion retorts that it is\na shame she let Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n slip away, and points out Renly has \nRobb Stark\n at \nRiverrun\n and \nTywin Lannister\n at\nHarrenhal\n to concern him. He adds that he would do the same as Renly: progress slowly, flaunt his power, watch,\nand wait. If Robb defeats Tywin, the south will fall into Renly's hands like a windfall, and if Tywin defeats Robb,\nRenly can attack the weakened Lannister host. Cersei demands Tyrion make their father bring his army to King's\nLanding, but Tyrion points out he has never been able to make Lord Tywin do anything. Ignoring this answer, she\nasks what he is doing to free \nJaime\n, who is worth a hundred of Tyrion. Tyrion quips that they do not have a hundred\nof him to trade to \nCatelyn Stark\n. Angered, Cersei declares him worse than useless and leaves.\nIn truth, Tyrion fears Stannis twice as\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_380e2cceda6d3105c5abd18fdc8c44243319d80186f127ef28b19febe3bca1e7_v2"}
