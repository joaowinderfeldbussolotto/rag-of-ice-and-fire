Its reading has proven extremely tedious, just as Pycelle warned, and scarcely a\nman now alive had been born when it was written, but Ned is sure \nJon Arryn\n had a reason for reading it. As he\nbrowses the section on \nHouse Lannister\n, Ned muses on their long history and the myths of their ancestor \nLann the\nClever\n, who stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair.\nJory arrives and briefs Ned on his interview with one of Jon Arryn’s stableboys, the last of the four leads provided\nby Littlefinger. Ser \nHugh\n proved brusque, arrogant, and uninformative. The serving girl could only say that Jon\nArryn had been reading too much, concerned about his \nson\n’s frailty, and gruff with his \nwife\n. Meanwhile, the pot boy\nwas only able to provide lots of kitchen gossip, including that Lord Stannis had accompanied Lord Arryn to meet an\narmorer\n about elaborate new armor. The stableboy proves just as informative. He swears that Lord Arryn was as\nstrong as a man half his age and often went riding with Lord Stannis. This Ned finds strange; as far as he knew, Jon\nand Stannis were never friendly. Jory says that the stableboy also claims that Stannis and Jon Arryn visited a brothel\ntogether. Unfortunately, the boy did not know which brothel; only the guards that escorted them would know, and\nthey were taken back to the \nEyrie\n with Lady \nLysa\n.\nThat Stannis would visit a brothel is very strange because he is so stern and humorless. That Stannis’ name keeps\ncoming up and that he has left the city with no word about when he will return also vexes Ned. He wonders why\n\nStannis would leave and decides that something must have frightened him, yet Ned cannot imagine what could have\nfrightened Stannis, who withstood the year-long \nSiege of Storm's End\n by surviving on rats and boot leather. Both\nNed and Jory find it frustrating that that everyone that might know the truth is a thousand leagues away. When Jory\nasks if he will call Stannis back from \nDragonstone\n, Ned says not yet.\nNed plans to visit the armorer himself and decides to wear his doublet with the direwolf sigil so the armorer will\nknow who he is. As Jory dresses him, Ned wonders why Renly was not invited on the rides. Ned does not know\nwhat to make of Renly with his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days back, Renly showed him a locket with a\npicture of \nMargaery Tyrell\n. He asked Ned if she resembled \nLyanna\n and seemed disappointed when Ned shrugged.\nNed finds it queer that Renly, who looks so much like \nRobert\n, would be obsessed with a lady that he thought looked\nlike Lyanna.\nNed tells Jory that it would be good if Stannis returned for the tourney, but Jory’s response makes Ned more certain\nthat Stannis will not. He also wonders why Lord Arryn would be interested in showy armor when he had always\nconsidered armor something for protection, not ornament. Ned then tells Jory that he better start visiting brothels,\nwhich Jory jokingly calls a “hard duty.”\nThe streets of \nKing’s Landing\n are crowded, but Ned and his guardsmen \nVarly\n and \nJacks\n make it through the crowd\nto the \nMud Gate\n where Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n is arriving with his retinue to participate in the Tourney of the Hand.\nAt the \ntop\n of the \nStreet of Steel\n they find the huge house of the armorer \nTobho Mott\n. After shouldering his way in, a\nserving girl notices Ned’s sigil and badge of office and Tobho Mott quickly appears, offering wine. Mott\nimmediately tells Ned that his prices are not cheap but his craftsmanship in unequaled in the \nSeven Kingdoms\n. He\nadds proudly that \nthe Knight of Flowers\n buys all his armor from him and that he can work \nValyrian steel\n.\nNed lets the armorer go on for a while before he asks if Jon Arryn bought a falcon helm from him. Mott says that\nLord Arryn bought nothing, only wanting to see the apprentice boy named \nGendry\n. Any hint of friendliness leaves\nMott when Ned asks to see the boy as well. In the hot stone barn that contains the forges, the armorer introduces\nGendry and shows Ned a helmet that the boy has crafted. Ned notes that the unfinished helm is expertly shaped and\noffers to buy it. Gendry immediately grabs the helmet back, insisting it is not for sale. Mott rushes to offer apologies\nfor Gendry’s behavior, but Ned states there is nothing to forgive.\nNed asks Gendry what he and Jon Arryn talked about. Gendry explains that Lord Arryn asked about his age, if he\nwas well treated, and about his mother. Ned asks about the boy’s mother as well, and is told that she is dead, but that\nshe was an alehouse wench with blonde hair. Ned examines Gendry and notices a remarkable resemblance to a\nyounger King Robert, especially his black hair and blue eyes.\nNed asks Mott who paid the boy’s apprentice fee. Mott claims he took the boy on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE LANNISTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>One of the Great Houses with a long history and myths about their ancestor Lann the Clever)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>PERSON<|>Former Hand of the King who was reading a book and had a mysterious death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>PERSON<|>A person who provided leads about Jon Arryn's activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER HUGH<|>PERSON<|>A brusque and arrogant person interviewed by Jory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LORD STANNIS<|>PERSON<|>A stern and humorless lord who accompanied Jon Arryn to meet an armorer and visited a brothel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY LYSA<|>PERSON<|>Wife of Jon Arryn who was gruff with him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EYRIE<|>GEO<|>A location where Lady Lysa and guards were taken back to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRAGONSTONE<|>GEO<|>A location where Stannis has gone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENLY<|>PERSON<|>A person who looks like Robert and is obsessed with a lady resembling Lyanna)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGAERY TYRELL<|>PERSON<|>A lady whose picture Renly showed to Ned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYANNA<|>PERSON<|>A person whom Renly thought Margaery Tyrell resembled)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT<|>PERSON<|>A person whom Renly looks like)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING’S LANDING<|>GEO<|>A city with crowded streets where Ned and his guardsmen travel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VARLY<|>PERSON<|>One of Ned's guardsmen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACKS<|>PERSON<|>One of Ned's guardsmen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUD GATE<|>GEO<|>A gate in King’s Landing where Beric Dondarrion arrives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERIC DONDARRION<|>PERSON<|>A lord arriving at the Mud Gate to participate in the Tourney of the Hand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREET OF STEEL<|>GEO<|>A street in King’s Landing where the armorer Tobho Mott's house is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOBHO MOTT<|>PERSON<|>An armorer with a house on the Street of Steel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN KINGDOMS<|>GEO<|>A region where Tobho Mott's craftsmanship is unmatched)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE KNIGHT OF FLOWERS<|>PERSON<|>A person who buys armor from Tobho Mott)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDRY<|>PERSON<|>An apprentice boy who Jon Arryn wanted to see)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOURNEY OF THE HAND<|>EVENT<|>A tournament where Beric Dondarrion participates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>HOUSE LANNISTER<|>Jon Arryn was reading about House Lannister<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>LITTLEFINGER<|>Littlefinger provided leads about Jon Arryn's activities<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>LORD STANNIS<|>Jon Arryn and Stannis went riding together and visited an armorer and a brothel<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD STANNIS<|>EYRIE<|>Stannis and Jon Arryn were escorted back to the Eyrie<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD STANNIS<|>DRAGONSTONE<|>Stannis has left for Dragonstone<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENLY<|>ROBERT<|>Renly looks like Robert<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENLY<|>MARGAERY TYRELL<|>Renly is obsessed with Margaery Tyrell<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RENLY<|>LYANNA<|>Renly thought Margaery Tyrell resembled Lyanna<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>KING’S LANDING<|>Ned travels through King’s Landing<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>VARLY<|>Varly is one of Ned's guardsmen<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>JACKS<|>Jacks is one of Ned's guardsmen<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERIC DONDARRION<|>MUD GATE<|>Beric Dondarrion arrives at the Mud Gate<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERIC DONDARRION<|>TOURNEY OF THE HAND<|>Beric Dondarrion participates in the Tourney of the Hand<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOBHO MOTT<|>STREET OF STEEL<|>Tobho Mott's house is located on the Street of Steel<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOBHO MOTT<|>THE KNIGHT OF FLOWERS<|>The Knight of Flowers buys armor from Tobho Mott<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JON ARRYN<|>GENDRY<|>Jon Arryn wanted to see Gendry<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NED<|>GENDRY<|>Ned asks to see Gendry and notices his resemblance to Robert<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
