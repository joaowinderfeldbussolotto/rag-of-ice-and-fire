The others depart for \nRiverrun\n, or so \nTom\n tells \nArya\n.\nHarwin\n tells Arya the tale of how they first rode out in search of \nGregor Clegane\n, and about all the men they lost\nwhen Gregor's men fell on them. Most of the 120 men from the original group are dead, including \nLothar Mallery\nand \nGladden Wylde\n. It was all a trap; Lord \nTywin\n had planned for \nEddard\n himself to ride out and deal with Gregor,\nbut \nJaime\n didn't know of the plan when he attacked Ned in the streets of \nKing's Landing\n. As Eddard's leg was\nbroken, he had to send others out. \nDondarrion\n and his men learned a sharp lesson when the trap sprung. Dondarrion\nshould have died, having been run through with a lance, but \nThoros of Myr\n saved him. After Tywin became \nHand of\nthe King\n they became outlaws themselves but they kept fighting in the name of \nKing Robert\n. They harried the\nforaging parties and attacked the baggage trains of Tywin's army, and their brotherhood began to grow as many\nflocked to their cause, mostly commoners uprooted by the war.\nLater, they meet up with \nGreenbeard\n and learn that Jaime Lannister has escaped from Riverrun. When Arya\ndiscovers that they mean to bring her before Lord Beric rather than take her to Riverrun, she tries to ride off, but\nHarwin catches her. Her father's man is now a member of the \nBrotherhood Without Banners\n, and answers only to\nBeric and Thoros' Lord of Light, the god \nR'hllor\n.\nNavigation:\nArya II\n↑\nSansa II\n ←\nArya III\n→ \nSamwell I\n↓\nArya IV\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 18: Samwell I\nPlace(s): \nbetween the \nFist of the First Men\n and \nCraster's Keep\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya III\n ←\nSamwell I\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nSamwell II\nSynopsis\nSam\n and the few survivors from \nthe Fist\n are running south in the middle of night with a heavy snow falling. They\nare ringed by men with torches to keep the \nwights\n away, but Sam is beginning to lag and is near exhaustion. He\neventually falls in the snow, and cannot get back on his feet. He recalls the horror that occurred at the Fist, when the\nwights fell on the \nNight's Watch\n. \nMormont\n had commanded him to send ravens with warning, and Sam kept sending\nthem with updates, but when it came time to send a raven with word that their end was near, Sam had already let the\nbirds escape. The Watch held the Fist at first, using fire arrows to hold back the wights. But the dead were relentless\nand eventually overpowered the Watch, men dying by the score. Mormont had the survivors mount up and form a\nwedge, slashing past the wights and down off the Fist into the forest. Now they are running for \nthe Wall\n, pursued by\nthe wights and perhaps the \nOthers\n.\nGrenn\n tries to get Sam to his feet, but the fat steward is too tired. Finally \nSmall Paul\n arrives and carries Sam, but the\nthree of them have fallen far behind the survivors with their torches, and the cold sets in. Upon an undead horse, an\nOther appears from the swirling snow. The being kills Small Paul with its ice sword, but Sam stabs the Other with\nthe \ndragonglass\n dagger that Jon gave him. The dagger causes the Other to melt away, body and armor, before Sam\nand Grenn's eyes. Grenn retrieves the icy cold \nobsidian\n dagger, and they once again run off to try and catch up with\nthe other survivors.\nNavigation:\nArya III\n ←\nSamwell I\n→ \nTyrion III\n↓\nSamwell II\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 19: Tyrion III\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion II\n↑\nSamwell I\n ←\nTyrion III\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nTyrion IV\nSynopsis\nThe \nsmall council\n meets to discuss the progress of the war, and \nTyrion\n learns that \nLancel\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3c6d70db9c9c68064c11391328f081562c015dddf2759a3b4eb974758842cf8d_v2"}
