Robb rides at the head with \nCatelyn\n, \nEdmure\n beside him and Ser \nRaynald\nbearing his banner. Catelyn cautions Robb again about offending Lord \nFrey\n, and advises him to ask for food and\nwine as soon as they arrive to secure the \nguest rights\n. They are met by a contingent headed by Ser \nRyman Frey\n, Lord\nFrey's grandson, and three of Ryman's sons: \nEdwyn\n, \nBlack Walder\n, and \nPetyr\n. When they come near, \nGrey Wind\nbegins to growl and leaps forward, causing Petyr's horse to throw him. Ser Ryman is angered that Queen \nJeyne\n is\nnot among them and Catelyn offers her apologies, but Black Walder says that Lord Walder will be displeased. The\nFreys tell them they have rooms prepared for Robb, Catelyn, and Edmure, and their bannermen at the \nWater Tower\nbut the army is to cross the bridge to the far end and join Lord Frey’s and Lord \nBolton\n’s men beneath pavilions\nerected for the wedding.\nWhen they reach the gatehouse, Grey Wind refuses to continue and howls. \nLame Lothar\n comes up, saying he must\nfear the water and offering to give him over to the master of hounds but Robb has Ser Raynald stay with him\ninstead. Robb enters the great hall, where Lord Walder and his eighth wife \nJoyeuse\n await. Lord Walder is relentless\nin his veiled insults against Robb, making it clear that the King betrayed him by breaking his solemn oath. Robb\napologizes, and then \nRoslin\n is brought out. She is by far the most beautiful of Walder’s get. After Edmure meets his\nsoon-to-be-bride, Catelyn asks the Lord of the Crossing for some food and he says \"bread and salt . . . of course\" and\nthe old man welcomes them as guests to his table.\nWhen Lord Bolton joins them, Robb finds out more of what happened at \nWinterfell\n, and his bannerman tells him\nthat \nRamsay\n rescued many of the women and has been fighting the ironmen. Lord Bolton again states that his\nbastard son’s blood is tainted, but maybe his deeds will atone for the crimes he committed. He tells them that\nRamsay is holding \nTheon\n hostage, and he shows them a piece of Greyjoy’s skin, his son having been flaying the\ncaptive Greyjoy. Bolton explains that as \nBalon Greyjoy\n's sole surviving son, Theon's uncles (\nVictarion\n, \nEuron\n, and\nAeron\n) will want him dead as his claim to the \nSeastone Chair\n is greater than theirs, and that they can demand\nconcessions from the ironborn as the price of Theon's execution; Robb reluctantly agrees for Theon to remain\nimprisoned at the \nDreadfort\n. Bolton lost men crossing the \nTrident\n when \nGregor Clegane\n’s army attacked (see \nBattle\nof the Ruby Ford\n). Bolton has brought mostly his own and \nKarstark\n men, leaving all the others to guard the Trident.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn V\n↑\nJon VI\n ←\nCatelyn VI\n→ \nArya X\n↓\nCatelyn VII\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 50: Arya X\nPlace(s): \nthe Twins\n \n \nNavigation:\nArya IX\n↑\nCatelyn VI\n ←\nArya X\n→ \nCatelyn VII\n↓\nArya XI\nSynopsis\nSandor\n and \nArya\n arrive at \nthe Twins\n where Sandor hopes to ransom Arya to \nher family\n.
