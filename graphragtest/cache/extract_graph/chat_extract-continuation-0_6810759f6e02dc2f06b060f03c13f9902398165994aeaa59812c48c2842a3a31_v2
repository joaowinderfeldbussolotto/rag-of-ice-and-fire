The beautiful \nLady Nym\n is far more tactful than her older half-sister, but no less\nresolved to seek vengeance for her father. Scoffing at Obara's demand to go to war, Lady Nym tells her uncle that\nshe needs only her sister \nTyene\n, and the two will assassinate Cersei, \nJaime\n, Lord Tywin and King \nTommen\n. Stating\nthat his brother was only to take the measure of \nJoffrey\n's court and not seek revenge for \nElia\n despite the seventeen\nyears that have passed, Nymeria responds in parting, \"My sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our\nvengeance.\"\nArriving in \nSunspear\n, the prince's retinue is accosted by townspeople calling for vengeance for the Red Viper. In the\nOld Palace\n, Princess \nArianne\n greets her father and tells him that Tyene Sand awaits him in the throne room. The\nthird of the Sand Snakes is embroidering when the captain encounters her while bearing Prince Doran to his high\nseat. Tyene offers her uncle the cloth she is knitting, which shows her father mounted on a sand steed, so that he will\nnot forget the Red Viper. Prince Doran responds, \"I am not like to forget your father.\" Tyene counsels her uncle to\nwed his son \nTrystane\n to \nMyrcella\n now, and then crown the princess as is the \nDornish\n way. This would incite the\nQueen Regent and \nHighgarden\n to march on Dorne, where the prince's armies could bleed them in the high passes\nand treacherous deserts. When she calls her uncle fearful, Doran advises her, \"There is a difference between fear and\ncaution.\" Tyene raises her hand to touch her uncle, but Hotah brings the butt of his longaxe down on the marble\nfloor, and cautions her, \"My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you.\" The Sand Snake replies that she\nmeant no harm and loves her uncle, he loved his brother. After she takes her leave, Maester \nCaleotte\n rushes to the\nPrince's side to make sure he was not pricked by one of Tyene's needles.\nShortly after, Prince Doran commands the captain to round up and confine all the Sand Snakes, including \nEllaria's\nyoung daughters. Obara, Nymeria and Tyene are locked up in cells at the top of the Spear Tower, but with no blood\nspilled, the younger Sand Snakes are restricted together with their mother to the Water Gardens. When Hotah tells\nhim that the common folk will howl when they find out, the \nPrince of Dorne\n replies, \"All Dorne will howl. I only\npray Lord \nTywin\n hears them...so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear.\"\nNavigation:\nThe Prophet\n ←\nThe Captain of Guards\n→ \nCersei I\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 3: Cersei I\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nChapter 2\n ←\nCersei I\n→ \nBrienne I\n↓\nCersei II\nCersei\n has a nightmare that features \nTyrion\n mocking her. She is woken to be informed of Lord \nTywin\n's murder. She\ngives order to make sure that Tyrion is safely in his cell and reflects on who could be behind the murder, settling for\nStannis\n and the \nTyrells\n as suspects. In a rush of desire for her brother, Cersei asks \nJaime\n to take the position of\nHand\n, but is rejected and settles for Ser \nKevan\n. Information arrives that Tyrion has escaped.\nSynopsis\nCersei\n dreams that she rules from the \nIron Throne\n and courtiers are paying her tribute. But the pleasant dream turns\ninto a nightmare when \nTyrion\n appears and ridicules her, making the great lords, proud ladies and young knights\nsnigger at her as well. She notices she is naked and tries to cover up. Hasty moves make her wound herself on the\nspikes and blades of the Iron Throne and soon she is engulfed in a mortal combat with the throne that is trying to rip\nthe flesh off her.\nShe is woken up by her frightened maid \nSenelle\n, accompanied by armed men who have arrived to deliver the news\nof Lord \nTywin's\n murder. Cersei is still drowsy and believes this to be part of her nightmare. For a moment, she\nmistakes the \nKingsguard\n knight who has been sent by the \nLord Commander\n for \nJaime\n himself and expects Tyrion to\ncrawl from under her bed to laugh at her, although she knows that he is safely in his \nblack cell\n and his execution will\ntake place the same day. She drank too much wine last night, she thinks. She now recognizes \nJocelyn Swyft\n, Ser\nOsmund Kettleblack\n and Ser \nBoros Blount\n and notices \nLannister\n guards, while she is being handed lemon water to\nwaken her up.
