In addition to the list of weapons suggested by the tribesmen, Tyrion offers them the \nVale\nof Arryn\n.\nNavigation:\nTyrion V\n↑\nJon V\n ←\nTyrion VI\n→ \nEddard XI\n↓\nTyrion VII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 43: Eddard XI\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nEddard X\n↑\nTyrion VI\n ←\nEddard XI\n→ \nSansa III\n↓\nEddard XII\nAs \nHand of the King\n, \nNed\n hears a petition from some \nHouse Tully\n bannermen concerning raiding on their holdfasts\nby \nGregor Clegane\n. He strips Clegane of all lands, titles, and his life and sends a force under Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\nto dispense the king's justice.\nSynopsis\nEddard Stark\n is in the throne room where \nRobert I Baratheon\n's hunting tapestries have replaced the \nskulls of the\nTargaryen dragons\n. He is extremely uncomfortable after hours on the \nIron Throne\n; the throne's spikes and jagged\nmetal make it impossible to lean back and his shattered leg is throbbing more sharply each minute. \nAegon the\nConqueror\n, who commanded his armorers to create the throne out of the swords laid down by his enemies, had said\na king should never sit easy. At this point, Ned is damning both Robert and Aegon. His only conciliation is that at\nleast he can sit, as can the three councilors in attendance: \nVarys\n, \nPetyr Baelish\n, and Grand Maester \nPycelle\n. The rest\n—including the petitioners, lords, and guards—must stand.\nThe kingdom has been a tinderbox since \nCatelyn Stark\n seized \nTyrion Lannister\n, and Ned has the task of figuring out\nhow best to stanch the hemorrhaging. Ser \nKaryl Vance\n explains that the smallfolk kneeling before him are all that\nremains of the holdfast of \nSherrer\n, while those of \nWendish Town\n and the \nMummer's Ford\n are all dead. The villagers\ntell of the brutality, murder, rape, and destruction. The \nraiders\n were interested not in stealing but in destruction,\nmaking them \nLannister\n invaders. Ser \nRaymun Darry\n continues by explaining that the people of Wendish Town took\nrefuge in their wooden holdfast but the perpetrators burned the holdfast and shot anyone that tried to run out. The\nSherrer holdfast was made of stone, so this tactic did not work.\nNed asks for proof that the raiders were from House Lannister and is told that there were 50 or 100 men, all mounted\non war horses and armored in mail with good weapons. Their armor was plain and they flew no banners but the\nleader was as big as an ox: \nGregor Clegane\n, the Mountain That Rides. Pycelle points out that there are many large\nmen in the kingdom, but the petitioning knights insist there is none as large as the Mountain. Pycelle asks why the\nMountain, who holds lands and is an anointed knight, would turn brigand. Ser \nMarq Piper\n calls the Mountain a false\nknight and Lord \nTywin Lannister\n's mad dog. Pycelle asks Ned to remind the knight that Lord Tywin is the father of\ntheir gracious queen, \nCersei Lannister\n. Ned sarcastically declares that the court might have forgotten if Pycelle had\nnot reminded them. It is then that Ned looks up to see men going out the door and also spots Septa \nMordane\n with\nSansa Stark\n; he has a flash of anger since this is no place for a girl, but calms himself that the septa had no way of\nknowing this was no ordinary day.\nLittlefinger asks where the knights responsible for protecting these holdfasts were when this destruction was going\non. The petitioning knights reply that they had answered the call of their liege lord to marshal at \nRiverrun\n and below\nthe \nGolden Tooth\n in anticipation of a Lannister invasion. They also declare that now Ser \nEdmure Tully\n has dispersed\nmen to guard all the border holdfasts along the \nRed Fork\n. Ned thinks to himself that this may be exactly what Lord\nTywin wants: to bleed off the strength of Riverrun as Edmure scatters his swords to defend every holdfast.\nLittlefinger asks what the knights are looking for from the throne if they have already protected their lands. They\nreply that, as they still keep the king's peace, they seek permission to retaliate. Ned is thankful that they have asked;\nTywin Lannister obviously hoped to provoke a Tully invasion so that he might claim to be the aggrieved party.\n\nPycelle insists that it is Lord Tywin's responsibility to dispense justice to his bannerman, Ser Gregor, but Ned\nreminds everyone that all justice flows from the king.\nPycelle immediately suggests that, in that case, they should wait for Robert to return, but Ned asserts his right as\nHand\n to speak for the king.
