He spies Ser \nRobar Royce\n, whose father is hunting with Robert, and tells him to ride to\nthe king and advise him of the situation. Ned refuses the petitioning knights permission for vengeance and tells the\nvillagers he cannot give them back what they have lost, but can give them justice. He continues by telling the\nvillagers that the \nFirst Men\n believed that the man who passes judgment should wield the sword, but his injury means\nhe must send another to do his killing. Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n asks for the honor of slaying Ser Gregor, but Ned denies\nhim, reiterating that the goal is justice, not vengeance. Ned looks at the assembled lords and orders Lord \nBeric\nDondarrion\n, \nThoros of Myr\n, Ser \nGladden Wylde\n, and Lord \nLothar Mallery\n to each assemble twenty men. Ned also\nsends twenty \nHouse Stark guards\n of \nWinterfell\n. Lord Beric is given command, as befits his rank. Then Ned\nannounces in the name of Robert that these men are charged with bringing to justice the false knight Gregor\nClegane, and that Gregor is stripped of all lands and titles and sentenced to death. Then he tells them to ride at first\nlight so it can be done quickly, and that the throne will hear no more petitions.\nAt the base of the throne, \nVarys\n is still gathering papers when everyone else has left. He declares Ned a bolder man\nthan himself. He goes on to suggest that Ned should have sent Ser Loras, as a man who is an enemy of the\nLannisters would do well to make the \nTyrells\n his friends. Varys also reminds Ned that it was a slight not to send Ser\nIlyn Payne\n since he is the \nKing's Justice\n. Ned does not like the man, but tells Varys that he would prefer not to send\na Lannister man to kill a Lannister bannerman. Varys informs Ned that he saw Ilyn in the back and he did not look\npleased, likely because he so loves his work.\nNavigation:\nEddard X\n↑\nTyrion VI\n ←\nEddard XI\n→ \nSansa III\n↓\nEddard XII\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 44: Sansa III\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nSansa II\n↑\nEddard XI\n ←\nSansa III\n→ \nEddard XII\n↓\nSansa IV\nSansa\n wonders with \nJeyne Poole\n why \nher father\n did not send the gallant Ser \nLoras\n to kill the monster Ser \nGregor\n.\nThe next day her father reveals that he is sending her and \nArya\n back to \nWinterfell\n. Sansa insists that she cannot\nleave because she is to marry Prince \nJoffrey\n, who is nothing like \nhis father\n and will give her children with golden\nhair. This is an epiphany to her father.\nSynopsis\nSansa is bewildered that \nher father\n did not send the \nKnight of Flowers\n after Ser \nGregor Clegane\n. She tells her friend\nJeyne Poole\n that she thinks it is because her father was in a foul mood from his leg wound. Sansa believes sending\nSer Loras, who looks like a hero, to slay the monstrous Ser Gregor would have been just like the tales. Sansa tells\nJeyne that she said as much to Septa \nMordane\n, but that the septa only told her not to question her father’s decisions.\nLittlefinger\n, who had overheard, claimed that her father’s decisions could do with a bit of questioning. When Sansa\nhad explained to him about monsters and heroes, Littlefinger told her life was not a song.\nJeyne suggests that Lord Eddard should have sent Ser \nIlyn Payne\n, but Sansa replies that he is like a second monster.\nThen Jeyne begins to speak dreamily about Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n, telling Sansa how brave and gallant he is. Sansa\ncan only think that even though Lord Beric is handsome, he is also old: almost 22.\nChanging the subject, Sansa tells Jeyne that she has had a dream about Prince \nJoffrey\n taking the white hart the\nking’s party is hunting in the \nKingswood\n; it was actually only a wish, but Sansa thinks it sounds better to call it a\ndream. In her heart, Sansa thinks that her prince is far worthier than his drunken father. Jeyne asks if Joffrey just\ntouched the hart in the dream, since that is what heroes always do in the stories, but Sansa insists that Joffrey shot it\nwith a golden arrow and brought it back for her because she knows Joffrey likes hunting and killing.\nSansa does not think Joffrey had anything to do with killing her father’s men; that was all his uncle \nJaime\nLannister\n’s doing. She knows her father is still angry about it, but believes that blaming J\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LORD TYWIN<|>PERSON<|>Lord
