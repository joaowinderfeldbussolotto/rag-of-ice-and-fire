When asked, Bran tells the maester that Jojen only claims to have\ndreams that sometimes come true. The maester tells Bran that everyone has dreams that come true, like when he and\nRickon dreamed their \nfather\n was in the crypts before they knew he was dead. He then asks Bran whether he\nremembers the meaning of the metals of a maester’s chain: black iron for ravenry, silver—healing, gold—sums.\nLuwin pulls his chain around his neck to reveal a link made of \nValyrian steel\n and tells Bran that it signifies the study\nof the higher mysteries, magic; this is a study of small use that few maesters trouble with. He goes on to say that\nmagic may have once been a mighty force but no longer: \nValyria\n was its last ember, and dragons, the children, and\ngiants are no more. Jojen does not have the greensight since no living man has that power.\nBran tells Meera what the maester said when she comes to him at dusk, and that Summer should not have tried to\nhurt Jojen, but Jojen should not have made the comments about his dreams; the crow lied, and so did Jojen that Bran\ncould fly. Meera suggests that the maester may be wrong, but Bran replies that he is not and that his father depended\non him. She leaves him with another of Jojen’s dreams, that one day soon Maester Luwin will serve him a king’s cut\noff the roast at a great feast, but the portion he gives to the Walders will be grey and dead, yet they will like their\nmeal better than he.\nThat night Bran is almost afraid to sit at supper, but everyone is served the same, and there is nothing wrong with\nthe food served the Walders. Bran is relieved: nothing bad is coming to Winterfell, but he is disappointed also—so\nlong as there is magic anything can happen. He will never walk, fly or be a knight.\nNavigation:\nBran III\n↑\nDaenerys II\n ←\nBran IV\n→ \nTyrion VII\n↓\nBran V\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 29: Tyrion VII\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VI\n↑\nBran IV\n ←\nTyrion VII\n→ \nArya VII\n↓\nTyrion VIII\nIt is late at night when \nTyrion\n is disturbed by the arrival of \nLancel\n with demands from \nCersei\n that \nPycelle\n be\nreleased and Ser \nJacelyn Bywater\n be arrested for defying a command in the \nking's\n name. Lancel is arrogant until\nTyrion reveals he knows his part in King \nRobert's\n death and that Lancel has been having sex with the queen. Tyrion\nthreatens to tell Joffrey, and this convinces Lancel to agree to be Tyrion's spy. Afterwards, Tyrion travels a\ncircuitous route to be with \nShae\n.\nSynopsis\nTyrion\n is informed by a sleepy \nPodrick Payne\n that \nLancel Lannister\n has arrived. Tyrion is not bothered by the late\nhour since he usually works well into the morning reading \nVarys\n' whisperers' reports or going over \nLittlefinger's\naccounts. He figures, however, that \nCersei\n was expecting Lancel's late arrival would catch him less alert. Tyrion\ntakes his time, and roughens his hair to make it look like he has been woken from his sleep.\nTyrion warmly greets Lancel, who has been pacing. Lancel tells him that Cersei commands that \nPycelle\n be released,\nhanding Tyrion her warrant. Tyrion tells Lancel he hopes she is not overtaxing herself, he would not want to see a\nrelapse. After being assured that she is recovered, Tyrion states it is music to his ears, thinking he should have given\nher a larger dose. Tryion offers Lancel mulled wine to help him sleep, and he rejects the offer, having not come to\ndrink. Tyrion states that wine has its dangers and that he would have thought if Cersei was so concerned about\nPycelle she would have come herself. Lancel tells Tyrion just to release the prisoner with a sneer, that the queen is\nJoffrey's\n regent. Tyrion replies that he is Joffrey's \nHand\n. Lancel replies “The Hand serves. The regent rules until the\nking is of age,” and Tyrion says maybe he should write it down so he can remember, and tells Podrick to leave.\nAfter Pod leaves, Lancel states that Ser \nJacelyn Bywater\n defied a command in the king's name, and that Cersei\ndemands he be removed and charged with treason; Tyrion thinks that it means that Cersei has already ordered\nPycelle's release and Bywater rebuffed her. When Lancel threatens Tyrion, Tyrion responds that he will hear no\nwarning from a boy. Lancel touches his sword and warns Tysrion to watch his words. Tyrion in turn warns him that\nat a cry from him, \nShagga\n will break in and kill Lancel with an axe and not a wineskin. Lancel, incensed, tells\nTyrion that he is a knight. Tyrion asks if Cersei had him knighted before or after she took him to bed.
