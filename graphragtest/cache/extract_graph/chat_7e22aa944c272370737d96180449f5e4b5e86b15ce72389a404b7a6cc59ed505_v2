He likes the girl Bronn has found.\nTyrion invites Shae into his tent. When he asks if she is a maiden, Shae tells him that finding out will cost him\ndouble and Tyrion decides they will get along fine. Tyrion explains that her duties besides sleeping with him include\nserving him and monogamy. When they have sex, Shae expresses pleasure, which pleases Tyrion, who decides he\ndoes not care if it is feigned. Tyrion also finds it good to be with a woman after nearly a year of enforced abstinence.\n\nAfterward, he sneaks out of the tent without waking Shae. Outside, he asks Bronn where he found her and is told\nthat she was stolen from a knight because all the pretty ones were taken. Tyrion comments that he did not ask Bronn\nto make him an enemy, but agrees to keep Shae. When Tyrion asks for the name of the knight so he can avoid him\nin battle, Bronn insists that Tyrion will have him for protection. Tyrion then tells Bronn that if they both survive the\nbattle, he can name his reward. Bronn asks who would want to kill Tyrion and Tyrion explains who has put them in\nthe vanguard. Bronn only laughs and jests that a small man with a big shield will give the enemy archers fits.\nTyrion returns to the tent to find Shae. When Tyrion asks whom Bronn has taken her from, she tells him that the\nknight was a minor figure and a small man. Tyrion mockingly asks if she takes him for a giant, but Shae insists she\ndoes, calling him ‘’my giant of Lannister.’’\nTyrion wakes before dawn to battle horns and Shae’s cries. Outside, Bronn informs him that the \nStark\n host has come\ndown the kingsroad at night and they are forming up for battle a mile north. Tyrion’s well-fitting suit of armor is at\nCasterly Rock\n, so Podrick Payne and Shae help him into the ill-fitting oddments that have replaced it. Tyrion asks\nShae to weep for him if he dies, but she only asks how he will know. He is helped onto his heavily-armored horse\nand given his battle-axe. Shae tells him he looks fearsome, but Tyrion disagrees. He instructs his squire Podrick to\ntake her safely home if they lose. As the sun rises and he rides north, the clansmen fall in behind him.\nOn the \nbattlefield\n, Lord Tywin commands the reserve in his magnificent armor that puts Jaime’s to shame. Ser\nKevan commands the center and Ser Addam Marbrand the right, where Lord Tywin has massed his armored\nknights. The northmen will be tired after their long sleepless march; Tyrion wonders what Robb Stark was thinking.\nTyrion spies the massive Ser Gregor Clegane with the vanguard massing on the left. Bronn, looking at Ser Gregor,\nstates that it is best to follow a big man into battle since he attracts all the archers, which Tyrion finds amusing. They\nhear Ser Gregor tell his men that if anyone runs he will cut them down himself. Tyrion receives his orders to hold\nthe left of the left next to the river. When Tyrion’s clansmen reach the \nGreen Fork\n, Tyrion commands them to keep\nthemselves between the enemy and the river. Then the clansmen raise their battle cry of “Halfman!”\nAlthough the van is all mounted, it is comprised of misfits and sweepings, including half-trained boys. Tyrion notes\nthat the force is unfit to hold the left, and wonders what his father was thinking. When the enemy appears, their\nnumbers seem great, but Tyrion knows that his father has more. He also notes that the Freys are among the enemy.\nThe northerners charge and are answered first by the Lannister bowmen. Ser Gregor orders the charge, and the\nclansmen quickly leave Tyrion in their dust. The charge nearly breaks against the \nKarstark\n spearmen opposing them,\nbut Ser Gregor’s horse crashes through the shield wall as it dies. The monstrous knight rises from his fallen mount\nand begins slaying men all around. Before the gap in the enemy line can close, Shagga rides through right behind\nSer Gregor, followed by the other clansmen.\nThe northmen’s line begins to crumble under the assault. Then Tyrion and Bronn are in the fight and Tyrion\nsuccessfully defeats a number of enemies, including a close fight with a tall northerner whom Tyrion only\novercomes because his horse bites the man’s cheek, giving Tyrion the opening to kill him. Then a knight with a\nmorning star comes at Tyrion, wounding and unhorsing him. The knight calls for Tyrion to yield, but Tyion uses the\nspike on his helmet to eviscerate the horse, which falls on the knight, disabling and trapping him. The knight yields\nto Tyrion. Tyrion can now see that the battle has moved past him. The northerners are being pushed against the hills\nand pelted by arrows. Finally, Bronn rides up and Tyrion sees his father ride by with the reserves to break the\nnortherners. Tyrion finds the remnants of his clansmen, of whom perhaps half, including \nConn\n and \nUlf son of Umar\n,\nare dead.\nTyrion searches for his father and finds him sipping wine as his armor is removed.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7e22aa944c272370737d96180449f5e4b5e86b15ce72389a404b7a6cc59ed505_v2"}
