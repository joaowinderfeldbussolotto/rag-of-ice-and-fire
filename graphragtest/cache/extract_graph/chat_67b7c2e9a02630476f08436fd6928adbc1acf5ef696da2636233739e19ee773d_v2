Once\nthat is done, \nObara Sand\n is to lead Balon to Darkstar's lair at \nHigh Hermitage\n and destroy him. Doran also reveals to\nthe Sand Snakes that sources loyal to him in King's Landing have told him the truth he was not meant to hear of this\nvisit to the capital; Queen Regent \nCersei Lannister\n plots to have Trystane killed on the way. An ambush is planned\nsomewhere in the \nkingswood\n, where their party will be attacked by outlaws and Trystane will be slain. Blame for the\nattack will be placed on the Imp, \nTyrion Lannister\n, as the outlaws will be crying \"Halfman!\" during their attack and\nBalon will claim to catch a glimpse of the Imp. The Sand Snakes are disbelieving, but Doran points out that knights\nof the \nKingsguard\n are sworn to obey, regardless of their personal feelings on their orders, and points out that Balon\nargued against traveling by sea to return to King's Landing, as this would disturb the planned arrangements. Doran\nstill does not want to defy the \nIron Throne\n openly, so \nNymeria Sand\n is to accompany Myrcella back to King's\nLanding and take the seat on the council, while \nTyene Sand\n is also to travel to King's Landing, ordered to try and get\nclose to the \nnew High Septon\n and thus give the Martells an ear amongst \nthe Faith\n.\nThis article or section is a \nstub\n.

They are also nervous about the fact Jon is keeping two corpses in the ice\ncells, and react with outrage and horror when Jon reveals he is waiting for them to rise, ignoring Jon's argument that\nthe Watch knows next to nothing about the wights or their masters, and need to learn more if they are to defeat them.\nOverlooking their protests, Jon tells them of a large group of \nwildlings\n making for \nHardhome\n at the east coast north\nof the Wall, following the witch \nMother Mole\n who claims they will find ships there to bring them across the \nNarrow\nSea\n. Jon fears they will die there, but when he gets only indifference from the others at the prospect of thousands of\ndead wildlings, Jon finally loses patience. Angrily asking if they don't realise the truth or are just ignoring it, Jon\npoints out that if they do nothing, the wildlings at Hardhome will die in their thousands, and when they are dead, in\ntime they will rise up again with blue eyes and cold hands, and the \nOthers\n will have thousands more \nwights\n under\ntheir control to send at the Wall.\nNavigation:\nJon VII\n↑\nThe Watcher\n ←\nJon VIII\n→ \nTyrion IX\n↓\nJon IX\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 40: Tyrion IX\nPlace(s): \nthe \nSummer Sea\n, on board of the \nSelaesori Qhoran\n \n \nNavigation:\nTyrion VIII\n↑\nJon VIII\n ←\nTyrion IX\n→ \nThe Turncloak\n↓\nTyrion X\nSynopsis\nStill on board the \nSelaesori Qhoran\n, \nTyrion\n jousts on \nPenny\n's 'Pretty Pig', for the amusement of the crew in hopes of\nsweetening their mood, while the ship has been floating becalmed in the \nGulf of Grief\n.

During the storm, the main mast breaks, crippling the ship. Moqorro and others are swept overboard,\nthe captain and the cook die, and Tyrion is wounded from a splinter.
