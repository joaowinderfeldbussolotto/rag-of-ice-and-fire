Before leaving, she wrote to \nBran\n and \nRickon\n and visited her father but he mistook her for \nher mother\n.\nHalf a day's ride from Renly's camp they are spotted from a windmill and intercepted by Ser \nColen of Greenpools\nwith twenty men. When Catelyn announces herself as the envoy of the \nKing in the North\n, Ser Colen insists that\nRenly is king of all the \nSeven Kingdoms\n and escorts her to his camp at \nBitterbridge\n, where the \nroseroad\n crosses the\nMander\n. With nearly all the chivalry of the south behind him, Renly's camp is immense. Thousands of cookfires\ncloud the air and a vast menagerie of banners fly from a veritable forest of staffs. Monstrous siege engines line the\nroad, tents and pavilions dot the landscape, and the whole place bustles with people. Everywhere Catelyn sees the\ngolden rose of \nHouse Tyrell\n and across the river Renly and his \nstorm lords\n have raised their own standards. Catelyn\nrecognizes many of the sigils, but for each one she knows there are a dozen she does not, all assembled to make\nRenly a king.\nPassing through a line of pavilions, they come upon \na tourney melee\n taking place beneath the battlements of a small\ncastle. Less than a score of contestants remain ahorse, cheered on by hundreds of spectators. Since penetrating the\ncrowd proves difficult, Ser Colen asks that Catelyn's escort wait while he presents her to the king. A roar goes up\nwhen a knight of \nHouse Tarth\n in cobalt armor unhorses \nRed Ronnet Connington\n, but the carnage makes Catelyn\nthink it mad for Renly to be playing at war with real enemies all around.\nAmong the lords and ladies in the gallery, Catelyn recognizes stout Lord \nMathis Rowan\n, delicate Lady \nArwyn\nOakheart\n, and martial Lord \nRandyll Tarly\n, but others she knows only by sigil or not at all. The handsome King\nRenly sits in their midst, looking like a youthful ghost of his brother \nRobert\n and laughing with his young queen\nMargaery Tyrell\n, a girl of Robb's age with a shy smile and curly brown hair. Catelyn knows their marriage is the\n\nmortar of the great southron alliance, and the rose sigil and green-and-gold colors of House Tyrell are prominent in\nRenly's slender crown and velvet tunic.\nOut on the field, only four men remain and both king and commons obviously favor young Ser \nLoras Tyrell\n in his\nsilver mail and rainbow cloak. Two others ally against the blue-clad knight from Tarth but are quickly unhorsed.\nForced to discard his now-broken shield for the final duel, the blue knight is at a disadvantage and soon disarmed by\nSer Loras. Yet as Loras prepares the final blow, the blue knight charges into it, grapples him to the ground, and\nopens Tyrell's visor with a dirk to make him to yield.\nAs the blue knight salutes the king in victory, squires rush to help Loras Tyrell remove his helm and Catelyn is\nstartled by his youth and beauty. Renly then bids the champion to approach and there are a few cries of \"Tarth!\" and,\noddly, \"A Beauty!\" but most remain silent. Renly declares the blue knight to be all his father claimed since Loras is\nrarely unhorsed, but Catelyn overhears accusations of trickery from the crowd. When she asks why the man in blue\nis so disliked, Ser Colen explains that the champion is no man but \nBrienne of Tarth\n, the daughter of Lord \nSelwyn the\nEvenstar\n, who is often called \"Brienne the Beauty,\" though never to her face.\nKing Renly officially declares Brienne the champion as the last mounted of 116 knights and offers her any reward\nwithin his power. Brienne asks to be made one of his seven \nRainbow Guard\n and Renly agrees. It is only when\nBrienne removes her greathelm that Catelyn understands Ser Colen's words: the only thing beautiful about Brienne\nare her girlish blue eyes. Her face is broad, coarse, and freckled, with a large mouth full of crooked teeth and a nose\nthat has been broken more than once. Catelyn is filled with pity for the girl, yet Brienne looks anything but\nunfortunate when Renly fastens the rainbow cloak to her shoulders, and her face lights up with a smile as she\nproudly pledges to give her life for him.\nSer Colen interjects to introduce Catelyn, though she needs to insist that Robb is King in the North as well as Lord\nof Winterfell. Renly looks surprised, but greets her warmly and introduces his queen, who offers condolences for her\nhusband's death. Renly even swears to bring her \nCersei Lannister\n's head when he takes \nKing's Landing\n, but Catelyn\nreplies that justice will be enough. Brienne of Tarth notes that Catelyn should kneel and refer to the king as \"Your\nGrace,\" but Catelyn insists they have more pressing matters to discuss. Some of Renly's lords bristle, but the king\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_64f3b76b0b591ead70495895f8a67fd0764654ff4e8ba98495bfa3954138b2b3_v2"}
