Theon dresses richly before leaving to meet his father. Balon\nis smaller, gaunter, and greyer than Theon remembers him. Balon asks what Theon is now, and Theon replies he is a\n\nman and Balon's heir. Balon only says they will see. Balon criticizes Theon's clothing and asks if the gold chain\naround his neck was bought with iron or gold. Theon, recalling that the \nOld Way\n stipulates a warrior may only wear\njewelry taken from enemies he has slain, has to admit the chain was bought with \ngold\n. Balon yanks the chain off\nTheon's neck, declaring that \nhis daughter\n has taken an axe for a lover and that he will not have his son dress like a\nwhore. Balon accuses Theon of having grown weak due to the green lands and decides the Starks have made Theon\ntheirs, calling Theon \nRobb Stark\n's envoy. Theon claims the letter of Robb he carries was based on Theon's own\ncounsel, which amuses Balon. However, when Theon tells Balon that Robb looks upon him \"as an older brother\",\nBalon grows angry.\nTheon hands his father the letter, but it fails to impress Balon. In the letter, Robb offers Balon a crown in return for\nhaving the ironborn attacking the \nwesterlands\n, specifically \nLannisport\n and \nCasterly Rock\n. Theon tells Balon the\nproposed plan is his own and asks for his reward Casterly Rock as his own seat. Balon scoffs at the notion of\nreceiving such handsome reward for \"a notion and a few lines of scribbling\" and shows his dislike for the notion that\nRobb will give him a crown, as \"what is given can be taken away\". Balon burns the letter and backhands Theon\nwhen he protests. Balon declares that he will pay the iron price for his crown and take it by conquest as \nUrron\nRedhand\n did five thousand years before. However, Balon feels Casterly Rock to be too strongly defended and Lord\nTywin Lannister\n to be too cunning by half. Theon asks what kingdom Balon means to carve out instead, but realizes\nhe already knows \nthe answer\n.\nNavigation:\nDavos I\n ←\nTheon I\n→ \nDaenerys I\n↓\nTheon II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 12: Daenerys I\nPlace(s): \nThe \nRed Waste\n - \nVaes Tolorro\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys X\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nTheon I\n ←\nDaenerys I\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nDaenerys II\nDaenerys Targaryen\n decides to follow the \nred comet\n deep into the \nred waste\n to protect her newborn \ndragons\n. Many\nof her \nkhalasar\n die before they find shelter in a \nruined city\n. There, Ser \nJorah Mormont\n tells her about his second\nwife, \nLynesse Hightower\n. While her people rest, Daenerys sends her three \nbloodriders\n to scout, and \nJhogo\n returns\nwith three strangers from the great city of \nQarth\n.\nSynopsis\nDaenerys Targaryen\n commands her small \nkhalasar\n to follow the \nred comet\n the \nDothraki\n have named \nshierak qiya\n,\nthe Bleeding Star. The old men mutter that it is a bad omen, but it appeared the \nnight\n they cremated her husband\nKhal\n \nDrogo\n and hatched her \ndragons\n, so Daenerys considers it the herald of her coming. Her handmaid \nDoreah\nexplains that only the grim and terrible \nred lands\n lie in that direction, but Daenerys really has no choice. The other\nkhalasars\n hold sway to the north, the \nLhazareen\n to the south, and Khal \nPono\n is driving slaves west to \nSlaver's Bay\n.\nWhen Daenerys argues that Pono always spoke to her kindly, Ser \nJorah Mormont\n reminds her that Pono was the first\nto leave and will kill her now. She argues that she has dragons, but Jorah explains that the hatchlings would be easy\nto kill, though Pono is more likely to seize them, since a living dragon is priceless. Daenerys makes it clear they are\nhers and will never be taken while she lives, but Jorah insists she will not live long unless she goes where no one\nelse does. Mounted on her \nsilver mare\n and garbed in her white \nhrakkar\n pelt to cover her bald head, Daenerys\ncommands her people to follow the comet and no words are raised against it; she is the Unburnt and Mother of\nDragons, so her word is their law.\nThey ride by night, leaving a trail of dead horses because Pono, \nJhaqo\n, and the others have taken the best mounts.\nHer people are also the weak and unwanted, so Daenerys must project confidence and strength to encourage them.\nThree days into the march, the weakest of her people start to die.\nThere is little forage and less water in the red waste. When supplies run low, they are forced to live on horseflesh\nand the deaths\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4a8a612aca8ed04b9ec1738f1eda796fa86d508084ff076ef32071fd4e2c6065_v2"}
