The Kindly Man told her that they are not gods to judge who lives or dies, they are just\nservants of \nHim of Many Faces\n. He explains that they are death's instruments, not death itself.\nAs she goes out to beg, the waif helps her to look the part, putting on a blindfold and giving her pox mark scars to\nmake her look ugly. As she goes out into Braavos past the \nInn of the Green Eel\n, she goes over the areas where she\nhas begged in her mind. Arya crosses the Bloody Bridge and makes her way to \nPynto\n at the end of Ragman's Harbor\nnear the edge of the Drowned Town.\nShe hears that two Lysene pirate ships, the \nGoodheart\n and the \nElephant\n, were driven north by a storm and found\nwildlings\n at \nHardhome\n. The wildlings were eager to board the ships that were prophesied by the witch, and the\npirates took the women and children on board, yet meant to sell them as slaves. The \nGoodheart\n was damaged in\nanother storm and was forced to make for Braavos, where the \nSealord\n seized the ship since slave trade is forbidden\nin Braavos.\nArya regularly has wolf dreams, and it is revealed that she has also learned to enter a cat. She uses knowledge\ngained through the cat's eyes to impress the kindly man, telling him that she knows it has been him who is hitting her\nbut without mentioning the cat. Apparently this completes her blind training, because when she opens her eyes again\nshe sees a candle flame, and she has never seen anything so beautiful before.\nNavigation:\nCat of the Canals\nA Feast for Crows\n↑\nJon IX\n ←\nThe Blind Girl\n→ \nA Ghost in Winterfell\n↓\nThe Ugly Little Girl\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 46: A Ghost in\nWinterfell\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nThe Turncloak\n↑\nThe Blind Girl\n ←\nA Ghost in Winterfell\n→ \nTyrion X\n↓\nTheon I\nSynopsis\nOne of \nRoger Ryswell\n's men has been found dead at the inner wall of \nWinterfell\n. \nTheon\n hears Lord Roger Ryswell\ndeclare that he must've fallen off the wall drunk, but he suspects it might have been murder, as do some others.\nRoose Bolton\n and his host are still stuck inside \nWinterfell\n's walls due to the relentless snow storms. They expect\nStannis' forces to attack them, but have no idea how close he may be due to the storms. Tensions rise among the\npeople inside Winterfell, with no one quite certain whether it is a good idea to wait passively for Stannis or instead\nto pursue him outside. It doesn't help that food is somewhat scarce and distributed quite unevenly.\nHolly\n, one of Abel the Bard's washer women, sits down next to Theon, who is upset that she has touched him. She\nasks him about the crypts, and a mistrusting Theon comes to the conclusion that she, Abel, and the other women\nwant out of Winterfell. Theon sympathizes, but he fears the wrath of \nRamsay Bolton\n and prefers not to get involved.\nThe next morning \nAenys Frey\n's squire is found dead and naked outside in the snow. Later on that day another man, a\ncrossbowman sworn to \nHouse Flint\n, is found dead with a crushed skull, presumably from a horse kick.\nNevertheless, the suspicions and tensions keep growing to the point that open quarreling happens among the host's\nLords inside the Great Hall. Some are tired of waiting for Stannis and want to attack him. A fight nearly breaks out\nas \nSer Hosteen\n and \nAenys Frey\n blame \nWyman Manderly\n for the deaths of their three kin \nRhaegar\n, \nJared\n, and\nSymond\n. It almost comes to a duel before \nRoger Ryswell\n and \nBarbrey Dustin\n calm them down, though Roose does\nnothing throughout the near altercation and Theon sees something new in Roose's eyes for the first time: a hint of\nfear.\nSoon the newly rebuilt stable collapses, killing two men and twenty-six horses. Roose Bolton gives orders for the\nsurviving horses to be brought inside the walls of Winterfell.\nA more suspicious death is discovered, that of \nYellow Dick\n. His namesake is stuffed in his mouth so hard that three\nteeth have been broken. This death is taken more seriously as it cannot be confused with an accident and to boot he\nis one of Ramsay Bolton's \nBastard Boys\n. Theon considers that a \nhooded man\n whom he meets may be responsible for\nthe murder. Theon is later ushered to see Roose by \nSteelshanks Walton\n. Roose says that Theon has been seen where\nall the murders have occurred. Theon is freed from the suspicions due to his weakened physical and psychological\nstate, as remarked by Lady Dustin and Roger Ryswell. It is now however undeniable that someone has been\ncommitting murders, possibly at Stannis' behest. The resulting suspicion flames the tensions between the Freys and\nthe Northmen, who are reminded of their role at\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
