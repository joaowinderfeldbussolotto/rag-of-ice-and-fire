She arrives to find\nChiswyck talking, and does not want to interrupt because she might be hit. He is talking about when he was\nreturning from the \nTourney of the Hand\n with Ser Gregor, Raff, \nJoss Stilwood\n, and \nEggon\n. They stopped at an\nalehouse where the brewer did not stop talking. They knew better than to talk because the Mountain was seething\nover the joust with the \nKnight of Flowers\n. The brewer’s girl was serving, and they were touching her. Finally, Joss\nput his hand up her skirt, and she screamed, running to the kitchen. The brewer went to Ser Gregor and asked that\nhis men leave the girl alone. Ser Gregor had the girl brought before him, payed the brewer a silver, and raped her\nright there.Her brother ran in from the cellar and Raff stabbed him with a dirk. After Ser Gregor was done, \nTobbot\nand Chiswyck continued to rape her. Ser Gregor told the brewer the girl was not worth a silver, and demanded\nchange, and the brewer gave it to him. They all roar with laughter at the story while Arya sneaks away. When Weese\nlearns she did not ask about the mending, he beats her bloody.\nTwo days later she sees Jaqen H’ghar in the Barracks Hall. Ensuring that Weese is not around, she works her way\ndown to him filling wine cups until she reaches him and whispers “Chiswyck” in his ear. He gives no sign that he\nheard, and nothing happens until the third day, when she hears that a man fell off the wallwalk the previous night.\nSome are saying Harren’s ghost flung him down and Arya thinks that she is the ghost in Harrenhal and there is one\n\nless name on her list.\nNavigation:\nArya VI\n↑\nTyrion VII\n ←\nArya VII\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nArya VIII\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 31: Catelyn III\nPlace(s): \nOutside the walls of \nStorm's End\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn II\n↑\nArya VII\n ←\nCatelyn III\n→ \nSansa III\n↓\nCatelyn IV\nCatelyn\n meets with \nStannis Baratheon\n and \nRenly Baratheon\n in hopes of bringing the brothers to reason. She fails\nand learns that Stannis has sent a letter claiming that neither \nJoffery\n nor \nTommen\n are \nRobert Baratheon\n’s sons. Even\nthough there is no proof, she remembers that \nLysa\n claimed that \nCersei\n killed her husband. Catelyn asks Renly’s\nleave but is not given it—he wants her to see him victorious in the morning.\nSynopsis\nHallis Mollen\n announces to \nCatelyn\n that they are the first to arrive at an area where the trees have been cut down by\nStannis Baratheon\n’s foragers to build siege equipment. Ser \nWendel Manderly\n tells Catelyn that this is not their fight\nand Catelyn replies that she was sent here by \nRobb Stark\n and for the good of the realm it must be done, but forging a\npeace between the brothers will not be easy; she would prefer to be with her dying father \nHoster Tully\n in \nRiverrun\n or\nback in \nWinterfell\n. In the distance she can see \nStorm's End\n and Stannis’ army looking small and insignificant under\nits walls.\nCatelyn thinks about the history of Storm’s End and of the love between the first Storm King, \nDurran\n, and \nElenei\n,\nthe daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. After the wedding, Elenei yielded her maidenhood and\nimmortality. Her parents unleashed storm and wind to destroy Durran’s hold, killing all but Durran and his wife,\nwho had protected him within her arms. It was the seventh castle he built that managed to withstand the storms. It is\nsaid that this castle was built with the help of the \nchildren of the forest\n or a child that became known as \nBrandon the\nBuilder\n.\nStannis is the first to arrive with a \nRed Priestess\n as his standard bearer; Catelyn knows that \nRenly\n will be last.\nStannis expresses his surprise to find her here, and gives his condolences for her husband \nEddard Stark\n, though he\nnotes Stark was no friend of his. Stannis is not grateful for Eddard’s part in breaking the siege, saying it was on\nRobert Baratheon\n’s command. He holds it against Eddard that he took the position of \nHand of the King\n, which he\ndid not even want. Stannis tells her that regardless of his feelings for her husband, Catelyn will have justice for his\nmurder; she responds that Renly promised the same, but she would prefer her daughters back. Stannis promises that\nher daughters will be found when he takes King's Landing. Catelyn thinks his tone implies dead or alive, and tells\nhim that King’s Landing is closer to \nDragonstone\n, but he is at Storm’s End. He replies that he needs the power of the\nsouthron lords to take King’s Landing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5cc32f288011df6ce638a959a3c07f2130db1abae04c0d89c2a5749493d5c8f3_v2"}
