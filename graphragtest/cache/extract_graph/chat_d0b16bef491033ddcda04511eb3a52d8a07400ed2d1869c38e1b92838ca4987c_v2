Their governess, \nSepta\nMordane\n, coos over Princess \nMyrcella\n's needlework, which Arya thinks is also crooked. Sansa is whispering with\nJeyne Poole\n and \nBeth Cassel\n. When Arya asks what they are whispering about she is told it is about how handsome\nPrince Joffrey is, and that he has complimented Sansa and is going to marry her. Arya points out that \nJon Snow\nthinks Joffrey looks like a girl. Sansa laments that Jon gets jealous because he is a \nbastard\n but Arya defends him,\ndrawing the septa's attention to her.\nSepta Mordane inspects Arya's stitches and pronounces her dissatisfaction. Humiliated, Arya bolts for the door,\nstopping only long enough to be forced to bow to Princess Myrcella. Arya wishes she had some of her sister's skill\nand beauty. She has her father‚Äôs looks, not the beauty of their mother like Sansa. Jeyne used to call her \"Horseface\",\nwhich was all the more hurtful because the only thing that Arya could do better than Sansa was ride. That and\nmanage a household since Sansa has no head for figures.\nArya finds her direwolf pup \nNymeria\n waiting for her and together they go to watch the boys sparring in the practice\nyard, not daring to go back to her room where she would be found and punished. On the covered bridge overlooking\nthe yard, Arya comes across Jon Snow seated on a sill with \nGhost\n, watching the fighting below. She sits down\nbeside him and they watch together.\nIn the yard below, heavily-padded \nBran\n and Prince \nTommen\n are fighting each other with wooden swords under the\nwatchful eye of Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, the master-at-arms. The group of spectators includes \nRobb\n and \nTheon\n. Jon\ncomments that swords are a bit more exhausting than needlework, but Arya responds that they are also more fun.\nArya remembers thinking when she was little that she was a bastard like Jon because they were the only children to\ntake after their father. When Arya asks why Jon is not down in the yard with the others, Jon explains that bastards\nare not allowed to damage princes, only trueborn swords can do that. Arya says she could fight as well as Bran who\nis only seven while she is nine, but Jon says she doesn't have enough strength for a longsword.\nJon points out that the newly-arrived Prince \nJoffery\n is wearing a sigil that has both the stag and lion on it, giving his\nmother\n‚Äôs \nLannister\n sigil equality to the royal \nBaratheon\n sigil. Jon suggests that Arya should wear a combination sigil\nfor the \nStarks\n and \nTullys\n, but Arya jokes that a wolf with a trout in its mouth would look silly. She questions why a\ngirl would need a sigil if she isn't allowed to fight. Jon shrugs that girls get the sigils but not the swords, while\nbastards get the swords but not the sigils.\nBelow, Bran has knocked Tommen down and Ser Rodrik calls Robb and Joffrey for a bout. Joffrey acts as if it is\nbeneath his dignity to fight Starks with practice swords. He suggests real swords and Robb readily accepts. Jon\ncomments to Arya that Joffrey truly is a \"little shit\". Ser Rodrik states that he will only allow blunted tourney\nswords. Joffrey's scarred bodyguard \nSandor Clegane\n remarks that he killed a man with a real sword when he was\nonly twelve. Joffrey makes a few more condescending remarks that enrage Robb, then feigns a yawn and leaves\nwith Tommen. Jon encourages Arya to go to her room and face her punishment. Arya insists it is not fair, but Jon\nsays that nothing is fair as he walks away with Ghost. Arya returns to her room to find not only Septa Mordane, but\nalso her mother.\n\nNavigation:\nCatelyn II\n ‚Üê\nArya I\n‚Üí \nBran II\n‚Üì\nArya II\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 8: Bran II\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran I\n‚Üë\nArya I\n ‚Üê\nBran II\n‚Üí \nTyrion I\n‚Üì\nBran III\nBran\n is climbing the towers of \nWinterfell\n when he discovers \nCersei\n and \nJaime\n \nLannister\n making love and talking\nabout the danger \nhis father\n poses.
