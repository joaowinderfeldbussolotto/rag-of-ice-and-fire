The northerners are being pushed against the hills\nand pelted by arrows. Finally, Bronn rides up and Tyrion sees his father ride by with the reserves to break the\nnortherners. Tyrion finds the remnants of his clansmen, of whom perhaps half, including \nConn\n and \nUlf son of Umar\n,\nare dead.\nTyrion searches for his father and finds him sipping wine as his armor is removed. Lord Tywin tells him that his\nclansmen fought well. Tyrion asks if that surprised him and if they were supposed to be butchered. Lord Tywin\nadmits that he expected the left to collapse, hoping that Robb Stark would press into the breach where they might\ncapture him. Tyrion demands to know why he was not informed. His father declares that a feigned rout is always\nless convincing and that he is not in the habit of trusting men who consort with \nsavages\n and \nsellswords\n. Lord Tywin\ncontinues that the Stark boy proved more cautious than expected, but it is a victory. Then Tywin notes that Tyrion is\nwounded and Tyrion asks that he call for his \nmaesters\n.\nAt that moment, Ser Addam Marbrand rides up with the news that Lord \nCerwyn\n, Ser \nWylis Manderly\n, \nHarrion\n\nKarstark\n, and four \nFreys\n were captured and Lord \nHalys Hornwood\n killed. The bad news follows: Lord \nRoose Bolton\nhas escaped, and Robb has crossed with most of his horse at the Twins and is riding hard for \nRiverrun\n. Tyrion\nremembers his father’s words that the Stark boy would be more brave than wise and thinks that he would laugh if it\ndidn't hurt so much.\nNavigation:\nTyrion VII\n↑\nDaenerys VII\n ←\nTyrion VIII\n→ \nCatelyn X\n↓\nTyrion IX\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 63: Catelyn X\nPlace(s): \nthe \nWhispering Wood\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn IX\n↑\nTyrion VIII\n ←\nCatelyn X\n→ \nDaenerys VIII\n↓\nCatelyn XI\nRobb Stark\n has managed to lead his host to \nRiverrun\n without detection. Now \nCatelyn\n waits with her guards as her\nson leads his host to \nambush\n Ser \nJaime Lannister\n. Once the battle is over, Robb returns with Jaime as a captive.\nHowever, the death of several of Robb's party mars the sweetness of the victory.\nSynopsis\nCatelyn\n is protected by thirty men under the command of \nHallis Mollen\n, \nWinterfell\n's captain of the \nguard\n, as \nRobb\n’s\nhost waits to descend upon Ser \nJaime Lannister\n in the \nWhispering Wood\n. Robb had wanted to leave her fifty guards\nand Catelyn had only wanted ten, so neither of them left happy.\nRobb’s army rode hard from the \nTwins\n to catch Jaime by surprise. Along the way, they were joined by the\nMallisters\n and some of the forces scattered after \nEdmure’s\n \ndefeat\n, but Ser Jaime Lannister still outnumbers them\nthree to one. However, in order to besiege \nRiverrun\n the \nLannisters\n were forced to separate their twelve thousand foot\nand two or three thousand horse into three camps separated by rivers, which leaves them vulnerable. In addition,\nCatelyn’s uncle, Ser \nBrynden\n, led a screening force of three hundred picked men to kill the few outriders that Jaime\nbothered to post, allowing their advance to remain secret.\nBefore they face the siege, however, Robb and his men have concocted an elaborate trap. Unable to endure the\nboredom of a siege, Jaime has personally ridden out three times to chase raiders. To exploit this, Robb sent a few\nhundred men with \nTully\n banners to lure Jaime and his men into an ambush in the narrow valley of the Whispering\nWood.\nAs she waits, Catelyn realizes that she is again waiting for a man who has promised to return from war, as she has\ndone all her life. First, she waited for \nher father\n when she was young. Then it was for \nBrandon Stark\n, who never\ncame back. Then she waited for \nNed Stark\n, who left a fortnight after he married her to fight in \nRobert's Rebellion\n. At\nleast Ned left her pregnant with Robb, whom she must wait for now.\nRobb shows no fear as the battle approaches, but Catelyn still fears for the life of her son, remembering him as a\nbabe at her breast. As Robb’s squire \nOlyvar Frey\n helps with his shield and helm, Catelyn sees a tall young knight\nappear where her son had stood. Robb leaves her to let his men see him before the battle, as his father had once\nrecommended, with his \ndirewolf\n \nGrey Wind\n shadowing him.\nWhile she waits, Catelyn hears \nsnow shrikes\n, which remind her of Winterfell. Suddenly, horns blow and arrows fly\nas the trap closes. Catelyn can initially see the moonlight on the lances, but soon she can only hear the sounds of the\nbattle in the Whispering Wood\n. Eventually the sounds fade, and then Robb returns on a different horse with the\nblood\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
