Yoren claimed it should not be too hard to pass as a boy; the hardest part would\nbe passing her water in the woods alone.\nThere are 30 of them; some of the recruits are orphan boys recruited with promises of food and clothing, but others\nare criminals from the dungeons under the \nRed Keep\n. The most frightening are the three from the \nblack cells\n, whom\nYoren keeps chained in the back of a wagon. The five wagons contain supplies for the Wall: hides, bars of pig iron,\na cage of ravens, cloth, books, paper, ink, \nsourleaf\n, oil, medicine, and spices.\nThe gates of \nKing's Landing\n were easy to pass, just as Yoren claimed. The \nLannister\n guards were searching for the\nhighborn daughter of the \nHand of the King\n, not a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Yoren called one of them by\nname and they were waved through. As they were leaving, Arya wished that \nBlackwater Rush\n would rise and wash\naway the city until she remembered \nher sister\n would be washed away, too. Instead, she decided to wish for\nWinterfell.\nYoren was wrong about passing water being the hardest part. The men ignore her, but the orphan boys Lommy\nGreenhands and \nHot Pie\n take her silence to mean she is frightened, stupid, or deaf. Arya is two years younger and\nquite a bit smaller than them. One morning, Lommy and Hot Pie begin questioning Arya about her sword, “\nNeedle\n,”\nwondering where she got it. Hot Pie sarcastically suggests that maybe she was a squire, but Lommy disagrees and\nargues that Needle is probably not even a real sword. Arya angrily shouts back that it is castle-forged steel, but this\nonly gives rise to claims that she stole it. This angers Arya even more because Needle was a gift from her bastard\nbrother \nJon Snow\n, and she will not let them call him a thief.\nThen Hot Pie gets the idea that he can steal Needle from her and Lommy encourages him. Hot Pie’s declaration that\nshe doesn’t even know how to use a sword takes Arya back to the stable boy she stabbed during her \nescape\n from the\nRed Keep\n, but she doesn't mention the incident. The boys continue to mock her, saying that she is going to cry and\nwet her pants.\nThe Bull\n—an older boy with shaggy black hair and a bull-motif helmet—tells them to let her be, but Hot Pie\n\ncontinues. Arya attempts to diffuse the situation by offering to surrender her wooden practice sword, but Hot Pie\nthreatens to beat her up like he did another boy and reaches for Needle. Arya uses her practice sword to whack Hot\nPie’s donkey. The animal bucks and throws Hot Pie to the ground. Arya dismounts and breaks his nose with her\npractice sword before turning on Lommy, who cowers away in fear. The Bull shouts a warning and Arya turns to\nface Hot Pie. The injured boy throws a rock at her, but Arya ducks and closes the distance to strike him again on the\nhand, cheek, knee, and back of the head. Dazed and wounded, Hot Pie attempts to charge her, but Arya slips into a\nWater Dancer\n pose and stabs the boy in the groin.\nBy the time Yoren pulls her off, Arya has hit Hot Pie a dozen more times and the boy’s pants are brown and smelly.\nYoren drags her off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering. There he orders her to drop her breeches\nand scream loudly, then whacks her several times with her own stick sword. Arya does not want to scream, but\ncannot help it, and her thighs and cheeks are ablaze with pain.\nWhen he is finished, Yoren tells her that if she ever uses her stick sword on one of her companions again she will\nget twice what she gives. Yoren also explains that however much her punishment hurt, Hot Pie is feeling much\nworse. He points out that Hot Pie and Lommy had no part in her father’s death and hitting them won’t bring him\nback. Arya says she knows that. Yoren goes on to explain that he was set to leave when he received a message to\nwait for Lord Eddard, who was supposed to be allowed to take the black, only something went queer. Arya blames\nKing \nJoffrey\n and declares someone should kill him. Yoren replies that someone will, but not him and not her.\nAfterward, Arya is unable to sit a donkey for several days, but Hot Pie is unable to do anything but lie in the back of\na wagon for even longer and Lommy stays as far away from her as possible. The Bull points out that Lommy\ntwitches whenever she looks at him now. Arya does not answer since it seems safer not to talk. That night, while\nlooking up at the sky, the Bull calls the \nred comet\n the “Red Sword,” saying that it looks like a sword fresh from the\nforge. Arya can see it as a sword as well, but to her it is her father’s greatsword \nIce\n, covered with her father’s blood\nas it was after his head was cut off.\nWhen she finally falls asleep, Arya dreams of Winterfell. She longs to see \nher mother\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RED KEEP<|>GEO<|>A dungeon location under the Red Keep where criminals are held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>A city with gates that were easily passed by Yoren and his group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK CELLS<|>GEO<|>A part of the Red Keep where the most frightening prisoners are kept)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKWATER RUSH<|>GEO<|>A river near King's Landing that Arya wished would rise and wash away the city)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>A location Arya longs for and dreams about, associated with her family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANNISTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A noble house whose guards were searching for the Hand of the King's daughter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAND OF THE KING<|>PERSON<|>A high-ranking official whose highborn daughter was being sought by the Lannister guards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>A young girl disguised as a boy, traveling with Yoren and involved in conflicts with other recruits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOREN<|>PERSON<|>A man leading a group of recruits to the Wall, including Arya and others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOMMY GREENHANDS<|>PERSON<|>An orphan boy who mocks Arya and is later intimidated by her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT PIE<|>PERSON<|>An orphan boy who mocks Arya and attempts to steal her sword, leading to a violent confrontation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEEDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sword given to Arya by her brother Jon Snow, which she fiercely protects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JON SNOW<|>PERSON<|>Aryl's bastard brother who gifted her the sword Needle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BULL<|>PERSON<|>An older boy who intervenes in conflicts and later shares observations with Arya)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING JOFFREY<|>PERSON<|>A king blamed by Arya for her father's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED COMET<|>EVENT<|>A celestial event visible in the sky, interpreted by the Bull as the 'Red Sword')\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A greatsword associated with Arya's father, symbolizing his death)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>RED KEEP<|>Arya escaped from the Red Keep, which is a significant event in her journey<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>KING'S LANDING<|>Arya passed through King's Landing while traveling with Yoren<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Arya dreams of and longs for Winterfell, her family's home<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>JON SNOW<|>Jon Snow is Arya's brother who gifted her the sword Needle<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>NEEDLE<|>Needle is Arya's sword, a gift from her brother Jon Snow<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>HOT PIE<|>Arya violently confronts Hot Pie after he attempts to steal her sword<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>LOMMY GREENHANDS<|>Arya intimidates Lommy Greenhands after her confrontation with Hot Pie<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>THE BULL<|>The Bull intervenes in Arya's conflicts and later shares observations with her<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>KING JOFFREY<|>Arya blames King Joffrey for her father's death<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>RED COMET<|>Arya sees the red comet as her father's greatsword Ice, symbolizing his death<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>ICE<|>Arya associates the red comet with her father's greatsword Ice<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT PIE<|>LOMMY GREENHANDS<|>Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands mock Arya together<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>ARYA<|>Yoren leads Arya and punishes her for her violent actions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>HAND OF THE KING<|>Yoren was supposed to wait for Lord Eddard, the Hand of the King<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
