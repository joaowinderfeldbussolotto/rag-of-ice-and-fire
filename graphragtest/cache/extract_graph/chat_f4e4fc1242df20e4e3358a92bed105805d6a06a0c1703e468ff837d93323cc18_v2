Because of Osha’s good\nbehavior, her chains have been removed, but the shackles remain to show she is not totally trusted. She carries Bran\nin her arms, but he does not mind.\nThe vault seems very dark and gloomy. Summer and Osha seem uncomfortable. When Bran states that the men\nrepresented by the granite statues were the \nKings of Winter\n, Osha tells him that winter has no king; if he had seen a\nwinter he would know. They proceed down the long corridor, past the statues, but Summer refuses to leave the steps.\nBran tells the accomplishments of the different lords and kings: \nJon Stark\n, \nRickard Stark\n, \nTheon Stark\n, \nBrandon the\nShipwright\n, \nBrandon the Burner\n, \nRodrik Stark\n, \nTorrhen Stark\n, and \nCregan Stark\n. When they get to the end with the\nstatues of \nBrandon Stark\n, \nLyanna Stark\n and Lord \nRickard Stark\n, Luwin sticks his arm into the future tomb of\nEddard, and \nShaggydog\n springs out and savages Maester Luwin's arm.\nBran calls for Summer, who slams into Shaggydog, knocking the wolf off Luwin. Osha goes to assist Luwin. As the\nwolves fight, Rickon appears at the mouth of Eddard’s tomb, telling Luwin to leave his father be. When Bran tells\nRickon father is not there, Rickon states that he saw him last night, and that he is coming home. Luwin, now looking\nunsure, tells Rickon that Shaggydog was supposed to be chained. Rickon replies that he does not like to be chained,\nand Luwin states that he is now the third man Shaggydog has savaged and it will only be a matter of time before he\nkills someone. Bran calmly states they will wait in Maester Luwin's tower, which Luwin states is quite impossible.\nOsha replies that Bran is the lord. Rickon agrees to come if Shaggy comes too. Maester Luwin reluctantly follows.\nThey enter Maester Luwin's cluttered turret, where Osha bandaged the maester's wound, following his instructions.\n\nLuwin tries to explain to the boys about the logic of them both dreaming the same dream. He says that Rickon is too\nyoung to understand, to which Rickon states that he is four. Then he tells Bran that he is old enough to know that\ndreams are just dreams. Osha adds in that some dreams are just dreams and some are not; the \nchildren of the forest\ncould teach him something about dreams.\nBran starts to go into the stories that \nOld Nan\n told about the children of the forest: they knew the songs of the trees,\nflew like birds, swam like fish, talked to animals, and made beautiful music. The maester says that a man who trusts\nin spells duels with a glass sword. Luwin takes out several arrowheads made of \ndragonglass\n, or \nobsidian\n, which the\nchildren of the forest forged. He tells them that the children used shirts of woven leaves and greaves of bark in place\nof armor and carried blades of obsidian; Osha comments that they still do. Bran and Rickon each take some\narrowheads.\n'The children lived during the \nDawn Age\n, before the coming of men in the land now called the \nSeven Kingdoms\n.\nThey lived in the depths of the woods, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Their wise men were called\ngreenseers\n and carved the faces in the \nweirwoods\n to watch over the forest. No one knows how long they reigned or\nwhere they came from.' Twelve thousand years ago, the \nFirst Men\n crossed the \nBroken Arm\n of \nDorne\n before it was\nbroken. The First Men were mounted, tall of stature, and wielded bronze weapons.\nThe First Men chopped down the weirwood trees to build holdfasts, and the enraged children of the forest started a\nwar. The \ngreenseers\n supposedly used dark magic to make the sea rise and break the landmass that is now the broken\narm of \nDorne\n. Finally, a truce was called and the leaders of both races met on the \nIsle of Faces\n in the \nGods Eye\n.\nAfter the \nPact\n was forged, the greenmen formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces and the First Men eventually\nadopted the \nold gods\n worshiped by the children. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age and began the \nAge of\nHeroes\n. The Pact started 4000 years of friendship between the children and the First Men. While the kingdoms of\nthe First Men endured, so did the Pact, all through the Age of Heroes, the \nLong Night\n, and the birth of the Seven\nKingdoms.\nEventually the \nAndal\n invaders came with steel, fire, and the seven-pointed star of the \nnew gods\n. The war lasted for\nhundreds of years, and the Andals burned most of the weirwoods remaining in the south, slaughtering the children\nwhere they found them. The children fled north. During the story, Osha adds that there are still children north of the\nWall\n, and also giants, and other old races; Maester Luwin is not happy with Osha filling the two boys with folly.\nLuwin’s tale is cut off when the two \ndirewolves\n start howling. Now Bran is sure that he knew it.
