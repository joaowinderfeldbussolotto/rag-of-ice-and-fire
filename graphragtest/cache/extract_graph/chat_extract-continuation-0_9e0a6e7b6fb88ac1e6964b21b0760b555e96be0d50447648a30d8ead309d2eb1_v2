He is atop a\ncliff, and oversees thousands of men training for combat. He also sees \nmammoths\n with \ngiants\n riding them. Suddenly,\nan \neagle\n soars out of the sky coming straight for him. Jon awakens shouting Ghost’s name. The others hear his\nshout, and he tells them what he saw. Qhorin calls it a wolf dream, and Ebben calls Jon a \nskinchanger\n. Qhorin,\nhowever, does not balk at the thought of wargs and giants during a time when the dead walk and the trees have eyes\nagain. They set out just before dusk, and spot an eagle watching them, well out of bowshot.\nSoon after, they find Ghost wounded and dress the direwolf's wounds. Qhorin tells them they must head back to the\nFist\n, for they have been seen by the eagle which they fear is a skinchanger as well. They begin the journey back\nthrough the \nSkirling Pass\n without lighting any fires despite the cold.

Tyrion goes to tell \nCersei\n the news, wanting very much to see her reaction. She tells him she could have\nfrightened Bran into silence, but \nJaime\n reacted without thinking. Tyrion tells her that they must take good care of\nSansa\n, because with two of her sons dead, Lady \nCatelyn\n might decide to kill Jaime. Cersei warns him that he trusts\nVarys too much, telling him that the Spider feeds them all information to make them think they would be helpless\nwithout him. She reveals that Varys told her Tyrion meant to take \nthe Hound\n from \nJoffrey\n, and Tyrion explains he\nneeds Sandor Clegane and Ser \nBalon Swann\n to lead sorties in the upcoming battle. Tyrion also informs her he means\nto give Joffrey a small command far out of the main fighting, so that the men can see their King leading them.\nCersei then springs a surprise on Tyrion, bringing out who she thinks is Tyrion’s whore, \nAlayaya\n. The girl has been\nbadly beaten, and the Queen reveals she did this because \na Lannister\n always pays her debts, and Tyrion has been\nconspiring against her since he arrived. Tyrion pretends to be horrified, but is relieved that his sister had not found\nShae\n. Cersei tells him the whore will not be harmed so long as \nTommen\n remains safe, but Tyrion bluffs by saying he\nwill have Tommen treated the same way the girl is. Alayaya does not give Tyrion away, and goes along with the\nwhole thing. Tyrion then threatens to pay Cersei back for what she did, when she least expects it. Having lost, the\nQueen shouts at him to get out. He finds Shae in his room, having come through the secret passage, but she was\nblindfolded by Varys and does not know where the entrance lies.\nNavigation:\nTyrion XI\n↑\nJon VII\n ←\nTyrion XII\n→ \nCatelyn VII\n↓\nTyrion XIII\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 55: Catelyn VII\nPlace(s): \nRiverrun\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn VI\n↑\nTyrion XII\n ←\nCatelyn VII\n→ \nTheon V\n↓\nA Storm of Swords\nCatelyn I\nSynopsis\nCatelyn\n hears the celebration going on in \nRiverrun\n, but she sits alone with \nBrienne\n and desolate over the loss of her\ntwo young sons.
