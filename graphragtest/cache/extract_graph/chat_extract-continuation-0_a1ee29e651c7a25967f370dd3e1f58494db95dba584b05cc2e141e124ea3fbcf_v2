Varys says he now knows Ned to be loyal to the realm because he dissuaded the king from\nentering the melee. Varys also reveals that Cersei fears Ned because Robert will never harm him, not even at her\ncommand, whereas Robert would execute Varys in a twinkling at queen’s request since the king has little love for\nsneaks, spies, and eunuchs.\nNed argues that Robert must have other friends and that his brothers are surely loyal. Varys replies that hating the\nqueen and loving the king are not quite the same thing. Varys goes on to say that Ser Barristan loves his honor,\nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger. Varys adds that the Kingsguard are a\npaper shield: Ser \nBoros Blount\n and Ser \nMeryn Trant\n are the queen’s men, Ser Barristan is old, and the loyalties of\nthe rest are also suspect. Ned insists that they must warn Robert, but Varys reminds him that without proof they will\nonly lose. Ned insists that the plotters will try again, and Varys agrees, stating that together they might be able to\nstop them.\nAs he rises to leave, Varys reminds Ned to continue treating him with his accustomed contempt. As Varys reaches\nthe door, Ned asks how Jon Arryn died. Varys tells him that a rare and costly poison called the \nTears of Lys\n was\nused. Varys goes on to say that he suggested a taster, but Lord Arryn refused. When Ned asks who administered the\npoison, Varys claims that it was probably his squire, Ser \nHugh\n, who now lies dead. After \nLysa\n left for the \nEyrie\n,\nHugh remained and had the money to buy new armor.\nAs a final question, Ned asks Varys what Jon Arryn had been doing that led to his murder.

His attempts to convince Lady \nCatelyn\n of his innocence are interrupted when the \nVale mountain clans\n attack.\nDuring the fight, Tyrion saves Catelyn and afterwards he explains that \nLittlefinger\n’s accusation has a hole: Tyrion\nwould never bet against his \nfamily\n.\nSynopsis\nAs \nTyrion\n watches the \nsellsword\n \nChiggen\n butcher his horse he chalks up another debt owed to the \nStarks\n. The mare\nwas a gift from his brother \nJaime\n for his twenty-third name day. The sellsword \nBronn\n tells Tyrion that none of them\nwill go hungry, but Tyrion replies that he does not like eating horse, particularly his own horse. Bronn responds that\nthe \nDothraki\n like horse better than other meats. Tyrion reflects that maybe his horse is the lucky one, since he has\nmany more cold hard days ahead of him. As he walks away from the sellswords, Tyrion thinks back bitterly to the\nnight at the \ninn\n.\nWhen they took him captive his guard \nJyck\n had gone for his sword, but Tyrion had stopped him, knowing it would\nonly get them killed. Lady \nCatelyn\n showed the wounds on her hands all around, claiming they had been caused by\nTyrion's dagger during an attack on her son. All the people in the inn, who had been friendly enough before, started\nscreaming for his death. With only his men Jyck and \nMorrec\n to defend him, Tyrion had no choice but to surrender;\nhis other companion \nYoren\n, being of the \nNight's Watch\n, was sworn to take no part in such matters.\nLady Catelyn stated, often and loudly, that they were taking Tyrion to \nWinterfell\n for justice. Tyrion had looked over\nthe crowd and seen that things were not as bad as they seemed. Of the roughly fifty men in the common room,\nCatelyn Stark roused only a bare dozen. He announced that anyone who reported his capture to \nhis father\n would get\na rich reward. Ser \nRodrik\n then ordered the crowd to remain silent, and had Tyrion struggled not to laugh at the\nthought that Ser Rodrik was fool enough to believe they would.\nLady Catelyn then asked for help in bringing Tyrion to Winterfell, and was rewarded with several recruits. As they\nbundled him out of the inn he was not afraid, sure that they would never get him to Winterfell. Then they pulled a\nhood over his eyes and made a hard gallop through the rain away from the inn.\nIt was dawn and the rain had stopped when they finally pulled the hood off and Tyrion saw they were
