Aerys reigned for twelve years (during which Aemon took his vows as a maester) then died\nwithout issue and the throne passed to Aemon’s father Maekar I. During his father’s reign, Aemon’s eldest brother,\nDaeron \"the Drunken\"\n, died of a pox, leaving only \na feeble-minded daughter\n, and his second brother, \nAerion\nTargaryen\n, who killed himself by drinking \nwildfire\n, believing it would turn him into a \ndragon\n. Less than a year later,\nKing Maekar died in battle with an outlaw lord.\nA \nGreat Council\n was convened to decide on the succession. It passed over Aerion’s infant son and quietly offered\nthe throne to Maester Aemon, but Aemon chose to abide by his vows even after the \nHigh Septon\n offered to absolve\nhim. Therefore, his younger brother, \nAegon V Targaryen\n, was named king, and became known as \"the Unlikely\"\nbecause (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that\nthose dissatisfied with his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so he became a member of the Night’s Watch and\nremained at the Wall while his brother’s descendents ruled as kings until \nRobert's Rebellion\n put an end to the line of\nthe \nDragonkings\n.\nMormont’s raven begins repeating the word “king.” Jon notes that the bird seems to like the word, and jests that\nperhaps the raven believes Mormont should have a crown. Mormont declares that there are three kings already,\nwhich is two too many for his liking.\nJon asks why Mormont has told him all this about Maester Aemon. Mormont explains that Jon and Aemon have\nsomething in common: a king for a brother. Jon points out that they also share a vow. Mormont comments that if he\nhad a man for every vow he has seen broken the Wall would never lack for defenders. Jon says he always knew\nRobb would be Lord of Winterfell, but Mormont insists that a king is a different thing:\nThey will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and\ndie in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You’ll have no wife, nor will\nyou ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow.\nHim they’ll call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go\nunsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon... and I’ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it.\nJon asks what a bastard like himself might do if these facts did trouble him, but Mormont asks what Jon \nwill\n do. Jon\ndeclares that he will be troubled, and keep his vows.\n\nNavigation:\nJon IX\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nArya II\n ←\nJon I\n→ \nCatelyn I\n↓\nJon II\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 7: Catelyn I\nPlace(s): \nRiverrun\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn XI\nA Game of Thrones\n↑\nJon I\n ←\nCatelyn I\n→ \nTyrion II\n↓\nCatelyn II\nCatelyn Stark\n watches as her son \nKing\n \nRobb Stark\n presents his peace terms to his envoy Ser \nCleos Frey\n. Afterward,\nCatelyn argues with Robb over his refusal to exchange \nJaime Lannister\n and his plan to send \nTheon Greyjoy\n back to\nthe \nIron Islands\n. Later, Catelyn discusses the war with \nBrynden Tully\n and they plan an alliance with King \nRenly\nBaratheon\n.\nSynopsis\nAs they wait in \nRiverrun\n's Great Hall, \nCatelyn\n watches her son \nRobb\n restlessly adjust his new-forged crown several\ntimes, and remarks to herself that a crown is not easy to wear, especially for a boy of fifteen years.\nThe ancient crown of the \nKings of Winter\n was lost three centuries ago when \nTorrhen Stark\n submitted to \nAegon the\nConqueror\n, but the smiths have done well to match the descriptions: an open circlet of hammered bronze\nsurmounted by nine black iron spikes in the shape of longswords. There is no gold, or silver, or gems; bronze and\niron are the metals of winter, dark and strong.\nAs the guards bring in the captive, Robb lays his sword across his knees in the customary gesture of hostility. As Ser\nCleos Frey\n is forced to his knees, Catelyn reflects that he does not look like a \nLannister\n. Although his mother Lady\nGenna\n is sister to Lord \nTywin Lannister\n, Ser Cleos has inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of\nhis father, Ser \nEmmon Frey\n.\nRobb's sword glimmers faintly as he bids Ser Cleos to rise, but it is \nGrey Wind\n who frightens the knight.
