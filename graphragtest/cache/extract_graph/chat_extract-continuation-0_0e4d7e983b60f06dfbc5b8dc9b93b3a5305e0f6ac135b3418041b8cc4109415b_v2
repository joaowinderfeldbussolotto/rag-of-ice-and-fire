After a bath, Ser \nJorah Mormont\n arrives with a ship captain with news that King \nRobert\nBaratheon\n is dead and there is civil war in the \nSeven Kingdoms\n.\nSynopsis\nThere is a large celebration for their arrival at \nQarth\n apparent as \nDaenerys’\n \nkhalasar\n approaches the city and a\ncolumn of camelry rides from the city to provide her an honor guard. The warlock \nPyat Pree\n told Daenerys that\nQarth is the greatest city, a crossroads, and ancient. Upon seeing the city, Daenerys has to admit the city is\nmagnificent. It has three thick walls: the first is 30 feet high and made of red sandstone carved with animals, the\nsecond 40 feet high and made of granite carved with scenes of war, and the third 50 feet high, made of black marble\ncarved with scenes of sex. \nQartheen\n line the streets and balconies to watch them pass, black \nDrogon\n on her shoulder.\nThe women are in gowns that bare one breast, and the men wear beaded silk shirts while the children wear only\nsandals and paint. Daenerys thinks how the \nDothraki\n call these people “Milk Men\" for their skin and how \nKhal\nDrogo\n dreamed sacking the great city.\nThe merchant prince \nXaro Xhoan Daxos\n rides up on his camel, which the Dothraki horses shy away from. He tells\nDaenerys that if she desires anything she sees it is hers. Pyat Pree sings from her other side “Qarth itself is hers, she\nhas no need of baubles,” and she should come to the \nHouse of the Undying\n to drink wisdom and truth. Daenerys\ntells them both that she only wants the \nRed Keep\n in \nKing's Landing\n and if they want to give her gifts, to give her\nships and swords. Pyat states that it will be as she commands and the other complements her on her wisdom. Xaro\nXhoan Daxos warns her that warlocks are not to be trusted. The two continue to bicker until Ser \nJorah Mormont\nmutters in the common tongue “The crow calls the raven black,” that she should avoid both men, and that it would\nbe best to not linger here. Daenerys, however, wants their help in winning her throne.\nDaenerys expected something grand when Xaro Xhoan Daxos offered the hospitality of his home, but not a palace\nlarger than a market town, with an entire wing given over to her. He tells her that there will be a feast the next day\nwith delicacies and music, and the \nThirteen\n will come to do her honor. Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Pyat depart. The last\nof the three seekers, the shadowbinder \nQuaithe\n gives Daenerys a warning to beware of everyone, for they all lust for\nthe power of her dragons, and then departs.\nAfter Quaithe leaves, Ser Jorah states she is right, but he also does not trust her. Daenerys admits that she does not\nunderstand Quaithe. While the others shower her in promises, she has only cryptic words. It also concerns her that\nshe has not seen her face. Then Daenerys declares that they will keep their own watch, and will keep a sharp eye on\nthe dragons. After \nAggo\n confirms it will be done, she tells \nRakharo\n to use good men and women to explore the rest\nof Qarth since they have only seen the parts that the seekers wanted them to see. She then asks Ser Jorah to go to the\ndocks to get news of the \nSeven Kingdoms\n, and maybe find a ship to carry them home. Ser Jorah tells her the usurper\nwill kill her and wants to stay with her but she tells him that \nJhogo\n can guard her, and he has the languages and more\nexperience with the sea.\nAfter they leave, her handmaidens strip her of her travel stained silks and she bathes in a marble pool with golden\nfish. She wonders if the Red Keep has a pool like this with fragrant gardens, remembering \nViserys\n saying that the\n\nSeven Kingdoms are the most beautiful place in the world. She also thinks she no longer has Drogo’s khalasar\nbeh\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LORD TYWIN<|>PERSON<|>Lord Tywin is a highborn noble who commands respect and fear from others, including Weese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEESE<|>PERSON<|>Weese is an enforcer who works under Lord Tywin and is known for his cruelty and ability to detect defiance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>Arya is a character in the story, referenced in the navigation section)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYRION<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion is a character in the story, referenced in the navigation section)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAENERYS<|>PERSON<|>Daenerys is a key character who leads a khalasar and interacts with various factions in Qarth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QARTH<|>GEO<|>Qarth is a great city with three thick walls, known for its wealth, culture, and as a crossroads of trade)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XARO XHOAN DAXOS<|>PERSON<|>Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a merchant prince of Qarth who offers Daenerys hospitality and gifts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYAT PREE<|>PERSON<|>Pyat Pree is a warlock who invites Daenerys to the House of the Undying and offers cryptic advice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>PERSON<|>Ser Jorah Mormont is a knight and advisor to Daenerys, providing her with news and counsel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING ROBERT BARATHEON<|>PERSON<|>King Robert Baratheon is the deceased king of the Seven Kingdoms, whose death has led to civil war)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN KINGDOMS<|>GEO<|>The Seven Kingdoms is a region where civil war is ongoing following the death of King Robert Baratheon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DROGON<|>PERSON<|>Drogon is one of Daenerys' dragons, symbolizing her power and heritage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KHAL DROGO<|>PERSON<|>Khal Drogo was Daenerys' late husband and leader of the Dothraki, who dreamed of conquering Qarth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE OF THE UNDYING<|>GEO<|>The House of the Undying is a mysterious place in Qarth where Pyat Pree invites Daenerys to gain wisdom)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED KEEP<|>GEO<|>The Red Keep is a fortress in King's Landing that Daenerys seeks to claim as her own)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S LANDING<|>GEO<|>King's Landing is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, where the Red Keep is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE THIRTEEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Thirteen is a powerful group in Qarth that plans to honor Daenerys at a feast)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUAITHE<|>PERSON<|>Quaithe is a shadowbinder who warns Daenerys about the dangers of those around her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGGO<|>PERSON<|>Aggo is one of Daenerys' followers who confirms her orders and assists in her plans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAKHARO<|>PERSON<|>Rakharo is one of Daenerys' followers tasked with exploring Qarth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JHOGO<|>PERSON<|>Jhogo is one of Daenerys' followers who can guard her in Ser Jorah's absence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISERYS<|>PERSON<|>Viserys is Daenerys' late brother who spoke of the beauty of the Seven Kingdoms)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LORD TYWIN<|>WEESE<|>Weese works under Lord Tywin and enforces his rules with cruelty<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>QARTH<|>Daenerys arrives in Qarth with her khalasar and is celebrated by its people<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XARO XHOAN DAXOS<|>DAENERYS<|>Xaro Xhoan Daxos offers Daenerys hospitality and gifts in Qarth<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYAT PREE<|>DAENERYS<|>Pyat Pree invites Daenerys to the House of the Undying and offers cryptic advice<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SER JORAH MORMONT<|>DAENERYS<|>Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys and provides her with news and counsel<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>KHAL DROGO<|>Daenerys was married to Khal Drogo, who dreamed of conquering Qarth<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>RED KEEP<|>Daenerys seeks to claim the Red Keep in King's Landing as her own<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>KING'S LANDING<|>Daenerys aims to conquer King's Landing and the Red Keep<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>THE THIRTEEN<|>The Thirteen plan to honor Daenerys at a feast in Qarth<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUAITHE<|>DAENERYS<|>Quaithe warns Daenerys about the dangers of those around her in Qarth<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGGO<|>DAENERYS<|>Aggo follows Daenerys' orders and assists in her plans<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAKHARO<|>DAENERYS<|>Rakharo is tasked by Daenerys to explore Qarth<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JHOGO<|>DAENERYS<|>Jhogo guards Daenerys in Ser Jorah's absence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAENERYS<|>VISERYS<|>Viserys is Daenerys' late brother who spoke of the Seven Kingdoms<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
