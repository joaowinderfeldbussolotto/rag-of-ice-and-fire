Qhorin commands Stonesnake to\ntell Mormont all that \nJon\n saw: that he faces giants and wargs and worse, and that the trees have eyes again. That\nnight, the Halfhand asks Jon if his sword is sharp, and makes the young man recite his oath with him. Qhorin then\ncommands Jon to yield when they are overtaken, and not to balk no matter what the wildlings ask him to do to prove\nhimself. Jon is appalled at the suggestion, but Qhorin tells him to go among the \nWildlings\n and learn what they plan,\nwatch what they do, but to remember who he is and to return to Mormont when he has learned what the wildlings\nare searching for.
