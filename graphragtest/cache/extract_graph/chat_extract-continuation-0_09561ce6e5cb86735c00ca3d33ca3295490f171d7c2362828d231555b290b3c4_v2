Sam explains that the most important documents were copied\nover when needed, and the oldest have likely been copied half a hundred times. Jon says there is no need to copy\nthis one, which is only a list of goods. Sam seems fascinated, but Jon wonders who would care how much pickled\ncod men ate six hundred years ago. Sam insists that he would, since it can tell them how many men were in the\nNight’s Watch\n, and how they lived, and what they ate. Jon responds that they ate food and lived as he and Sam do.\nSam disagrees and claims that the vault is a treasure trove. Jon is dubious: to him treasure means gold, silver, and\njewels. Sam has also found works even the \nCitadel\n does not have: drawings of \nweirwood\n faces, thousand year old\ncounts of the seasons, scrolls from old \nValyria\n, and even a book about the language of the children of the forest.\nJon assures Sam the books will still be here when they return, but Sam replies, “If we return.” Jon tries to reassure\nSam by pointing out that Mormont is taking 200 seasoned men (most of them rangers), and \nQhorin Halfhand\n will\njoin them with 100 more from the \nShadow Tower\n. He insists Sam will be as safe as back at \nHorn Hill\n, but Sam\nreplies that he was never very safe there either.\nJon thinks it a cruel joke that \nPyp\n and \nToad\n (who want to go) are to remain behind while Sam (the self-proclaimed\ncoward) must go in Maester Aemon’s place to tend the two cages of ravens. Sam argues that Jon or \nGrenn\n could\ncare for the ravens, and Jon can write messages as well as he can. Jon insists that he has his own duties as the Lord\nCommander’s steward. He reminds Sam that he said the vows, but Sam says that a brother of the Night’s Watch\nshould not be so scared. Jon insists they are all scared, and they should be with so many rangers disappearing in the\nlast two years, but what matters is how they face it. Then he offers to help gather up the maps and they depart the\n\nlibrary.\nThe vault opens onto one of the underground passages called the wormwalks, which bind Castle Black together in\nwinter. Jon thinks of the \nwhite raven\n that came to Maester Aemon, and knows winter will come soon. He remembers\nthe last winter, which was short and mild, but he can feel that this one will be different. By the time they reach the\nsurface, Sam is out of breath. The sight of \nthe Wall\n reminds Jon that it marks the end of the world, and tomorrow\nthey are going beyond it.\nThe morning sky is streaked by clouds but the \nred comet\n is still visible behind them, even by day. The black brothers\nhave dubbed it “Mormont’s Torch,” claiming (only half in jest) that the gods have sent it to light the way through\nthe \nhaunted forest\n. The castle seems deserted with so many gone to the brothel in \nMole's Town\n. Grenn is among\nthem, since Pyp and \nHalder\n and Toad offered to buy him his first woman. They invited Jon and Sam as well, but Jon\ninsisted on keeping his vow of celibacy and Sam is as frightened of whores as he is of everything else.\nAs they pass the \nsept\n, they hear a hymn being sung. Jon notes that on the eve of battle some men want whores and\nsome want gods. He wonders who feels better after. The sept tempts him no more than the brothel; the \nSeven\n have\nno power beyond the Wall, but the nameless \nold gods\n whom Jon worships will be waiting there.\nOutside the armory, Ser \nEndrew Tarth\n is training the six new recruits brought in the previous night. Ser Endrew is a\ngentler master-at-arms than Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n, but his lessons can still raise bruises. Sam winces at the sight, but\nJon watches closely. From the door of the armory, the one-armed smith \nDonal Noye\n asks Jon’s opinion of the\nrecruits. Jon declares they smell of summer and asks where \nConwy\n recruited them. Noye says it was a dungeon near\nGulltown\n and labels the recruits as a brigand, a barber, a \nbeggar\n, \ntwo\n \norphans\n, and a \nboy whore\n. Jon replies that they\nwill do; he and Sam did.\nNoye asks Jon if he has heard that his brother \nRobb Stark\n is now a \nking\n. Jon admits that last night in the common\nroom there was talk of little else. Jon is still unsure how he feels about the brother he grew up with becoming a king\nwhile he remains on the Wall, but he tells Noye that Robb will make a good king. Noye is not so sure and declares\nthat once he might have said the same of \nRobert Baratheon\n, but Robert was never the same after he put on the\ncrown. Noye confirms that he forged Robert’s warhammer and claims he knew the \nBaratheon\n brothers as well as\nanyone. The smith compares Robert to a sword: made for fighting and prone to rust if left unused. When Jon asks if\nRobert’s brothers are the same, Noye considers for a moment then declares:\nRobert was the true steel. \nStannis\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
