Shae would then be able to access the \nTower of the Hand\n through a secret passage,\nwhich Tyrion is surprised to learn exists.\nVarys then attempts to tell Tyrion how Ser \nCortnay\n died, and when he suggests it was magic, Tyrion disbelieves\nhim. Varys recounts the story of how he came to be a eunuch: that he was a member of a mummers’ troupe, and that\none day in \nMyr\n a certain man bought Varys from his master. The sorcerer castrated Varys, and burned the parts,\ncreating a blue flame from which a voice spoke in a language he didn’t comprehend. Varys claims he has hated\nmagic since that day, and means to see Stannis dead if the man practiced magic.\nTyrion is somewhat skeptical, beliving it more likely that Stannis has hired a skilled assassin from the \nFree Cities\n,\nmusing on how he used to dream of being rich enough one day to hire a \nFaceless Man\n to kill his sister. Tyrion's\ngreater concern is that Stannis is now bringing his army to bear against King's Landing, and he is the only one\nstanding in the way of Stannis's victory. With the city's people's hatred for \nHouse Lannister\n and himself in particular\nat its highest, defeating Stannis seems unlikely.\nNavigation:\nTyrion IX\n↑\nJon V\n ←\nTyrion X\n→ \nCatelyn VI\n↓\n\nTyrion XI\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 45: Catelyn VI\nPlace(s): \nRiverrun\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn V\n↑\nTyrion X\n ←\nCatelyn VI\n→ \nBran VI\n↓\nCatelyn VII\nSynopsis\nCatelyn\n reflects on how she has always done her duty, remembering that she never comforted \nLittlefinger\n after\nBrandon\n had injured him, nor did she bid him farewell when \nher father\n sent him off. Later, Maester \nVyman\n shows\nher a letter from Lord \nElwood Meadows\n, the new castellan at \nStorm's End\n. The man does not make note of \nEdric\nStorm\n, and she wonders again why \nStannis\n is so interested in the boy, thinking he might mean to use the boy’s\nappearance as proof of \nJoffrey\n’s ill heritage. Catelyn is considering the nature of bastards and their fathers, and\nrecalls \nRoose Bolton\n’s recent missive where he calls his bastard, \nRamsay Snow\n, a boy of tainted blood and that he\ncounts himself \"well rid of him\". Bolton states that he hopes \nRobb\n will weigh his capture of \nHarrenhal\n against the\ncrimes of his bastard son.\nCatelyn is drawn away as fighting begins across the \nRed Fork\n, yet each time Lord \nTywin\n’s troops attempt to cross,\nEdmure\n’s men repel them, raining arrows down upon them as they attempt to ford the river. Catelyn is unimpressed\ndespite the victory her brother has won against one of the most famous battlefield commanders alive. She sends\nwine to \nCleos Frey\n, and then attempts to gain information from him, but the man knows little of use. All she learns\nis that Ser Cleos saw only \nSansa\n at court, and she looked drawn; Catelyn muses that either Cersei is keeping \nArya\nhidden for fear of what she might say or do, or her younger daughter is dead. Catelyn does consider \nTyrion\n a man\nwho might be trusted at his word, despite what has transpired between the two of them. She then learns the results of\nthe great victory, that \nLeo Lefford\n has drowned, \nGregor Clegane\n was badly wounded, and the great knight\nStrongboar\n taken captive. Yet despite the fact that they were winning, she is still afraid.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn V\n↑\nTyrion X\n ←\nCatelyn VI\n→ \nBran VI\n↓\nCatelyn VII\n\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 46: Bran VI\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran V\n↑\nCatelyn VI\n ←\nBran VI\n→ \nArya IX\n↓\nBran VII\nSynopsis\nBran\n is once again dreaming through the eyes of \nSummer\n, who is alerted by a faint clink, and he and \nhis brother\n can\nsmell something wrong in the air. The direwolf desperately tries to escape from the godswood, but the gate is\nlocked, so tries to climb a tree to reach the wall, following Bran’s thoughts. Summer falls from the tree, and Bran\nawakes with a sore shoulder to find a strange man in his room, followed by \nTheon Greyjoy\n. Theon, calling himself a\nprince, tells him that the castle is his now, that his \nironmen\n swam the moat and unlocked the postern gate. His\nfather’s former ward informs him that he must make the people of \nWinterfell\n aware that Theon is in command, and\nthat no one will be hurt if they concede. Bran watches as all those whom \nJojen\n saw in his dream die, and all of the\ncrannogman’s words have come true. \nThe sea has come to Winterfell\n, and Mikken drowns\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_206df308064a6fa458ce55ac04555906a4977c3a0faddbd2396c4084567cb90f_v2"}
