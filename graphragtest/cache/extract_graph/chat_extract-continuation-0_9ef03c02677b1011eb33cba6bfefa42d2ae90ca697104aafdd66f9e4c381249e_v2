The Hound offers to go kill it, which\nJoffrey finds amusing, believing the \nStarks\n would not notice it missing. Tyrion notes that the Starks can count past\nsix, unlike some princes.\nThe Hound uses the remark as an excuse to make fun of Tyrion's height. Tyrion brushes the comment off before\nadvising Joffrey to pay a visit to the Starks to offer his sympathies. When Joffrey asks what good it would do,\nTyrion tells him that his absence has been noticed. Joffrey continues to refuse, but Tyrion proceeds to browbeat him\nto the edge of tears until the boy acquiesces. The Hound, looming over Tyrion, warns him that the prince will\nremember how his uncle slapped him. Tyrion responds that he hopes he does and that the Hound should be a good\ndog and remind Joffrey if he forgets it.\nTyrion then seeks out his \nbrother\n and \nsister\n, who are having breakfast in the morning room of the guest house. He\nasks if \nKing Robert\n is still in bed and Cersei disdainfully explains that Robert has been up all night with Lord\nEddard\n and has taken the Starks' sorrow deeply to heart. When Jaime adds that Robert has a big heart, Tyrion\nremembers that during his childhood Jaime was the only person who ever showed him any affection or respect. In\nreturn, Tyrion is willing to forgive Jaime almost anything.\nAs Tyrion orders breakfast, \nPrince Tommen\n asks after Bran and says he doesn't want him to die. Jaime comments on\nthe name \"Brandon\" being \nunlucky\n, but Tyrion states this may not be the case, explaining that \nMaester Luwin\n thinks\nthat Bran may recover. As he speaks, Tyrion catches the significant glance between Jaime and Cersei. Cersei\nimmediately insists it is no mercy for Bran to live. When \nMyrcella\n asks if Bran will be alright, Tyrion replies that\nBran will never walk again. Tyrion goes on to say that the \nwolf\n howling outside his window may be contributing to\nBran's survival: when the window is closed Bran gets weaker, but his heart strengthens again when it is open. Cersei\nresponds that the wolves disturb her and are dangerous, but Jaime tells her the girls' wolves will doubtless follow\nthem to \nKing's Landing\n.\nTyrion then reveals to his family that he intends to visit \nthe Wall\n before returning south. Jaime jokes that he hopes\nTyrion is not planning to \ntake the black\n, but Tyrion quips back that if he did the whores would go begging. Cersei\nleaves abruptly with her children, insisting they shouldn't hear such filth, while Jaime wonders if Eddard will leave\nWinterfell\n with Bran so ill. Tyrion insists that King Robert will make the choice for Eddard.\nJaime declares that if he were Eddard, he would end Bran's torment and save him from being a cripple. Tyrion,\nhimself less than able-bodied, advises Jaime not to say as much to Eddard before wondering out loud what tale Bran\nmight tell if he wakes up. Jaime is not amused and wonders aloud about Tyrion's loyalty. Tyrion replies that Jaime\nknows how much he loves his family.\nNavigation:\n\nBran II\n ←\nTyrion I\n→ \nJon II\n↓\nTyrion II\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 10: Jon II\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nJon I\n↑\nTyrion I\n ←\nJon II\n→ \nDaenerys II\n↓\nJon III\nJon\n says his last goodbyes, first to the comatose \nBran\n, then to \nRobb\n, and finally to \nArya\n, to whom he gives a\nBraavosi\n-type \nsword\n.\nSynopsis\nJon\n climbs the stairs to \nBran\n's room with \nGhost\n beside him, fearing that it might be the last time. \nCatelyn\n is there,\nhaving never left Bran's side for close to a fortnight, which has kept Jon away, but now there is no more time. When\nJon enters, Catelyn responds with hostility, asking why he is here and demanding he leave. While once this would\nhave sent him crying, now it only makes Jon angry so that when Catelyn threatens to call the guards, he calls her\nbluff.\nJon finds Bran emaciated and shrunken, and the covers over his legs look wrong. Jon asks Bran not to die and tells\nhim everyone is waiting for him to wake up. Jon remembers how much Bran was looking forward to the journey\nsouth while explaining that he is going north to \nthe Wall\n with Uncle \nBenjen\n. Catelyn admits that she was wishing for\nBran to stay home with her, and her wish seems to have been granted. When Jon attempts to reassure her, she lashes\nout at him and, as he is leaving, tells him that it should have been him that fell.\nJon makes the long walk to the yard, where things are in an uproar as the party prepares to leave. \nRobb\n brings news\nthat Benjen is looking for Jon. When Robb asks about his mother, Jon tells him she was kind.
