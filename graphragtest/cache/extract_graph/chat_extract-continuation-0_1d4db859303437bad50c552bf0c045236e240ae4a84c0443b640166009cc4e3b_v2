Twice they evade and once drive\noff \nlongships\n of the \nironmen\n, before they reach their destination and undergo customs inspections. The ironborn now\ncontrol many of the outlying towns and fortifications surrounding the \nArbor\n and along the \nMander\n nearly to\nOldtown, having sacked \nRyamsport\n and taken \nVinetown\n and \nStarfish Harbor\n. They have also been raiding ships in\nthe area. \nSam\n learns that even Oldtown is at risk until Lord \nPaxter Redwyne\n can bring his fleet back from\nDragonstone\n. Meanwhile, Lord \nLeyton Hightower\n has not left his tower in years, while his sons struggle to protect\nthe great city. His youngest son, Ser \nHumfrey\n, has sailed to the \nFree Cities\n to hire sellsails or persuade his half-sister\nLynesse\n to loan him some of the Archon of Lys' ships. As Sam prepares to disembark for the \nCitadel\n, he considers\nwhether it will be safe for \nGilly\n at \nHorn Hill\n, since it will only have a small regiment of guards left. Fortunately,\nSam knows that Gilly will be safe aboard the \nCinnamon Wind\n, at least until he can learn more of the situation in\nOldtown.\nUpon reaching the \nSeneschal's Court\n, Sam is forced to wait a long while before he will be admitted to speak with the\nSeneschal\n. His patience running thin at the delay, Sam is approached by \nAlleras\n, who informs him that it will take a\npenny to get past the acolyte. But when Alleras introduces himself, Sam is taken aback when he learns that the boy\nis called \"the Sphinx\". Samwell then tells Alleras the story of how he reached Oldtown, leaving out only the secrets\nhe has sworn to keep. After hearing all that has transpired, especially Maester \nAemon\n's plea that the Citadel learn of\nDaenerys\n, Alleras tells him to forget the Seneschal. The archmaesters will believe little of what Sam has to say, but\nthere is one who will: Archmaester \nMarwyn\n. At the \nIsle of Ravens\n, Sam recognizes \nLeo Tyrell\n, but before many\nwords can be exchanged, Marwyn the Mage appears and ushers Sam and Alleras into his chambers.\nMarwyn first describes how the \nValyrians\n used \ndragonglass\n for various magical means, noticing Sam's interest in the\nObsidian candle\n. Sam then repeats what he told Alleras, stating that Maester Aemon was convinced that Daenerys\nwas the promised one in the prophecy, not Prince \nRhaegar\n or \nStannis\n. To this, Archmaester Marwyn reveals how\nfickle and treacherous prophecy can be, but he is still intrigued. He makes it clear to Sam that Maester Aemon may\nhave been killed by the archmaesters had he spoken his mind to them. When Sam inquires why, Marwyn replies,\n\"Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? The world the Citadel is building has no place in it\nfor sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to\nwaste his life upon the \nWall\n, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He\ncould not be trusted. No more than I can.\"\nCommanding Alleras to look after Sam, Marwyn makes known his plan to travel to \nSlaver's Bay\n, as Maester Aemon\nhad intended. He intends to take the \nCinnamon Wind\n, hoping to reach Daenerys prior to the \"grey sheep\", as he calls\nthe other archmaesters. He advises Sam to work rapidly toward his chain, and to never mention anything of\nprophecies, dragons, or Daenerys to anyone in the Citadel. Marwyn quickly departs, and Alleras reveals to Sam that\ntheir meeting was not happenstance. The Mage knew Sam was coming, supposedly from the dragonglass candle.\nThe \nnovice\n in the room the whole time shows Sam to his quarters, finally divulging his name, \"I'm \nPate\n, like the pig\nboy.\"\nNavigation:\nSamwell IV\n↑\n\nJaime VII\n ←\nSamwell V\n\nA Dance with Dragons - Prologue\nPlace(s): \nBeyond the Wall, in the \nhaunted forest\n \n \nNavigation:\nPrologue\n→ \nTyrion I\nThe \nskinchanger\n \nVaramyr\n, who has been injured during his flight from the \nbattle beneath the Wall\n, is plotting to take\nover another body as he is dying.\nSynopsis\nThe chapter begins from the perspective of a \nskinchanger\n in the body of a wolf.
