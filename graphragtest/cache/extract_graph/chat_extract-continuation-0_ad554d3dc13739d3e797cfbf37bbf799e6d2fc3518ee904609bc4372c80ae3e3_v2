With him on the pulpit are the \nHigh\nSepton\n, King \nJoffrey\n, Queen \nCersei\n, \nthe Hound\n, four other members of the \nKingsguard\n, \nVarys\n, \nLittlefinger\n, and\nSansa\n; Arya wonders why Sansa is there and why she looks so happy.\nThen her father makes a speech in which he confesses that he betrayed the trust of King Robert. A stone from the\ncrowd strikes him, causing a gash on his face and more stones follow. The High Septon intones that Blessed Baelor\ntaught mercy along with justice and asks Joffrey for his verdict. Joffrey declares that his mother and his betrothed\nhave requested that Lord Eddard be allowed to \ntake the black\n. Then he declares that while he is king treason shall\nnever go unpunished, and calls for Ser \nIlyn Payne\n to bring him Eddard’s head. This causes an uproar around Joffrey\nas the High Septon, Cersei, and even Varys protest the decree.\nArya jumps to the ground, drawing Needle, but the crowd quickly engulfs her. She sees Ser Ilyn raise \nIce\n—he has\nIce!—and hears Sansa screaming. She continues to fight toward them, using Needle to cut a path. A hand shoots out\nto grab her and hold her tight, forcing her to drop her sword. The smelly old man who has grabbed her tells her not\nto look and calls her a boy. Then she hears a soft sighing noise.\nArya looks at the smelly man and recognizes him as \nYoren\n of the Night’s Watch, who talked with her father. He\ntells her to keep her mouth shut and that she is coming with him. Yoren shakes her hard when she tries to speak.\nOnce the crowd starts to disperse, he hands her back Needle, saying that he hopes she can use it. He keeps calling\nher a boy and does not give her the opportunity to deny it, insisting that she is trying to say she is not a smart boy.\nYoren shoves her inside a doorway and a blade flashes at Arya’s face; she wrenches back her head but cannot\nescape because Yoren has a strong grip on her hair.\nNavigation:\nArya IV\n↑\nDaenerys VIII\n ←\nArya V\n→ \nBran VII\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nArya I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 66: Bran VII\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nBran VII\n↑\nArya V\n ←\nBran VII\n→ \nSansa VI\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nBran I\nBran\n and \nRickon\n have the same dream about seeing \ntheir father\n in the \ncrypt of Winterfell\n. \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n takes Bran\ndown to the crypts to show him his father is not there. They find Rickon already there. They go back to the\nmaester’s turret where Luwin tells them about the coming of the \nFirst Men\n, the treaty with the \nchildren of the forest\nand the coming of the \nAndals\n. A raven arrives with news of Lord Eddard’s death.\nSynopsis\nBran\n is watching Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n train the new young recruits in the yard of \nWinterfell\n. \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n is taking\nmeasurements of the comet through his lens tube. Bran comments that the recruits do not fight very well, and is told\nthat Lord \nEddard\n took the cream of the guard with him to \nKing's Landing\n and then \nRobb\n took the rest along with all\nthe likely men for leagues around; men are needed to walk the walls of \nWinterfell\n. Bran stares resentfully at the boys\nbelow, remembering how he knocked Prince \nTommen\n down many times. Then Bran suggests that he could fight\nfrom \nHodor\n’s back, but Luwin dismisses the idea as impractical. Bran talks about the blind knight \nSymeon Star-\nEyes\n, but Luwin insists that that is only a story and that Bran must put his dreams aside.\nThe mention of dreams reminds Bran of his new dream of the \nthree-eyed crow\n, a dream that was very sad. He tells\nLuwin how the crow brought him down to the crypts and his father was there. His father was sad because of \nJon\n.\nWhen he woke up, Bran wanted to go down to the crypts to see if his father was there, but \nHodor\n would not take\nhim. Luwin tells Bran that Eddard will be down there someday, but not be for many years. Bran insists the dream\nwas real and that his father was there. In order to dispel the boy’s delusion, Maester Luwin calls for \nOsha\n, who tells\nthem that she has lived \nbeyond the Wall\n, so a hole in the ground will not scare her. Because of Osha’s good\nbehavior, her chains have been removed, but the shackles remain to show she is not totally trusted. She carries Bran\nin her arms, but he does not mind.\nThe vault seems very dark and gloomy. Summer and Osha seem uncomfortable. When Bran states that the men\nrepresented by the granite statues were the \nKings of Winter\n, Osha tells him that winter has no king; if he had seen a\nwinter he
