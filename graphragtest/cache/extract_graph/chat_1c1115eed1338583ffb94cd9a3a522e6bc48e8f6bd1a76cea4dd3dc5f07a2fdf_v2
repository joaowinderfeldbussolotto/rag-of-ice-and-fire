She is accompanied by Ser \nBrynden Tully\n and Ser \nWylis\n and Ser \nWendel\n \nManderly\n with their\n1,500 men, including 20 knights and 200 mounted men. Their father, Lord \nWyman Manderly\n—who is too fat to sit a\nhorse—has remained to see to the defenses of \nWhite Harbor\n but sent his two stout sons, who would have been the\nfattest men Catelyn had ever seen if she had not met their father.\nSer Brynden, upon seeing the fortress, thinks it is a deathtrap. Most of the ancient fortress has long since rotted away\nleaving only 3 out of 20 towers. Catelyn reassures him that, according to \nher husband\n, it is more formidable than it\nseems. The \nthree\n \nremaining\n \ntowers\n command the only causeway across the impenetrable bogs of the Neck; to\nassault any one of the towers an enemy must wade through waist-deep muck and \nlizard-lion\n-infested moats then\nclimb the moss-covered towers while exposed to attack from the other two towers. In addition, there are also\nsupposed to be cold, vengeful ghosts of \nthe North\n that hunger for southron blood. Ser Brynden jests that he, as a\nsouthron, should not linger in this place.\nCatelyn heads for the \nGatehouse Tower\n, understanding the lone \nStark\n banner to mean that \nRobb\n has made his seat\nthere. She arrives to find Robb surrounded by his father’s bannermen in a drafty hall. At first, Robb does not notice\nCatelyn, but his \nwolf\n does. After his bannermen fall quiet, her son looks up and is happy to see her. Each of the lords\npay their respects to her, \nTheon Greyjoy\n being the last. He expresses surprise at Catelyn’s presence, so she explains\nthat she learned Robb had called the banners when she came ashore at White Harbor. She then introduces the\nManderly brothers and her uncle.\nWhen Robb asks, Catelyn explains that she has sent Ser \nRodrik\n back to \nWinterfell\n to act as \ncastellan\n and to assist\nMaester\n \nLuwin\n in military matters. After some of the lords give Catelyn reassurance that Winterfell is safe, Lord\nRoose Bolton\n states that it is rumored she holds \nTyrion Lannister\n, who would be a good hostage. Catelyn admits she\nlost the dwarf because the gods saw fit to free him with help from \nher sister\n. Speaking of Lysa, Catelyn recalls that\nbefore leaving the \nEyrie\n, she attempted to convince her sister to let her take \nRobert Arryn\n as a fosterling, but Lysa’s\nrage had been frightening.\nCatelyn then sends the bannermen and Theon away to speak to Robb alone. Once they are gone, Catelyn notes that\nher son looks older, especially with his new beard. Catelyn, who is afraid for her son, notes to Robb that he is only\nfifteen and leading a host to war. Robb insists that there was no one else. Catelyn argues that he could have given\ncommand to any of the bannermen, or even Theon, although he would not have been her choice. Robb responds that\nnone of them are Starks. Catelyn then reminds Robb that he was fighting with wooden swords less than a year ago.\nRobb’s eyes flare with anger, but he softens and asks if she is sending him back to Winterfell. Catelyn explains that\nshe cannot do such a thing; if she did, the bannermen would lose respect for him, which would hurt him when he\n\nbecomes Lord of Winterfell one day. Robb’s relief is obvious.\nRobb asks if Catelyn knows about Lord Eddard's capture and she says she does; \nRobert\n's sudden death and Eddard’s\nfall scared her greatly. Catelyn asks about the girls and Robb tells her that letters addressed to each of them from\nSansa\n arrived at Winterfell. Robb returns with a crumpled parchment and hands it to her. She reads it with concern\ngiving way to disbelief, then to anger, and then to fear. She exclaims that it is \nCersei’s\n letter, and that they have\nSansa hostage and mean to keep her. Robb points out that there is no mention of \nArya\n and that he was hoping that\nCatelyn still held Tyrion to exchange for his sisters.\nRobb then asks about the knights of \nthe Vale\n and is told that Lysa will do nothing; only one knight of the Vale will\nride to war: the best, Ser Brynden Tully. Robb asks Catelyn what they are going to do with the 18,000 men he does\nhave. Catelyn can tell that Robb is caught in indecision, which will not do. Knowing he is worried about his father\nand sisters, Catelyn explains to her son that if he goes to \nKing's Landing\n to bend the knee he will never be allowed\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1c1115eed1338583ffb94cd9a3a522e6bc48e8f6bd1a76cea4dd3dc5f07a2fdf_v2"}
