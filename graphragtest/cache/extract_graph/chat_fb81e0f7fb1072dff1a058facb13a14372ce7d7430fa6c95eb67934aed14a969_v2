The\nHound is to be judged by \nBeric Dondarrion\n and hanged if found guilty. Thoros is a changed man, no longer a fat\npriest with a fake flaming sword, saying, \"I am not the false priest you knew. The \nLord of Light\n has woken in my\nsoul. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land.\"\nWhen Dondarrion appears, Arya is appalled by his appearance. Once handsome, the man is now stick thin, missing\nan eye, with part of his skull crushed in, a noose scar around his neck, and a terrible wound through his chest.\nDondarrion asks for charges to be made against Sandor, but the Hound spits at the accusations, laying them at the\nfeet of his brother and others. But Arya accuses him of killing \nMycah\n, and the Hound does not refute that. The\nLightning Lord sentences him to trial by battle, and it will be Dondarrion he faces. Before the fight, Thoros says a\nprayer to \nR'hllor\n, and then Dondarrion cuts open his palm with his sword, causing the blade to take fire.\nThe fight ends with Clegane’s shield destroyed and his left arm in flames, but the Hound cuts Dondarrion from\nshoulder to breastbone. Sandor is screaming in pain and fear from the hideous burn to his arm. When Arya confronts\nhim about Mycah, Clegane admits killing the boy, and suddenly Dondarrion appears, alive and leaning against\nThoros, to tell Sandor he has gone to hell.\nNavigation:\nArya V\n↑\nSamwell II\n ←\nArya VI\n→ \nCatelyn IV\n↓\nArya VII\n\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 35: Catelyn IV\nPlace(s): \nRiverrun\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n↑\nArya VI\n ←\nCatelyn IV\n→ \nDavos IV\n↓\nCatelyn V\nSynopsis\nHoster Tully\n has finally passed away, and his family and bannermen are gathered for the funeral. \nLame Lothar Frey\nand \nWalder Rivers\n have come to \nRiverrun\n to negotiate a meeting between \nRobb\n and Lord \nWalder Frey\n that will\nhopefully restore the alliance. The Lord of Riverrun is placed on a funeral pyre boat launched by Robb, \nTytos\nBlackwood\n, \nJonos Bracken\n, \nJason Mallister\n, \nMarq Piper\n, \nKaryl Vance\n and Lothar Frey. Lothar is invited to take the\nplace that would be \nDesmond Grell\n's as a gesture of goodwill towards House Frey, as an effort from Robb to\napologize for his failure to keep his vow of marrying a Frey. \nEdmure\n tries to launch a fire arrow at the ship to light it\nbut he misses three times. He gives the bow to \nBrynden Tully\n, who hits the boat, causing it to catch fire.\nLater, Robb is devastated by the news from \nDuskendale\n, shocked that \nRobett Glover\n and \nHelman Tallhart\n took it\nupon themselves to attack such an insignificant castle, losing nearly a third of Robb’s infantry; he later states his\nintention to exchange Robett for their captive \nMartyn Lannister\n.
