When night falls,\nDrogo takes Daenerys for a long ride before making love.\nSynopsis\nWhile waiting for \nDaenerys\n' wedding, \nIllyrio Mopatis\n explains that \nDrogo\n's \nkhalasar\n of 40,000 \nDothraki\n warriors\nand their families and herds gathered outside the walls of \nPentos\n have made the other \nmagisters\n so uneasy that they\nhave doubled the city guard. The Dothraki are eating everything in sight, and Illyrio thinks it would be best to have\nthe marriage as soon as possible. Ser \nJorah Mormont\n has offered and been accepted into the service of Daenerys'\nbrother \nViserys\n. Viserys is impatient for \nDrogo\n to help him regain his throne. Illyrio explains to him that the \nKhal\nmust take his new bride to \nVaes Dothrak\n first, and then wait until the omens are favorable for war. Viserys\ncomplains at the delay despite Illyrio and Jorah cautioning patience.\nThat night, Daenerys dreams of Viserys chasing and beating her and saying, \"You woke the dragon.\" Then she turns\nto see a dragon in his place and wakes shaking with a fine sheen of sweat on her skin.\nDaenerys weds Khal Drogo under the open sky, before forty thousand Dothraki warriors. The ceremonies begin at\ndawn and continue until dusk. Viserys, Illyrio, and Jorah are seated below Drogo and Daenerys at the feast, which\ngrates on Viserys' pride, especially when food is first served to Daenerys and Drogo before being offered to him.\nDaenerys, with the forced smile her brother told her she should wear, eats little since her stomach is upset. She is\nseated only with her new husband, and they do not even share a common language, so there is nothing for her to do.\nEarly on in the day she sees Dothraki men taking dancing women and mounting them in the open like animals.\nWhen two men grab the same woman, a fight to the death ensues. The survivor then takes another woman. Illyrio\nhas told her that a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered dull; by the end of the day a dozen\nmen have died, obviously making it an exceptional wedding. Daenerys is consumed by fear of her hulking husband\nwith a stern cruel face and a culture that is so different, and of her brother if she should fail him.\nAs the sun sets, Daenerys receives her bride gifts. Viserys gives her three hand maids that cost him nothing, picked\nto teach her what she needs to know: \nIrri\n (to teach her how to ride), \nJhiqui\n (to teach her the Dothraki tongue) and\nDoreah\n (to teach her the arts of love). Ser Jorah, with an apology since it was all he could afford, gives her a stack of\nold books in the \nCommon Tongue\n, and she thanks him with all her heart. Illyrio gives her fine silks and fabrics, and\nthree huge \ndragon\n's eggs: one is green, one is cream-colored, and one is black with scarlet ripples and swirls. Illyrio\ntells her that they have turned to stone over the years. Khal Drogo's \nbloodriders\n give her the traditional three\nweapons, which she refuses with the traditional refusals and passes to her husband.
