While they wait, \nLommy\n and \nTarber\n go wading and throw mud at \nHot Pie\n while Arya\nwatches \nKurz\n catch a fish with his hands, thinking it must be easier than catching cats.\nThe scouts return at midday to report only a burnt bridge. Drawing a map in the mud, Yoren explains that the river\nflows south from the \nGods Eye\n. With no way to cross the river without abandoning the wagons, they cannot pass\nalong the lake's western shore as planned, and going east will bring them back to the \nkingsroad\n. Yoren decides to go\nnorth to where the river meets the lake, sell all they have to hire a boat in \nthe town\n there, and sail across the lake to\nHarrentown\n. There they can buy new mounts or take refuge at \nHarrenhal\n, the seat of Lady \nShella Whent\n, a known\nfriend of the \nNight's Watch\n.\nHot Pie worries about ghosts at Harrenhal, but Yoren only spits. Arya recalls \nOld Nan\n's stories about Evil King\nHarren\n and how \nAegon\n unleashed his \ndragons\n to turn the castle into a pyre. Old Nan told that fiery spirits still haunt\nthe castle and sometimes men who sleep there are found burnt alive in the morning, but Arya does not believe the\nstories. It will be knights at Harrenhal, not ghosts, and she can reveal herself to Lady Whent and maybe be escorted\nhome.\nThey pass abandoned cottages and untended fields to find the town deserted as well, which frightens Arya when she\nwonders what scared the people away. Growing apprehensive, Yoren leaves ten recruits to guard the wagons and\nsplits the rest up to search the town while he investigates the towerhouse. \nWoth\n once pulled an oar on a galley, so\nYoren orders him to take Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy to search for boats.\nThe docks are empty except for a rotten rowboat, and Arya realizes the people took all the boats when they fled.\nLommy and Hot Pie suggest they search a nearby inn for food and ale, but Woth insists on sticking to Yoren's\norders. Despondent, Arya washes her face in the lake and wonders if she could swim all the way to \nWinterfell\n. Woth\nshouts at her to help search, so she does, but they only find some sails and nails.\nIt is dark when Yoren returns to report the towerhouse empty. He dismisses suggestions of patching the rowboat or\nbuilding a new one, but he is intrigued by Gendry's idea of a raft. However, a raft would mean leaving the wagons\nand staying close to shore, so Yoren decides to sleep on it. Lommy asks if they can stay at the inn, but Yoren\nchooses the holdfast for its protective wall. Arya argues they should not stay at all since even the lord ran away.\nLommy mocks her as scared, but Yoren declares her reasoning smart, except the Night's Watch takes no part and\nnobody is their enemy. Arya thinks that nobody is their friend either, but she remains silent to avoid seeming craven.\n\nThe holdfast is surrounded by a ten-foot wall of rough-cut stone with iron bars to brace the front gate. Besides the\nmain gate, there is a postern to the north and a narrow tunnel that leads to the lakeshore hidden under the barn.\nYoren has them park a wagon on the trap door to make sure nobody enters that way. He also assigns three watches\nand sends Tarber, Kurz, and \nCutjack\n to keep watch from the towerhouse, telling Kurz to use his hunting horn if\ndanger threatens. They drive their wagons and animals inside and bar the main gate. Dobber, Gendry, and Arya\ndraw cook duty and Arya is set to pluck the goose and two chickens Koss brings in, while Gendry splits wood and\nYoren sharpens his dirk. Everyone is quiet during the meal, even Lommy.\nArya draws second watch, but when sleep proves difficult she borrows Yoren's whetstone and hones \nNeedle\n instead.\nHot Pie asks where she got such a good sword, more politely than \nbefore\n and she admits \nher brother\n gave it to her.\nHot Pie is surprised, as Arya has never mentioned any brothers. Arya replies that she has lots of brothers, but when\nHot Pie asks whether they are older or younger than her, she lies that they are all older, with longswords, and they\ntaught her how to kill people who bother her. Hot Pie insists he was just talking, but then leaves her alone. Curling\nup on her pallet, Arya is annoyed by the \ncrying girl\n, who is crying as usual.\nArya dreams of a wolf howling and wakes at once. Pulling on her boots, she asks if anyone else heard anything.\nLommy mocks her for having wolves in her head, and Woth and \nGerren\n assure her the wolves are safely outside.\nArya insists there was a wolf, and before the others can shout her down they hear Kurz' hunting horn. In a heartbeat,\neveryone is dressing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YOREN<|>PERSON<|>Yoren is a leader who sends others to search for valuables and makes decisions for the group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOBBER<|>PERSON<|>Dobber is sent by Yoren to search the body for valuables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSS<|>PERSON<|>Koss is taken upriver by Yoren)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOTH<|>PERSON<|>Woth is sent downriver to look for a ford and later assigned to search for boats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERREN<|>PERSON<|>Gerren is sent downriver to look for a ford and later helps search the town)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOMMY<|>PERSON<|>Lommy goes wading and throws mud at Hot Pie, later suggests searching an inn for food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARBER<|>PERSON<|>Tarber goes wading with Lommy and is later assigned to keep watch from the towerhouse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT PIE<|>PERSON<|>Hot Pie is teased by Lommy and Tarber, worries about ghosts at Harrenhal, and asks Arya about her sword)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARYA<|>PERSON<|>Arya watches Kurz catch a fish, recalls stories about Harrenhal, and is set to pluck a goose)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KURZ<|>PERSON<|>Kurz catches a fish with his hands and is later assigned to keep watch from the towerhouse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GODS EYE<|>GEO<|>Gods Eye is a lake from which the river flows south)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGSROAD<|>GEO<|>Kingsroad is a route that the group wants to avoid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRENTOWN<|>GEO<|>Harrentown is a destination where the group plans to buy new mounts or take refuge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRENHAL<|>GEO<|>Harrenhal is the seat of Lady Shella Whent and a place where the group might take refuge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHELLA WHENT<|>PERSON<|>Lady Shella Whent is a friend of the Night's Watch and the ruler of Harrenhal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD NAN<|>PERSON<|>Old Nan is a storyteller who told Arya tales about Harrenhal and its ghosts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARREN<|>PERSON<|>Evil King Harren is a historical figure associated with Harrenhal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AEGON<|>PERSON<|>Aegon is a historical figure who unleashed dragons on Harrenhal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENDRY<|>PERSON<|>Gendry is assigned to search for boats and later helps with cook duty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUTJACK<|>PERSON<|>Cutjack is assigned to keep watch from the towerhouse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEEDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Needle is a sword owned by Arya)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTERFELL<|>GEO<|>Winterfell is Arya's home that she dreams of swimming to)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Night's Watch is an organization that Yoren is associated with and takes no part in conflicts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRYING GIRL<|>PERSON<|>The crying girl is a person who is crying as usual, annoying Arya)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>DOBBER<|>Yoren sends Dobber to search the body for valuables<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>KOSS<|>Yoren takes Koss upriver<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>WOTH<|>Yoren sends Woth downriver to look for a ford<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>GERREN<|>Yoren sends Gerren downriver to look for a ford<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOMMY<|>HOT PIE<|>Lommy throws mud at Hot Pie<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>KURZ<|>Arya watches Kurz catch a fish<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>GODS EYE<|>Yoren explains that the river flows south from the Gods Eye<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>HARRENHAL<|>Yoren plans to take refuge at Harrenhal<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHELLA WHENT<|>NIGHT'S WATCH<|>Lady Shella Whent is a friend of the Night's Watch<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OLD NAN<|>ARYA<|>Old Nan told stories to Arya about Harrenhal<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AEGON<|>HARREN<|>Aegon unleashed dragons to defeat Evil King Harren<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>NEEDLE<|>Arya owns and sharpens the sword Needle<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>HOT PIE<|>Hot Pie asks Arya about her sword<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>WINTERFELL<|>Arya dreams of swimming to Winterfell<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOREN<|>WOTH<|>Yoren orders Woth to take Arya and others to search for boats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>GENDRY<|>Arya and Gendry are assigned cook duty together<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARYA<|>CUTJACK<|>Arya and Cutjack are part of the same group under Yoren's leadership<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
