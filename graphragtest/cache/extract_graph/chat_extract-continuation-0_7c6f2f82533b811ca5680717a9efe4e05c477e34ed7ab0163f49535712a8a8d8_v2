It seems that neither the Old nor the \nNew Gods\n are listening to prayer,\nTyrion thinks, wondering whether this should give him some comfort. He makes a glib comment about the kings\nfalling like leaves this autumn and their little war winning itself, prompting a poisonly sweet reply by Cersei that it's\nin fact Lord Tywin who won the war. Lord Tywin doesn't consider the war over as long as enemies are in the field,\n\nyet Cersei is optimistic that the lords of the \nRiverlands\n, confronted with the combined powers of \nHighgarden\n,\nCasterly Rock\n and \nDorne\n without the northmen to support them, will choose submission over destruction now. Lord\nTywin agrees that most will, except for \nRiverrun\n and probably \nSeagard\n and \nRaventree Hall\n. However, \nBrynden\nTully\n won't dare to become a threat as long as Lord Frey keeps his nephew Edmure as hostage, and the \nFreys\n can\nkeep \nJason Mallister\n penned up at his seat while \nJonos Bracken\n might be bribed to change allegiance and attack the\nBlackwoods\n. In the end, everyone will bend their knees, Tywin predicts, and he is ready to offer generous terms. He\nis going to spare every castle except one. Tyrion assumes that the exception will be \nHarrenhal\n, which Lord Tywin\nconfirms, announcing that he has already commanded Ser \nGregor Clegane\n to attack the castle and rid the realm of\nthe \nBrave Companions\n. Tyrion is amused about his father exploiting the Mountain before he will be handed over to\nthe \nMartells\n, yet the prospect of Littlefinger soon being able to take his seat at Harrenhal doesn't please him. He\nwonders whether Lord Baelish has already arrived at the \nVale\n, wishing his ship sank instead.\nKing Joffrey doesn't agree with generous terms, insisting that all traitors should be executed instead. He wants Lord\nWalder to send him Robb Stark's head, so that he can serve it to Sansa at his wedding feast. Ser Kevan is shocked\nand reminds him that Sansa is now his aunt by marriage. Cersei tries to dismiss his statement, calling it a jest, yet\nJoffrey insists. Tyrion angrily tells Joffrey that he can't torture Sansa any longer, calling him a monster, to which\nJoffrey replies that Tyrion is the true monster. Tyrion counters that Joffrey should be concerned then, as monsters\nare dangerous and kings are dying like flies already. Joffrey and Cersei are furious about Tyrion's threat, but Lord\nTywin scolds Joffrey instead, advising him that a king who feels the need to remind people of his power is no true\nking. \nKing Aerys\n never understood that, Lord Tywin says, as proven by his habit of having the tongues of people\nlike Ser \nIlyn Payne\n ripped out, but Joffrey will. It's necessary to fight your enemies, but if they yield, generosity is\nthe right approach. Lord Tywin closes by telling Joffrey that the only head he should be concerned with right now is\nMargaery Tyrell\n's maidenhead.\nJoffrey is sullen, then surprises everyone in the room by defying Lord Tywin, accusing him of having been afraid of\nKing Aerys. Tyrion thinks that things just got interesting. Cersei demands that Joffrey apologize to his grandfather,\nyet he goes on, recounting how it was \nRobert Baratheon\n who fought \nPrince Rhaegar\n and won the crown while Lord\nTywin hid at Casterly Rock. A strong king acts boldly, he states. Lord Tywin is not amused, thanking the King\ncoldly for sharing his wisdom. He asks Ser Kevan to escort Joffrey to his bedchamber and Pycelle to give him some\ndreamwine, completely ignoring Joffrey's protest. As Ser Kevan firmly guides Joffrey out and Pycelle follows,\nTyrion and Cersei remain, on their father's order. Cersei tries to apologize for Joffrey's behavior, calling him willful.\nLord Tywin thinks Joffrey is more stupid than willful and asks who put the idea into the boy's head that strong kings\nact boldly. Cersei suggests it was Robert. Tyrion, glad to bring up that comment again, confirms that the part about\nTywin hiding in Casterly Rock sounded like something Robert would say. Cersei tries to play into this, but Lord\nTywin is upset that he might have fought a war to seat \"Robert the Second\" on the \nIron Throne\n when Cersei has\nbeen assuring him that the boy cared nothing for his father. He doesn't, Cersei insists, recounting how Robert cared\nnothing for his son, would have beaten the boy if he could and hit him so hard once that Joffrey lost two teeth,\ncausing her to threaten Robert to kill him if he hit him again. Lord Tywin tells his daughter to leave, which she does\nseethingly. Tyrion proposes that, rather than following his father's footsteps, Joffrey will become \"\nAerys\n the Third\".\nLord Tywin responds that he is only thirteen and still has time to grow, yet Tyrion notices that his father is more\nupset than\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYRION<|>PERSON<|>Tyrion is a character who reflects on
