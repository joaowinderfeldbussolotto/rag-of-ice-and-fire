Uncle Kevan is not your enemy. \nI\n am not your\nenemy.\" However, Cersei throws him out of her solar in fury.\nIn the White Sword Tower, Jaime speaks with \nLoras Tyrell\n, asking him what he knows of certain famous\nkingsguard. Ser Loras is well-versed, but when the Lord Commander mentions some lesser-known Kingsguard, the\nKnight of Flowers does not recognize their names. Jaime points out that all of them served well, perhaps even better\nthan the famous knights. Loras remarks that the great Kingsguard knights will always be remembered as heroes, but\nJaime reminds him that the most infamous will also be remembered. And then there are those who are not easily\nclassified, of which he offers as an example \nCriston Cole\n, the Kingmaker.\nNavigation:\nJaime I\n↑\nSamwell II\n ←\nJaime II\n→ \nCersei IV\n↓\nJaime III\n\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 17: Cersei IV\nPlace(s): \nKing's Landing\n \n \nNavigation:\nCersei III\n↑\nJaime II\n ←\nCersei IV\n→ \nThe Iron Captain\n↓\nCersei V\nSynopsis\nAfter yet another group presents her with a \ndwarf's head\n that is not \nTyrion's\n, \nCersei\n walks together with \nQyburn\n to\nmeet the small council. The new \nMaster of Whisperers\n indicates that he has prepared the \"skull\" in an ebony box for\ndelivery to Prince \nDoran\n, but no mention is made that it belongs to \nGregor Clegane\n.\nPycelle\n is near apoplectic upon hearing that Qyburn has been raised to Lord and has replaced \nVarys\n on the council,\nand Cersei makes it clear how unfit she considers the old Grand Maester. Cersei has finalised her appointments,\nplacing men she considers to be meek and loyal and giving them the titles used in the \nFree Cities\n, thinking that she\nwill have no \"masters\" with her in the \nsmall Council\n. She now has a council consisting of:\nThe council first discusses the unrest in \nSunspear\n and Prince Doran's letter that he imprisoned the \nSand Snakes\n.\nCersei notes that they are sending \nBalon Swann\n to Dorne with \nGregor Clegane\n's head as has been promised, but she\ndoes not mention that Balon will have another task as well.\nWe also learn that \nTyrion's High Septon\n has died in his \"sleep\", and the council brings up the continuing influx of\n\"sparrows\" into \nKing's Landing\n, stirring up the populace with their preaching of \"doom and demon worship\". But\nCersei cares not, nor does she care who becomes \nHigh Septon\n, provided he \"pronounce(s) an anathema upon the\nImp.\"\nThe next topic is a letter by the \nLords Declarant\n in \nthe Vale\n of Arryn, but the Queen Regent decides not to intervene\ndirectly on \nLittlefinger\n's behalf, but only send a letter warning these Lords that no harm must come to Lord Petyr.\nWhen the subject of rebuilding the fleet comes up, Cersei is adamant against making any pact with the \nironborn\n,\nstating, \"Their turn will come, once we have dealt with \nStannis\n.\" Aurane Waters will get his fleet of dromonds\nhowever, and Cersei will find the coin by deferring the crown's debt to the \nFaith of the Seven\n and to the \nIron Bank\nof Braavos\n until the end of the \nwar\n. Pycelle warns her against this route, cautioning that it would be foolish to make\nan enemy of the Iron Bank, but the decision is made regardless.\nThe council also discusses the prudence of making someone pay for the \nRed Wedding\n so as to appease all the\n\"sparrows\"; and in the mean time offering whomever succeeds the sure-to-die-soon Lord \nWalder Frey\n a chance to\nrid himself of unwanted brothers, half-brothers and nephews.\nOn the topic of the \nNorth\n, the council indicates that Stannis may soon be confronted by \nRoose Bolton\n's army, once\nhis bastard son\n hits \nMoat Cailin\n from the north, allowing the Lord of the \nDreadfort\n passage through \nthe Neck\n. Cersei\nmentions that \nWyman Manderly\n has taken \nDavos Seaworth\n captive, after the latter was sent by Stannis to treat with\nhim. When \nSansa\n is mentioned, Cersei shocks the council into silence with a violent tirade about how she plans to\ndeal with the girl once she is found. In the uneasy silence that follows, Cersei also remarks that Lord Bolton\npossesses \nArya Stark\n and that her marriage to his bastard should appease the north, keeping to herself the fact that\n\"Arya Stark\" is really a \"\nsteward's whelp\n\" provided by Littlefinger.\nNext they debate the fact that the \nNight's Watch\n might be joining its might to Stannis, especially now that \nJon Snow\n\nis their Lord Commander. The council decides to warn the Watch that the crown will stop sending men to the Wall,\nbut Qyburn suggests that they do send 100 men.
