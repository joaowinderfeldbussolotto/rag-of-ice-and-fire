Despite his crew's unease at \nMoqorro\n's continued presence,\nVictarion insists that the \nRed God\n will help them on their journey. Though his arm and hand are now burned, they\nare stronger than ever. He says, \n“Two gods are with me now...No foe can stand before two gods.”\nThe Iron Fleet captures a number of trading ships: \nGhiscari Dawn\n, \nDove\n, two unnamed ships that he renames as\nGhost\n and \nShade\n, an unnamed fat galleas, an unnamed trading galley, an unnamed fishing ketch, and a slaver galley\nnamed the \nWilling Maiden\n. Moqorro's prophecies are instrumental in the capture of these fleets. As a show of his\nappreciation, Victarion burns seven \nLyseni\n bed slaves as a tribute to both the \nDrowned God\n and R'hllor. After this\nsacrifice, a favourable wind rises for the Iron Fleet, which now numbers 60 ships with the new additions.\nThat night, Victarion allows Moqorro to inspect the \nDragon Horn\n given to him by his brother \nEuron\n. Moqorro reads\nthe \nValyrian\n glyphs displayed on the horn to Victarion, telling him that the horn's name is written as \n\"I am\nDragonbinder\n.\"\n Moqorro goes on to explain that no mortal man can blow the horn and live.

The \nkindly man\n informs Arya that she will need a new face for this job, since Cat of the Canals would\nbe easily recognized. He and the \nwaif\n lead her down into a hidden chamber deep under the \nHouse of Black and\nWhite\n. The walls are covered with mask-like faces, which Arya realizes are the faces of people who die at the House\nof Black and White. The face chosen for Arya is that of a young girl who was abused to the point of permanent\ndisfigurement, and came to the House seeking death.\nArya's blood is used to soften the leathery mask into living skin, which then bonds to her head and becomes her new\nface. The kindly man warns Arya that she will suffer the nightmares of the girl whose face she has taken, but only\nfor a time. His promise proves to be true, and that night Arya dreams of the abuse that was suffered by the girl at the\nhands of her father. The next day, Arya is given her first target. He is an \nelderly man\n running an insurance scam at a\nshipyard.\nThe target is always accompanied by two guards, and the kindly man has forbidden her to kill anyone other than her\ntarget, so Arya must stalk the man for several days to find an opportunity. She eventually dispatches him by slipping\na poisoned coin into the purse of his client, knowing the man selling insurance will bite into the coin to test its\nlegitimacy. The Kindly Man is pleased by her success, and raises her to the status of an acolyte. He gives her a black\nand white robe to wear while at the House and restores her face. However, the next day she is to take a new face and\nleave for her first apprenticeship with someone named \nIzembaro\n.\nNavigation:\nThe Blind Girl\n↑\nVictarion I\n ←\nThe Ugly Little Girl\n→
