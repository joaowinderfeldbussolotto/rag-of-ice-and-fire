Uncomfortable with the warmth of the room, which\nis heated by hot springs beneath the castle, Ned opens the windows. As she watches him from the bed, Catelyn\nthinks he looks the same as when she married him and hopes they have conceived another child.\nThe couple discuss King \nRobert\n's offer, which Ned intends to refuse. Catelyn insists that he must accept so as not to\noffend the king, which might put them all in danger. While Catelyn contemplates the omen of the \ndirewolf\n killed by\na \nstag\n, Ned wishes his brother \nBrandon\n had lived to be Lord of Winterfell instead.\nThey are interrupted by a guardsman named \nDesmond\n, who says that \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n has an urgent message. The\nmaester is shown in and explains that a carved wooden box containing a fine new glass lens was left in his\nobservatory while he was napping. The way it was delivered made the maester wonder and he discovered a message\nhidden beneath a false bottom. Maester Luwin says he has not read it, and will not give it to Ned because it is\naddressed to Catelyn.\nCatelyn takes the message apprehensively. It is from her sister \nLysa\n and written in a secret language only the two\nsisters share. Catelyn immediately burns the message after reading it, but explains to Ned that the message claims\nJon Arryn\n was murdered by Queen \nCersei\n and her \nfamily\n. Catelyn insists that now Ned \nmust\n be the \nHand of the\nKing\n, to find the truth behind Lysa's accusations. Maester Luwin agrees with Catelyn, pointing out that the Hand's\nauthority will help determine the truth and protect Lysa and \nher son\n. Ned reminds them both that \nhis father\n went\nsouth once at the summons of a king and never returned. Luwin replies that that was a different time and a different\nking. Catelyn insist that if Ned truly loves King Robert like a brother, he will not leave him to face the Lannisters on\nhis own.\nNed then makes his decision: he will go, but Catelyn must stay behind to govern Winterfell and teach his heir \nRobb\nhow to be a proper lord. He allows that young \nRickon\n may stay with her as well, but the others must come south--\nSansa\n to wed \nJoffrey\n, and \nArya\n to learn the ways of a southern court. Catelyn reluctantly agrees, but begs that seven-\nyear-old \nBran\n be allowed to stay. Ned insists that Bran must bridge the gap between Robb and Joffrey. The house\nwill be the safer for it, and Catelyn has to agree. Catelyn feels lonely already.\nMaester Luwin asks about \nJon Snow\n and Catelyn's anger flashes. She remembers the bastard child that Ned brought\nback with him in the early days of their marriage. She understood Ned fathering a bastard son, but could not\nunderstand raising a bastard in the castle. There were rumors that \nAshara Dayne\n was the boy's mother, but Ned\nforbade Catelyn to ask about it, insisting that all she needed to know was that Jon was his blood. Ned would never\nsend Jon away though, and Catelyn could never forgive him that. Catelyn insists that Jon must leave Winterfell, but\nNed argues that there will be no place for Jon at court. Maester Luwin mentions Jon's ambitions to join the \nNight's\nWatch\n. Ned considers this for a while and finally agrees to let Jon take the black, though not until they are ready to\nleave for the south; he wants Jon to enjoy his last few days. Ned decides that when it is time, he will tell Jon himself.\n\nNavigation:\nCatelyn I\n↑\nJon I\n ←\nCatelyn II\n→ \nArya I\n↓\nCatelyn III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 7: Arya I\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn II\n ←\nArya I\n→ \nBran II\n↓\nArya II\nArya\n runs out on her needlework session to watch the boys practice with swords in the yard.\nSynopsis\nArya\n is dismayed at her crooked stitches; she can't match her sister \nSansa\n's needlework.
