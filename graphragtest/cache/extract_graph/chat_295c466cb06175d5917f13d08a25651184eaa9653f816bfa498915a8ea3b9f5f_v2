There \nOsha\n and \nHodor\nunstrap him and carry him to the high seat. Ser Rodrik, his daughter \nBeth\n, and \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n are seated to Bran's\nleft and \nRickon\n to his right, his hair uncut since \ntheir mother\n left because he bit the last girl to try. After Ser Rodrik\nbellows for quiet, Bran welcomes the guests and asks them to thank the gods for \nRobb\n's victories and the bountiful\nharvest. His toast of \"May there be a hundred more,\" brings an echoing cheer and Ser Rodrik says \nhis father\n would\nbe proud.\nThey feast on course after course, including seafood brought by Lord \nWyman Manderly\n from \nWhite Harbor\n.\nManderly has also brought musicians, but only \nHodor\n seems to be listening and the songs are drowned beneath the\ntalk and laughter. Ser Rodrik and Maester Luwin talk over Beth's head, while Rickon screams happily with \nLittle\nWalder\n and \nBig Walder\n. Bran did not want the Walders at the high table but Maester Luwin reminded him they\nwould become kin when Robb weds one of their aunts and Arya marries their uncle \nElmar Frey\n, though Bran argued\nArya would never stand for that.\nEach dish is served to Bran first, and soon he is full and must nod approval rather than taste everything. As\ninstructed, he sends particularly delicious dishes to the lords as a gesture of friendship: salmon to sad Lady \nDonella\nHornwood\n, boar to \nMors\n and \nHother Umber\n, goose-in-berries to \nCley Cerwyn\n, lobster to \nJoseth\n the master of horse\nfor training Dancer, sweets to Hodor and Old \nNan\n because he loves them, and beets and turnips to the Walders\nbecause Ser Rodrik insists he give them something.\nBran watches the feast detachedly, seeing everything yet a part of nothing. He sees Osha break a flagon over the\nhead of a \nTallhart\n man for sliding his hand under her skirts, though another woman does not seem to mind \nMikken\n's\nhand down her bodice. He watches \nFarlen\n make his red bitch beg and Old Nan pluck at the crust of a hot pie. On the\ndais, he sees Lord Manderly attacking a plate of lampreys in his special wide chair, sad Lady Hornwood picking\nlistlessly at her food, and the Umber brothers playing a drinking game.\nThe heat and noise soon grow too much and Bran finds himself dreaming of the cool in the \ngodswood\n. Studying his\nfather's ornate goblet, Bran recalls the \nwelcoming feast\n for King \nRobert\n and realizes everyone else is gone—either to\nwar, captivity, \nthe Wall\n, or their graves. Even the men at the tables are new, since everyone who went south with his\nfather is dead and the rest rode to war with Robb. When he wonders who will be missing next year and the year\nafter, Bran feels like crying but reminds himself he is the Stark in Winterfell and almost a man grown.\nThe doors to the hall open and \nAlebelly\n leads in two new guests: \nMeera\n and \nJojen Reed\n of \nGreywater Watch\n. Bran\nrecognizes them as \ncrannogmen\n from \nthe Neck\n, a shy and simple folk who rarely leave their swamps, but he hears\n\nLittle Walder calling them \"mudmen\" and explaining to Rickon that they are thieves and cravens with green teeth\nfrom eating frogs. As places are hurriedly prepared on the dais, Ser Rodrik explains that these must be the children\nof \nHowland Reed\n, a great friend and staunch companion of Bran's father during \nRobert's Rebellion\n.\nThe slender girl Meera is armed with woven net, bronze knife, and frog spear as well as an iron helm, leather shield,\nand bronze-scale jerkin. Her younger brother Jojen is unarmed and dressed all in green, which brings out the deep\ngreen of his eyes. Kneeling before the dais, the Reeds explain that they have come to renew \nHouse Reed\n's fealty to\nthe \nKing in the North\n. Bran explains that Robb is away fighting but says they may say their words to him. Together,\nthe Reeds recite their ancient oath, swearing by earth and water, by bronze and iron, and by ice and fire never to fail\nthe Starks of Winterfell. Unsure how to respond, Bran finally decides on \"May your winters be short and your\nsummers bountiful,\" and bids them rise. Meera offers gifts of fish, frog, and fowl, and Bran offers them the meat and\nmead of Winterfell in return.\nJojen immediately asks where the \ndirewolves\n are and Rickon answers that they are in the godswood because\nShaggydog\n was bad. When Meera says that Jojen would like to see them, Little Walder warns that they will bite.\nPleased by the Reeds' interest, Bran promises that Summer at least will not bite and will keep Shaggydog away. He\ncannot recall ever meeting a crannogman and would like to talk more, but the feast is too noisy.
