She thinks that Lord Tywin never used whores and defensively tells a guard how he treated his own\nfather's mistress after his death, parading her naked through the streets of \nLannisport\n. Qyburn suggests that Lord\nTywin might have been questioning the girl about her mistress \nSansa Stark\n's disappearance. Cersei eagerly seizes on\nthis notion but has a vision of Tyrion mocking it. She can't stand staying in the room with the girl any longer and\ngoes back to the hall.\nShe finds Ser Osmund accompanied by his brothers \nOsney\n and \nOsfryd\n and orders them to make certain that nobody\nwill ever hear about the dead girl in her father's bed. Her body is to be disposed of no matter how and everyone who\ntalks about this matter will have their tongues torn out. She watches as the Kettleblacks put the girl's body in a\nblanket, remembering that the girl's name was \nShae\n and that she came to her the night before Tyrion's trial by\ncombat, asking that promises made to her by Tyrion and, allegedly, Cersei be kept, including a manse in the city and\na knight to marry. Cersei made it clear that she would get nothing until she told them the whereabouts of Sansa\nStark, making her leave in tears. She orders the Kettleblacks to carry Shae's body out through the secret passage, but\nwants to have the chain around her neck delivered to herself.\nAs Ser Osfryd is about to step into the tunnel, Jaime emerges from it. She rushes towards him, asking whether he\nhas found the killers, but is told that the shaft ends in a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet, some of them\nclosed with locked iron gates, and Jaime needs to find keys first. He suggests that the killers could still be hiding in\nthe maze he just left. Cersei again envisions Tyrion climbing through the walls like some monstrous rat, then\nreassures herself with the thought that he is in his cell. She says she wants the murderers to be found and that the\nwhole tower will be demolished if need be. Jaime hugs her to console her and she has a rush of desire for him. She\nwhispers in his ear, asking him to take over as \nHand of the King\n to complete their father's work. But he pushes her\naway, declines the offer, makes a joke about a Hand without a hand and says that she shouldn't ask him to rule.\nCersei feels the rejection like a slap, realizing that it has been noticed by everyone present and that the whole castle\nwill know soon. She angrily says that she didn't ask him to rule, as she is going to do that herself as the Queen\nRegent until Tommen comes of age. Jaime replies that he doesn't know whom to feel worse for, Tommen or the\nSeven Kingdoms\n. She slaps him. They are both admonished by Ser Kevan to take their indecent behavior out of the\nroom where their father's body lies. Jaime apologizes for his sister, pointing out that she is forgetting herself while\ngrief-stricken. This makes Cersei want to slap him again and regret her impulse to ask him. She wonders whether the\nposition of Hand should be abolished altogether, remembering how \nJon Arryn\n and \nEddard Stark\n meddled in her\naffairs, the latter forcing her to get rid of King Robert before she could deal with his brothers, and how Tyrion sold\nMyrcella\n to \nDorne\n, made Tommen a hostage and killed Joffrey.\nCersei settles on her uncle Kevan as the next Hand, as she considers him loyal and prudent while unambitious to\nchallenge her as the real power behind the Iron Throne. She thinks that she needs men supporting her and that the\ncurrent \nsmall council\n will not do, with Grand Maester Pycelle too old and Lord \nMace Tyrell\n and his bannermen\nLord \nPaxter Redwyne\n and Lord \nMathis Rowan\n not to be trusted; she also can't rely on Jaime, who has lost his\ncourage with his hand. She again considers the possibility of the Tyrells being involved in the murder, as Lord Mace\nmust have known he can never rule the Seven Kingdoms as long as Tywin Lannister is alive. However, she realizes\nshe has to proceed carefully against the Tyrells, with the city full of their men and \nLoras Tyrell\n now knight of the\n\nKingsguard. The thought of the engagement of Tommen and \nMargaery Tyrell\n still makes her furious and she\nquestions Margaery's virginity. Cersei intends to use \nVarys\n to find out more on this front.\nThe thought of Varys makes Cersei aware that the eunuch isn't present, while he is usually around when something\nimportant happens in the Red Keep. The only explanation for his absence is that he was involved in the plot,\npreempting his own downfall as Lord Tywin never had any love for him. She thinks that Varys might have known\nabout the secret passage and acted on behalf of Stannis. She orders Ser Meryn to find the \nMaster of Whisperers\n and\nbring him to her.\nSer Boros returns red-faced and puffing, announcing that Tyrion is gone, his cell open, with no sign of him\nanywhere. Cersei is appalled, thinking her nightmares are coming true. She points out her orders to keep the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TYWIN LANNISTER<|>PERSON<|>Lord Tywin Lannister is a powerful
