The\nLannisters\n are granting \nRiverrun\n to Ser \nEmmon Frey\n and Kevan's sister \nGenna\n, once the \nBlackfish\n has surrendered.\nThey legitimize \nRamsay Snow\n and name \nRoose Bolton\n \nWarden of the North\n. Ser \nRolph Spicer\n is granted\nCastamere\n, and raised to lord, and Lord \nGawen Westerling\n, \nhis wife\n, and daughter \nJeyne\n are all granted a royal\npardon, along with Lord \nJonos Bracken\n, Lord \nVance\n, Lord \nGoodbrook\n and Lord \nMooton\n for entering King\nTommen's service. Jaime had recently lost during a spar with Ser \nAddam Marbrand\n, and is disgusted that he cannot\nfight left-handed, especially after receiving the new \nValyrian sword\n from \nhis father\n.\nOutside, Jaime watches Steelshanks \nWalton\n and his men prepare to leave \nKing's Landing\n, and sees a girl who claims\nto be \nArya Stark\n. Jaime is pretty sure she is not the real Arya, yet she is to be presented to Roose Bolton and Ramsay\nBolton at the \nDreadfort\n. Ser \nGregor\n's screams from \nPycelle\n's solar can be heard throughout the \nRed Keep\n, for Lord\nTywin has demanded that the Grand Maester heal him so that the \nKing's Justice\n can execute him (rather than dying\nfrom a poisoned spear) in the hopes of placating \nDorne\n and \nHouse Martell\n, who are likely to be outraged by Prince\nOberyn's\n death. Jaime recalls his father mentioning that \nStannis\n and his fleet have left \nDragonstone\n, leaving only a\ntoken force to guard the island. Unlike Pycelle, Tywin believes Stannis has not conceded defeat; he has only left\nDragonstone because he intends to continue fighting elsewhere. He will likely fail if he goes to \nStorm's End\n and tries\nto rally the Stormlands, but if Stannis wins Dorne to his cause, he can prolong \nthe war\n for months or even years, so\nTywin will not give Dorne any reason to side with Stannis.\nLater, \nCersei\n visits him in the \nWhite Sword Tower\n, and reveals that their father plans to send her back to \nCasterly\nRock\n so that he will have a free hand in raising Tommen, in addition to marrying Tommen to \nMargaery Tyrell\n, but\nJaime refuses to talk to their father to convince him otherwise. Their conversation turns to the subject of \nBran Stark\n;\nCersei berates him again for throwing the boy from the tower, but when Jaime questions her about \nthe assassin\nCatelyn Stark\n accused them of sending after the boy, Cersei denies it. When Cersei mentions that \nRobert\n himself, at\nWinterfell\n, said it would be kinder to put the boy out of his misery while alone with her and their children, Jaime\nfigures out that it was \nJoffrey\n, 'desperate for a pat on the head from that sot', who sent the assassin to kill \nBran\n, even\nthough Cersei does not believe him when he tells her his suspicions, just as Jaime does not believe her when Cersei\ninsists again that \nTyrion\n is responsible for Joffrey's death. When she begins to unlace Jaime's breeches, he sends her\noff in anger.\nJaime then has \nBrienne\n and Ser \nLoras\n brought before him, and the Knight of Flowers reveals that after speaking\nwith the woman, he now believes she may be innocent. Ser Loras is dismissed, and Jaime reveals his belief that\nTyrion is innocent, and that the girl sent north with Steelshanks was not the real Arya Stark; his father has found\nsome \nnorthern girl of a similar age and appearance\n, and with her immediate family dead or missing, there is no one\nto say otherwise. Ser Jaime then commands Brienne to find and protect Lady Catelyn's daughters, as they had both\npledged to do, and gives her the Valyrian sword he had so recently received from his father, explaining that it was\nforged from the metal taken from \nEddard Stark\n's greatsword \nIce\n, melted down after his execution, saying, \"\nA sword\nso fine must bear a name. It would please me if you would call this one '\nOathkeeper\n'....You'll be defending Ned\nStark's daughter with Ned Stark's own steel... \nSansa Stark\n is my last chance for
