Jon and Sam are taken to a \ngodswood\nbeyond the Wall\n to say their vows before the \nold gods\n. After they have taken their vows, \nGhost\n returns with a human\nhand in his jaws.\nSynopsis\nJon\n is eating breakfast when \nSam\n excitedly tells that he has been passed out of training with Jon and the rest. Jon\nfeigns surprise and Sam explains that he will be working for \nMaester\n \nAemon\n, who needs somebody who can read\nand write to work in the library and with the birds. Sam is concerned about getting to the \nsept\n in time, otherwise the\nofficers may change their minds. When they arrive at the sept the other recruits are genuinely shocked to see Sam,\nbut no one dares to say a word.\nAll the officers arrive together. \nLord Commander\n \nJeor Mormont\n makes his customary speech about taking vows and\nbeing a member of the \nNight's Watch\n. Mormont asks if any wish to leave before taking their vows, but no one does.\nThen Mormont asks if any of them follow the \nold gods\n and Jon speaks up. The recruits whisper that there is no\ngodswood\n at \nthe Wall\n. Mormont confirms that \nCastle Black\n has no need of a godswood since the \nhaunted forest\nbeyond the Wall stands as it did in the \nDawn Age\n and there is a \nweirwood\n grove half a league from the castle. It is\nthen that Sam speaks up that he also wants to swear his vows before the \nheart tree\n, despite being born into the \nFaith\nof the Seven\n. When Ser \nJaremy Rykker\n questions why Sam would forsake the gods of his \nHouse\n, Sam declares that\nthe Night’s Watch is his House now and the Seven have never answered his prayers.\nAt the end of the ceremony, the Lord Commander announces the assignments: \nHalder\n and \nAlbett\n to the builders;\nGrenn\n, \nPypar\n, \nTodder\n, and \nMatthar\n to the rangers; Samwell, \nDareon\n, and Jon to the stewards. Jon is flabbergasted\nand believes there must be a mistake, but when he sees Ser \nAlliser Thorne\n’s black eyes studying him he knows it is\nan intentional snub. The Lord Commander pronounces his last words and leaves. The Firsts call the recruits from\neach of the groups.\nAfter the rest are gone, Lord Steward \nBowen Marsh\n states that Sam will work in the library and rookery with\nMaester Aemon, since \nChett\n has been reassigned to the kennels. Dareon will be sent to \nEastwatch\n to work with the\nmerchants. Jon will be personal steward to the Lord Commander at Mormont's own request. Jon sarcastically\nsuggests a number of menial duties for himself and is told “certainly” and given several more duties. When Jon asks\nif they take him for a servant, Maester Aemon answers that they took him for a man of the Night’s Watch, though\nperhaps they were wrong.\nOutside in the yard, Jon rants about the unfairness of his appointment, since he is a better swordsman and rider.\nDareon is angered by Jon’s tantrum, since he himself was unfairly sent to the Wall for a false accusation. Sam quiets\nJon by telling him the Lord Commander probably intends to groom him for command. Sam explains that \nhis father\nonce insisted that he be at his side for all important events\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_42d3f230f7ba429ff0ef97d3037d2c399b3052d36eb73fba8f7c776c137bff38_v2"}
