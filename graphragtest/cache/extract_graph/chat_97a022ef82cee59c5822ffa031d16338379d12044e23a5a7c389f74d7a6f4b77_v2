Being too small to help, Tyrion (as is his custom) goes away from the camp with a book about \ndragons\n,\none of several brought with him from Winterfell. Tyrion has always been interested in dragons. He remembers\nseeking out the dragon skulls in \nKing's Landing\n the first time he was there. He recalls having a torch with him when\nhe discovered the skulls and having the sensation that they seemed to like it when he put his torch to them. There\nwere three skulls much larger than the others and one of the skulls could have swallowed a mammoth whole. Tyrion\nrecalls that King \nLoren I\n, an ancestor of the \nLannisters\n, had been about to defeat \nAegon I Targaryen\n in battle when\nthe Targaryens \nunleashed\n all three of their dragons and made short work of their opponents.\nAs Tyrion reads he is approached by Jon Snow, who asks why he reads so much. Tyrion explains that because his\nbody is twisted and weak he must rely on his mind and that a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.\nWhen Jon asks what Tyrion is reading, Tyrion begins to explain about dragons and how he fantasized about them as\na child when feeling resentful toward his family.\nWhen Tyrion goes so far as to suggest that Jon must feel resentment towards his own family, Jon protests. However\nTyrion continues to push the issue, sarcastically describing how Lady \nCatelyn\n treats him as one of her own, how\nRobb\n is kind because he is the heir, and how Eddard Stark must have had a good reason to pack Jon off to the \nWall\n.\nWhen Jon replies that the Night’s Watch is a noble calling, Tyrion describes the Watch as a midden heap for the\nrealm’s debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards, all kept busy watching for imaginary \ngrumkins\n and \nsnarks\n.\nWhen Jon asks him to stop, Tyrion realizes what he has been saying and feels badly. Reaching out to comfort Jon,\nhe is attacked and knocked down by Jon’s \ndirewolf\n, \nGhost\n. Unable to get up on his own, Tyrion is forced to\napologize to Jon before receiving help. When Tyrion questions why the wolf attacked, Jon jokes that Ghost must\nhave mistaken Tyrion for a grumkin, which amuses them both.\n\nHaving calmed down, Jon asks Tyrion if the things he said of the Night’s Watch were true. When Tyrion says yes,\nJon accepts the truth grimly. The two share some wine and return to camp for a supper of squirrel stew. Tyrion is the\nlast to retire, and Jon has the first watch.\nNavigation:\nTyrion I\n↑\nEddard II\n ←\nTyrion II\n→ \nCatelyn III\n↓\nTyrion III\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 14: Catelyn III\nPlace(s): \nWinterfell\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn II\n↑\nTyrion II\n ←\nCatelyn III\n→ \nSansa I\n↓\nCatelyn IV\nCatelyn\n's breakdown over \nBran's\n fall ends when an attempt is made on Bran's life. Catelyn delays \nthe assassin\n long\nenough for Bran's \ndirewolf\n to arrive and kill the assassin. Catelyn is now convinced Bran did not fall, but was\npushed.\nSynopsis\nEight days after \nEddard\n and the others have left \nWinterfell\n, \nCatelyn\n is still sitting at \nBran's\n bedside in her fragile\nmental state. \nMaester\n \nLuwin\n comes to tell her how much \nthe king's\n visit has cost them, but Catelyn is not interested\nin looking at figures. Regardless, the maester continues to speak of replacing provisions. Catelyn insists that the\nsteward can worry about such matters. Luwin reminds her that \nVayon Poole\n went south with Lord Eddard and needs\nto be replaced, along with a number of other positions. Catelyn is outraged that he can think of such trivial things\nwhen Bran is dying until \nRobb\n arrives to take charge of the appointments.\nAfter the maester leaves, Robb asks Catelyn what she thinks she's doing spending all her time with Bran and not\neven saying farewell to her own family. Catelyn insists she can't bear to be away from Bran, in case he should die.\nRobb assures her that Bran is not going to die and reminds her that her other children need her, too. He goes on to\nexplain that \nRickon\n just follows him around all day crying, thinking everyone has abandoned him.\nRobb hears a \ndirewolf\n howling outside and opens the window, explaining that the sound seems to be good for Bran.\nWhen the other direwolves join in, Catelyn screams for Robb to make the noise stop and then collapses to the floor.\nRobb helps her up but she only begins screaming again. Then Robb notices the dogs barking as well and sees the\nlibrary tower afire.\nWhile Robb rushes off to fight the fire, Catelyn remains behind with Bran. When she turns away from the window,\nhowever, she is face-to-face with \na filthy man\n brandishing \na knife\n. The man claims that Catelyn was not supposed to\nbe there and moves towards Bran, claiming that killing him would be a mercy. Catelyn attempts to scream for help,\nbut the man is too\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_97a022ef82cee59c5822ffa031d16338379d12044e23a5a7c389f74d7a6f4b77_v2"}
