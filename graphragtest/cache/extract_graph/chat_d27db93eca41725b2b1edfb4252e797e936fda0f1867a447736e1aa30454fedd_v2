He also learns from \nPycelle\n and \nPetyr Baelish\n that Lord \nTywin\nLannister\n is preparing for a war. Later, Ned meets with Cersei and tells her that he will tell \nRobert\n the truth when he\nreturns, offering her the chance to flee and save her children. Cersei warns that Ned has made a mistake.\nSynopsis\nGrand Maester\n \nPycelle\n tells \nEddard Stark\n that the pain means that the bone is healing, but Ned only replies that he\nwill be happy when his leg stops throbbing. Pycelle provides him with the \nmilk of the poppy\n for the pain, but Ned\nsays he sleeps too much already. Pycelle tells him sleep is good for healing.\nPycelle informs Ned that Queen \nCersei\n has received a letter from her father. Lord \nTywin\n is angry about Ned sending\nmen to bring Ser \nGregor Clegane\n to justice. Ned replies that it does not bother him; Lord \nBeric Dondarrion\n rides\nunder the king’s banner and if Lord Tywin attempts to interfere he will have \nRobert\n to answer to, and the only thing\nRobert likes better than hunting is making war on defiant lords. Pycelle leaves, telling Ned that he will come again\nthe next day.\nNed knows Pycelle is Cersei’s creature, and doesn’t care. He is not actually confident in Robert, but he does not\nwant Cersei to know that. He calls for honeyed wine, which will not cloud his mind as badly as the milk of the\npoppy, because he needs to think. Ned thinks how sometimes a child’s innocent eyes can see things that grown men\nare blind to and how some day he will have to tell \nSansa\n how she made it all come clear to him.\nLittlefinger\n pays a visit an hour after Pycelle leaves, bringing news that \nVarys\n has heard whispers that \nsellswords\n are\nflocking to \nCasterly Rock\n. Ned asks about Robert and is told that, having found the white hart dead, the king is now\nafter a fierce boar. Most of the hunting party has returned, however, including Prince \nJoffrey\n and \nthe Hound\n.\nLittlefinger states that he would have liked to have seen the Hound’s reaction to learning that \nBeric Dondarrion\n is\nafter the \nbrother\n he hates. With that Littlefinger leaves for a dinner, but not before noting the book of \nThe Lineages\nand Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms\n, and teasingly asking if it is a sleeping potion.\nNed considers that, outside of his retainers, there is not a man in the city he trusts: Littlefinger leaving before the\nslaughter\n of his guard rankles him, Varys knows too much and does too little, Pycelle is Cersei’s, and Ser \nBarristan\nis too old and rigid in his sense of duty.\nArya\n and Sansa will sail in three days. Ned knows that honor will require him to go to Robert with all he knows\nwhen he returns. Last night he dreamed of when Lord Tywin had presented the bodies of Prince \nRhaegar\n’s children\nto Robert. Ned remembers that Robert could be merciful if a man were brave and honest; he had pardoned Ser\nBarristan, Varys, Pycelle, \nBalon Greyjoy\n, and Littlefinger and let them keep their office for an offer of fealty.\nHowever poison in the dark he will never forgive and would kill them all. \nBran\n must have learned some part of the\ntruth; otherwise they would not have tried to kill him. Ned decides that he must find a way to save the children.\nNed calls in \nFat Tom\n, now in command of his guardsmen and asks to be taken to the \ngodswood\n. Ned also orders the\nguard doubled despite the shortage of manpower. Ned sends Tom to find Queen Cersei and give her a letter inviting\nher to join him. As he sits in the godswood, Ned feels the presence of his gods under the faceless \nheart tree\n and his\n\nleg does not seem to hurt as much.\nWhen Cersei arrives at nightfall, Ned notes that she is proudly displaying the bruise Robert has given her. For the\nfirst time in a long time, Ned can see her beauty. When he declares that he knows the truth \nJon Arryn\n died for,\nCersei scoffs whether he has brought her here to pose riddles or to kidnap her. Ned replies that if she believed such\nthings she would not have come. He then asks about the bruise, and if Robert does such things often. She replies that\nit has never been on the face before and that her brother Jaime would have killed Robert if he knew.\nWhen Ned suggests a correction of “brother” to “lover,” Cersei does not trouble to deny it. Cersei admits that she\nand Jaime have been lovers since they were children and that when Jaime is in her she feels whole. When Ned asks\nabout his son Bran, Cersei admits that he saw her and Jaime, offering her love for her own children as a reason for\nthe attempted murder. Ned counters with a declaration that all three of Cersei’s children are Jaime\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "mistral-medium-latest", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d27db93eca41725b2b1edfb4252e797e936fda0f1867a447736e1aa30454fedd_v2"}
