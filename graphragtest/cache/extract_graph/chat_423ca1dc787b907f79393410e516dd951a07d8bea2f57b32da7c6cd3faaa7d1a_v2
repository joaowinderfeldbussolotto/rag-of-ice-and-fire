She sees the ugly face of \nJanos Slynt\n at the council table\nand remembers how he threw down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead. She also notices how he nods approvingly at\neach of Joffrey’s brutal judgements. She wishes some hero would cut off his head but knows there are no heroes,\nremembering \nPetyr Baelish\n telling her that life is not a song. Sansa thinks “In life, the monsters win.” The last case\nis a singer accused of singing a song ridiculing King \nRobert Baratheon\n. He is made to sing the song before the court\nand Sansa thinks it is funny; in some verses it seems like he is singing about the queen. Joffrey gives the man the\noption of keeping his fingers or his tongue.\nWhen the court is dismissed, Sansa flees the balcony only to be met by Joffrey, Ser Meryn, and the Hound. Joffrey\nexamines her and tells her she looks much better. Sansa thanks him with hollow words. Joffrey then tells her to walk\nwith him—the touch of his hand now makes her skin crawl. He asks her what she will get him for his coming name\nday, but Sansa admits that she was unaware it was near. Joffrey tells her that she is truly a stupid girl, and that his\nmother has said so and is worried their children will be stupid as well. Despite her expectations, the words still hurt\nSansa and she realizes that the Hound was right: she is “only a little bird, repeating the words they taught her.”\nJoffrey then tells her that he will get her with child as soon as possible, and if the child is stupid, she will lose her\nhead and he will find a smarter wife. He asks when she can have children and she tells him, not being able to look at\nhim, that Septa \nMordane\n told her twelve or thirteen.\nSansa now realizes they are going up onto the battlements and begs not to go there. Joffrey insists that he wants to\nshow her how traitors are punished. He also threatens to have Ser Meryn drag her if she refuses. The Hound\nencourages her to go and Sansa realizes that one way or the other she must go up, so she goes willingly. It seems\nlike she climbs a thousand steps to the top. Sansa looks out across the city to the countryside beyond and lets her\nimagination cross the hundreds of leagues north to her home in Winterfell. Joffrey demands to know what she is\nlooking at and instructs her to look at the heads of her father, her septa, and a dozen more. Her father’s head does\nnot look recognizable or even real. Sansa decides that they can make her look, but they cannot make her see. Joffrey\nis disappointed by Sansa’s hollow and stoic reaction.\nSansa cannot understand why they would kill Septa Mordane, but Joffrey insists she was a traitor as well. He asks\nagain what Sansa will give him for his name day as a preamble to declaring that instead he will bring Sansa the head\nof her traitor brother \nRobb\n. Joffrey explains that Robb used treachery and deceit to defeat his \nUncle Jaime\n. Sansa\nsuggests that Robb may give her Joffrey’s head. This mistake results in two harder blows by Ser Meryn. Joffrey\ncommands her to clean off the blood.\nFor a fleeting moment, Sansa realizes that it would only take a shove to send Joffrey over the parapet to splatter far\nbelow. Just as suddenly, the moment is gone when the Hound comes between her and Joffrey to dab the blood from\nher broken lip with surprising gentleness. She thanks the Hound; she is a good girl and remembers her courtesies.\nNavigation:\nSansa VI\n↑\nBran VII\n ←\nSansa VI\n→ \nDaenerys IX\n↓\nA Clash of Kings\nSansa I\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 68: Daenerys IX\nPlace(s): \nDothraki Sea\n \n \nNavigation:\nDaenerys VIII\n↑\nSansa VI\n ←\nDaenerys IX\n→ \nTyrion IX\n↓\nDaenerys X\nDaenerys\n has terrible nightmares during her long recovery.

Suddenly she is with \nDrogo\n under the open sky of the \nDothraki Sea\n.
