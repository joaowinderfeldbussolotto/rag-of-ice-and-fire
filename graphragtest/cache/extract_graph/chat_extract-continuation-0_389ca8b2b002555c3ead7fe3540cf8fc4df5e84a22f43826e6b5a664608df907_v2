The Karstarks are said to have\nStark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but the fierce men do not look like Starks to Bran.\nBran has not been allowed to leave the castle since the \nincident\n in the \nwolfswood\n. Robb insists that there are no men\navailable to guard him and is not dissuaded by Branâ€™s argument that \nSummer\n will protect him. The incident in the\nWolfswood shames Bran as he is not able to protect himself; even \nRickon\n would have been able to kick them. A\nyear ago he would have visited the village anyway, climbing over the walls, but now he can only watch with\nMaester Luwin and \nHodor\n.\nMaester Luwin has taught Bran all the banners and now he has faces to associate with them. Bran asks how many\nknights there are and Luwin tells Bran that there are over 12,000 men, but only 300 knights because \nthe North\n holds\nto the \nold gods\n and knights are anointed in a sept of the \nFaith of the Seven\n. However, Luwin assures him, \"a manâ€™s\nworth is not marked by a \nser\n before his name.\" Bran asks when they will leave and is told they must leave soon or\nthe countryside will be eaten clean. Robb has a long way to go and the fighting has started. More men will join Robb\nas he travels south.\nBran tells Hodor that he does not want to watch anymore. Maester Luwin reminds Bran that his brother is busy\ngreeting the Karstarks, but Bran assures him that he wants to visit the \ngodswood\n. Hodor now carries Bran in a basket\nstrapped to his back, an idea Luwin got from the baskets used by the serving women to carry firewood. Being\ncarried this way does not shame Bran the same as being carried like a baby, although Hodor sometimes forgets Bran\nis on his back when going through doorways.\nWhen Bran exits the castle there are Karstark men arriving. Some men mock him, but Bran has been warned of this\nby the maester. His attitude is to let them mock since he does not want to stay in his bedroom. Bran calls for\nSummer, and the Karstark horses reel as the \ndirewolf\n goes by.\nWhen Bran arrives in the godswood, he pulls himself out of his seat on Hodorâ€™s back using a branch of the\nweirwood\n. Then he lets Hodor lower him down beside the water and says he wants to be alone with Summer. Bran\nhas been finding himself drawn more to the \nheart tree\n and now he takes comfort from its deep red eyes; the old gods\nare watching over him. He feels safe and it gives him time to think, which he has been doing a lot of recently.\nBran prays for Robb not to go away, for the safety of his family, and for \nRickon\n to understand. Rickon has grown\nwild and violent since he learned that Robb was leaving. Once Rickon disappeared and, when he was finally found\n\ndown in the crypts, the youngest Stark had slashed at the men with a sword and \nShaggydog\n bit \nGage\n on the arm and\ntook a chunk out of \nMikken\nâ€™s thigh. It took Robb and \nGrey Wind\n to bring Shaggydog under control. After that\nFarlen\n chained Shaggydog in the kennels and now Rickon cries even more.\nLuwin and Bran have both asked Robb to stay but he refuses, saying he has no choice. Bran believes this is only half\na lie because Robb could send someone else to guard \nthe Neck\n. Robbâ€™s response was that their father would not send\nothers to die while he stayed behind the walls of Winterfell. Robb denies all who request being given supreme battle\ncommand. Many of the lords try to test Robb by making demands, but he is able to handle them much as his father\ndid and bend them to his will, even when anger flares. When \nGreatjon Umber\n demanded the right to command, he\ndrew his sword against Robb. \nGrey Wind\n immediately reacted by biting off two of his fingers. Since the incident,\nthe Greatjon has been Robbâ€™s staunchest supporter. That night, Robb came to Branâ€™s bedchamber pale and shaken.\nRobb also told Bran that the most frightening bannerman is \nRoose Bolton\n, who never says a word but only looks at\nhim. When Bolton does this, all Robb can think of is the room in the \nDreadfort\n where the Boltons hang the skins of\ntheir enemies. Bran states that this is only a story of \nOld Nan\nâ€™s, but then asks for confirmation.\nThere are many horrible stories that come with travelers, and it is impossible to say which is real, although some are\nobviously untrue. Then the letter from Sansa arrived with the seal of House Stark. After Robb had read the letter he\ncrushed it. Sansa had said nothing of Arya and Robb asked what is wrong with her. Bran replied that Sansa has lost\nher wolf, remembering the day four of the guardsmen returned with bones of \nLady\n. They buried the bones in the\ncemetery with the faithful servants of Winterfell; she went south and only her bones returned, like Lord \nRickard\nStark\n, \nBrandon Stark\n, and two hundred men, and none returned.
