When she turns away from the window,\nhowever, she is face-to-face with \na filthy man\n brandishing \na knife\n. The man claims that Catelyn was not supposed to\nbe there and moves towards Bran, claiming that killing him would be a mercy. Catelyn attempts to scream for help,\nbut the man is too quick as he moves to slit her throat. Catelyn manages to grab the blade with her hands and push it\naway, cutting her fingers badly. She bites the man's hand and fights her way free. The man is about to attack her\nagain when Bran's direwolf leaps onto him and rips out his throat. Once the man is dead, the direwolf settles down\non Bran's bed.\nCatelyn is taken back to her chambers. \nOld Nan\n undresses her and helps her into a bath. After the bath, Maester\nLuwin dresses Catelyn's wounds: her fingers are cut almost to the bone and the man had pulled out a handful of hair.\nThe maester gives her milk of the poppy, which puts her to sleep. She wakes up four days later. It seems like a\nnightmare, but the pain in her hands reminds her that it was real. When Catelyn remembers her behavior since Bran's\nfall she is ashamed, promising herself that it will not happen again.\nRobb, now wearing armor and a sword, comes to see her with \nTheon Greyjoy\n, Ser \nRodrik Cassel\n, and \nHallis Mollen\n,\nthe new \ncaptain of the guard\n. Hal tells her that nobody knows who the man was, but he had likely been lurking in the\nstables since the king's visit. Where the man had been hiding they found ninety \nsilver stags\n hidden under the straw.\nWhen Robb asks why anybody would want to kill Bran, Catelyn insists that as a \nlord\n he must learn to answer his\nown questions. Robb guesses that somebody is afraid of what Bran might do or say if he wakes up and so posts a\n\nheavy guard on Bran.\nRodrik points out that the dagger used by the assassin, a \nValyrian steel\n blade with a \ndragonbone\n handle, is a much\nfiner weapon than anything the low-born footpad should have possessed; someone must have given it to him.\nCatelyn then tells Rodrik, Theon, and Robb in strict confidence of her sister \nLysa's\n suspicions about the death of \nJon\nArryn\n. She reminds them that \nJaime Lannister\n did not go hunting with the others the day Bran fell, and that she does\nnot believe that Bran fell, but that he was pushed. The group admits that this is a reasonable conclusion.\nHowever, Maester Luwin points out that all they have is conjecture, and that they must have proof or else keep\nsilent. After some deliberation, Catelyn decides that she and Rodrik will go to \nKing's Landing\n by ship to inform\nEddard, hopefully arriving ahead of the king’s party.\nNavigation:\nCatelyn II\n↑\nTyrion II\n ←\nCatelyn III\n→ \nSansa I\n↓\nCatelyn IV\n\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 15: Sansa I\nPlace(s): \ninn at the crossroads\n \nnear the \nruby ford\n \n \nNavigation:\nCatelyn III\n ←\nSansa I\n→ \nEddard III\n↓\nSansa II\nAfter exploring the camp, \nSansa Stark\n goes riding with her betrothed, Prince \nJoffrey\n. Near the \nruby ford\n, they come\nupon \nArya Stark\n and a \nbutcher's boy\n play-fighting. Joffrey begins to torment the boy until Arya attacks him.\nSynopsis\nSansa\n is having breakfast with \nSepta\n \nMordane\n in an \ninn\n near the \nTrident\n. When Sansa feeds her \ndirewolf\n \nLady\n under\nthe table, the septa says that although Sansa is a good girl she is as willful as her sister Arya when it comes to her\ndirewolf.\nThe septa informs Sansa that they have been invited to ride in the wheelhouse with Queen \nCersei\n and Princess\nMyrcella\n. Sansa has been looking forward to this for a week, hoping for a chance to be with Prince \nJoffrey\n. Joffrey\nis everything she ever wanted her prince to be like: tall and strong and handsome. The one thing Sansa is afraid of is\nthat Arya will ruin everything for her. Septa Mordane wants Sansa and Arya to dress well for the event and Sansa\nhas already decided on a fine silk dress. She does not expect Arya to wear anything appropriate. Sansa begs to be\nexcused so she can look for Arya.\nShe finds Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to comb the mud out of her direwolf \nNymeria\n's fur. Arya is not\ninterested in riding in the wheelhouse, and intends to go riding with \nMycah\n to look for \nrubies\n in the river. Sansa\ninsists that there is no fun in riding because there is nothing to see, but Arya is fascinated by all the new flowers and\nlandmarks and people they are seeing along the way. Sansa informs Arya that she has to come, asking why anyone\nwould want to ride a stinky horse when they could ride\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
