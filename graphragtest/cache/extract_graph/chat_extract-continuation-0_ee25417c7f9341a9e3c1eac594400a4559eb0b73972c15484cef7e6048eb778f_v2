Tyrion wants his cousin found, mostly because the boy’s father \nTygett\n was always kind to Tyrion. He is\ndismayed to learn from \nJacelyn Bywater\n that many of the \nCity Watch\n and the common folk consider Tyrion the\nproblem in the city, and would revolt given the chance.

He learns\nthat Stannis has been having terrible nightmares, and that only Lady \nMelisandre\n can soothe him to sleep. She has\nbeen sharing his pavilion of late, and he wonders how she soothes him to sleep.\nSer \nCortnay Penrose\n arrives to parley with Stannis, and scorns the king and all his new-found allies who were so\nrecently sworn to \nRenly\n. He especially mocks Lord \nAlester Florent\n, for not only changing sides, but changing gods\nas well.\nSer Cortnay will not accept Stannis’ demands, and will not surrender \nStorm's End\n nor \nRobert\n’s bastard \nEdric Storm\n.\nThe Castellan throws his gauntlet in King Stannis’ face, and proposes single combat to settle the issue. Stannis\nrejects him, stating he will take the castle by storm if he must, to which Ser Cortnay responds, \"Bring on your storm\n- and recall, if you do, the name of this castle.\" Stannis dismisses all his men save Davos, seeking the former\nsmuggler’s advice. Davos states his respect for Ser Cortnay, who kept his faith, unlike all these new lords in Stannis’\narmy. Stannis dislikes them as much, but he needs their strength in order to win his throne. Stannis sent Ser \nParmen\nCrane\n to \nBitterbridge\n to gather the rest of Renly’s army, but there has been no word since. He tells Davos that he\ngrieves for his brother Renly, and dreams of a green pavilion and the manner of Renly’s death, even though he was\nin bed at the time of Renly’s demise. Stannis says, \"…but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go\nto my grave thinking of \nmy brother’s peach\n.\"\nDavos advises him to strike for \nKing's Landing\n at once, but Stannis will not leave Storm’s End untaken in his rear,\nfor men will consider him defeated there. Stannis then tells Davos that he must have the boy \nEdric Storm\n, as\nMelisandre has seen it in her flames; and she has also seen Ser Cortnay’s death, as she saw Renly’s at \nDragonstone\n.\nThe king commands Davos to bring Melisandre by boat under the cover of darkness beneath Storm’s End, as he did\nsome 15 years before.\nThat night, Davos is sickened by what he must do for his king. He asks Melisandre if she is good or evil, and she\nresponds, \"Oh, good. I am a \nknight\n of sorts myself. A champion of light and life.\" Davos calls her a liar, for she\nmeans to kill a man this very night, as she killed \nMaester Cressen\n and Renly. The Red Woman responds that the\nmaester poisoned himself, and that she had nothing to do with Renly’s death. However, she later admits that Renly\nwas unprotected, while the walls of Storm’s End have spells woven into the stones, and that no shadow can pass\nfrom the outside. When Davos proclaims that a shadow is a thing of darkness, Melisandre rebuffs him, stating that\nshadows don’t exist in the dark, they are servants of light and fire, provided by her god, \nR'hllor\n.\nWhen they arrive at a gate in a water tunnel beneath the castle, Melisandre disrobes, and Davos watches in horror as\nthe now pregnant woman gives birth to a shadow, and Davos recognizes the man who cast it.\nNavigation:\nDavos I\n↑\nTyrion IX\n ←\nDavos II\n→ \nJon V\n\n↓\nDavos III\n\nA Clash of Kings -
