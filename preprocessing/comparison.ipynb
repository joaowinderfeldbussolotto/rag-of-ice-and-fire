       "\n",
       "The death of Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, was a pivotal event that triggered a series of political and military conflicts in Westeros, ultimately leading to the Red Wedding. Initially attributed to natural causes, it was later revealed that Jon Arryn was poisoned by Cersei Lannister after discovering her incestuous relationship with Jaime and the true lineage of her children. This assassination was orchestrated with the help of Lysa Arryn and Littlefinger, using the deadly poison Tears of Lys [Data: Reports (292, 95, 293, 297, 268, +more)].\n",
       "\n",
       "Jon Arryn's death created a power vacuum and sparked unrest in the Vale and beyond, setting in motion a chain of events leading to the War of the Five Kings. His widow, Lysa Arryn, became increasingly paranoid and protective of her son, Robert Arryn, which led to her retreating to the Eyrie and isolating herself from the broader conflicts. This isolationism affected the Vale's involvement in the War of the Five Kings and set the stage for Littlefinger's manipulation of the region [Data: Reports (297, 268, 294, 293, 95)].\n",

Ned Stark's investigation into Jon Arryn's death uncovered the secret of Cersei Lannister's children's true parentage, which ultimately led to his own downfall and execution [Data: Reports (127, 148, 250, 268, 292)]. This event sparked Robb Stark's declaration of war against the Lannisters and his proclamation as the King in the North. Robb's military campaigns and alliances were crucial in the early stages of the War of the Five Kings [Data: Reports (250, 268, 231, 23, 7)].\n",

These actions by the Lannisters provoked conflict and resentment among the noble houses, setting the stage for broader political turmoil [Data: Reports (93, 44, 0, 2, +more)]. The Lannisters' involvement in Jon Arryn's death, whether direct or perceived, deepened the feud between House Stark and House Lannister.

Littlefinger, who had been manipulating events from the shadows, played a significant role in orchestrating the Red Wedding.

Her travels took her to various cities, each playing a crucial role in her political and military endeavors.\\n\\n#### Pentos\\n\\nDaenerys Targaryen\\'s journey began in Pentos, a prominent Free City where she was married to Khal Drogo. This strategic alliance, arranged by Magister Illyrio Mopatis, provided her with the support of the Dothraki and set the stage for her future endeavors. In Pentos, she received dragon eggs as a wedding gift, symbolizing her connection to her Targaryen heritage and her future as a leader [Data: Reports (6, 177, 168, 41, 24, +more)].\\n\\n#### The Dothraki Sea and Vaes Dothrak\\n\\nAccompanying Khal Drogo and his khalasar, Daenerys traveled through the Dothraki Sea, a vast and harsh region.

The dagger is associated with Littlefinger, also known as Petyr Baelish, a master manipulator who engages in elaborate schemes to achieve his goals. This connection illustrates Littlefinger\\'s deceptive nature and his involvement in the assassination attempt on Bran Stark [Data: Reports (127, 294)].\\n\\n#### Longclaw\\n\\nLongclaw is the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Mormont. Initially owned by House Mormont, it is later passed to Jon Snow by Jeor Mormont, the Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch. This transfer of ownership is significant as it symbolizes Jon Snow\\'s growing importance and leadership within the Night\\'s Watch. The act signifies Mormont\\'s mentorship and trust in Jon Snow\\'s leadership. Longclaw represents honor and recognition for Jon\\'s bravery and potential. Jon\\'s decision to leave Longclaw behind marks a turning point in his journey, reflecting his internal conflict and the evolution of his loyalties beyond the Night\\'s Watch [Data: Reports (4, 53, 192, 210)].\\n\\n#### Oathkeeper\\n\\nOathkeeper is another Valyrian steel sword that holds significant symbolic value. Given to Brienne by Jaime Lannister, the sword represents trust, respect, and her oath to protect the innocent. Oathkeeper is not only a powerful weapon but also a symbol of Brienne’s moral integrity and her role as a formidable warrior. The sword’s origins, forged from the metal of Ice, the ancestral greatsword of House Stark, add to its storied legacy and importance in the series [Data: Reports (212)].\\n\\n#### Lady Forlorn\\n\\nLyn Corbray wields the Valyrian steel sword *Lady Forlorn* and is a member of the Lords Declarant, underscoring his influence and ambition [Data: Reports (296)].\\n\\n#### Tobho Mott\\'s Role\\n\\nTobho Mott, a master armorer and smith renowned for his craftsmanship, particularly in working with Valyrian steel. His expertise in Valyrian steel sets him apart from other blacksmiths, as few possess the skill to rework or forge Valyrian steel. This expertise not only enhances his reputation but also positions him as a key figure in the production of high-quality armor and weapons, which are critical in the political and military landscape of Westeros [Data: Reports (310)].\\n\\n### Commentary\\n\\nThe movement of Valyrian steel weapons is often tied to significant political and personal relationships. For example, the gifting of Oathkeeper to Brienne by Jaime Lannister signifies a bond of trust and respect between the two characters. Similarly, the passing of Longclaw from Jeor Mormont to Jon Snow reflects a mentorship and recognition of Jon\\'s potential. These weapons are not merely tools of war but are imbued with deep symbolic meanings that reflect the values and relationships of the characters who wield them.\\n\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n**✅ Successful methods:** naiverag, graphrag-globalsearch\\n\\n'"

       "During the War of the Five Kings, several noble houses in Westeros switched their allegiances, driven by a complex interplay of political strategy, personal ambition, and survival instincts. These shifts in loyalty were pivotal in shaping the outcome of the war and the balance of power in the Seven Kingdoms.\n",
       "\n",
       "### House Frey\n",
       "\n",
       "House Frey's betrayal at the Red Wedding is one of the most notorious examples of switching sides. Initially, they were allies with House Stark through a marriage pact between Robb Stark and a Frey daughter. However, they secretly allied with House Bolton and House Lannister, betraying and killing Robb Stark and his forces during the Red Wedding. This switch was motivated by political advantage and the promise of power and favor from the Lannisters. The Freys' control over the strategic location of The Twins and their ruthless political maneuvering were key factors in their decision to switch sides. The betrayal was also driven by Walder Frey's desire to secure his family's political position and gain favor with the Lannisters, who were in a stronger position to win the war. Additionally, Robb Stark's broken marriage pact with the Freys deeply offended them, leading to their decision to support his enemies [Data: Reports (78, 137, 239, 241, 242, +more)].\n",

However, Roose Bolton secretly allied with House Lannister and betrayed Robb Stark during the Red Wedding. This switch was motivated by a desire for power and control over the North, as well as personal ambition and the promise of being named Warden of the North by the Lannisters. Roose Bolton's strategic and ruthless leadership led to the betrayal of Robb Stark at the Red Wedding, where he allied with the Freys to massacre Robb Stark and his forces. This act solidified his position as Warden of the North and demonstrated his willingness to abandon loyalty for power. Roose's control over key locations like the Dreadfort and Harrenhal further underscored his strategic importance [Data: Reports (78, 238, 239, 250, 74, +more)].\n",

       "House Tyrell initially supported Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne, displaying their golden rose sigil at his camp. However, they later shifted their allegiance to Joffrey Baratheon, demonstrating their pragmatic approach to power and strategic alliances. This switch was likely motivated by the desire to maintain and enhance their political influence and military strength in the volatile landscape of Westeros. The Tyrells' forces were instrumental in saving King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater, and this alliance was motivated by strategic political maneuvering and the promise of power and influence. The shift of House Tyrell's allegiance from Renly to Joffrey Baratheon was pivotal in securing Joffrey's victory in the Battle for King's Landing. This change was driven by the Tyrells' ambition to maintain and enhance their political standing and military strength in Westeros. The Tyrells also allied with House Lannister after Renly's death, motivated by the opportunity to gain political power and influence, as well as to secure the safety and interests of their family. Their strategic alliance with the Lannisters was solidified through the marriage of Margaery Tyrell to King Joffrey Baratheon [Data: Reports (64, 129, 227, 61, +more)].\n",

       "### House Karstark\n",
       "\n",
       "House Karstark, initially loyal to House Stark, switched sides during the War of the Five Kings. Rickard Karstark, the leader of House Karstark, was motivated by vengeance after the deaths of his sons at the hands of Jaime Lannister. This led him to murder Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, defying Robb Stark's authority and resulting in his own execution. His actions weakened the northern cause and strained alliances. After Robb Stark executed Rickard Karstark for treason, the Karstarks abandoned the Stark cause and allied with House Lannister. This shift was motivated by a desire for vengeance and a belief that the Starks had betrayed their trust. The Karstarks then allied with House Bolton, further strengthening the Boltons' position in the North. Initially, they supported Stannis Baratheon, with Arnolf Karstark urging Stannis to attack the Dreadfort and offering his men to join Stannis' forces. However, Arnolf Karstark's true intentions aligned more closely with the Boltons, as revealed by his alliance with Roose Bolton. This shift was motivated by opportunism and personal gain, demonstrating Arnolf Karstark's willingness to switch sides for political advantage [Data: Reports (160, 30, 152, 221, 59, +more)].\n",

       "House Manderly switched sides during the War of the Five Kings, initially supporting House Stark but later aligning with House Bolton after the Red Wedding. This change was motivated by the strategic necessity to survive and maintain their position in the North following the devastating betrayal and defeat of House Stark. Lord Wyman Manderly of House Manderly, initially a loyalist to House Stark, switched sides to support House Bolton after the Red Wedding. This change was motivated by the need to protect his family and people from further harm and to navigate the complex political landscape of the North. His true loyalties remain ambiguous, as he continues to harbor resentment towards the Boltons and Freys for their betrayal of the Starks. Initially, they supported Robb Stark's campaign, contributing 1,500 men to his army. However, their loyalty shifted due to the betrayal at the Red Wedding, where Robb Stark and his forces were massacred by House Frey and House Bolton. This betrayal led House Manderly to oppose House Frey and House Bolton, reflecting their deep involvement in the region's power struggles and their commitment to the Stark cause [Data: Reports (78, 60, 7, 27, +more)].\n",

The Umbers are known for their strategic approach to alliances, offering their support only under specific conditions. Mors Umber is a staunch supporter of Stannis Baratheon, while Hother Umber is coerced into fighting for House Bolton. This highlights how houses may switch sides due to coercion or strategic advantage. Hother Umber, a member of House Umber, is noted to fight under duress for House Bolton, indicating a shift in allegiance likely due to coercion or strategic necessity rather than voluntary choice. This change underscores the complex and often dangerous dynamics of power and survival in the North, where houses may be forced to align with stronger or more threatening powers to ensure their safety or interests [Data: Reports (79, 256)].\n",

However, after Renly's death, Ser Cortnay Penrose, who commanded the garrison at Storm's End, refused to surrender to Stannis Baratheon, indicating a shift in allegiance. This change was motivated by loyalty to Renly and resistance to Stannis' claim. House Penrose is a noble house that played a crucial role in the political and military landscape of Westeros by supporting Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne. This allegiance aligns House Penrose with other noble houses that backed Renly, reflecting their commitment to his leadership and ambitions. However, after Renly's death, their allegiance might have shifted to another house, such as House Baratheon or House Lannister, to maintain their political standing [Data: Reports (56, 215)].\n",

       "House Hightower initially supported Renly Baratheon but later shifted their allegiance to the Lannisters after Renly's death. This change was likely motivated by the desire to maintain their political influence and power in the realm. House Hightower aligned itself with Renly Baratheon during the War of the Five Kings, lending its support to his claim for the Iron Throne. This allegiance underscores the house's strategic importance and its willingness to engage in the broader conflicts shaping the realm [Data: Reports (56, 213)].\n",

       "### House Florent\n",
       "\n",
       "House Florent had divided loyalties during the War of the Five Kings. While some members of the house supported Renly Baratheon, others sided with Stannis Baratheon. This division was motivated by strategic alliances and familial ties to both Renly and Stannis. Alester Florent, a member of House Florent, initially supported House Tyrell but later switched his allegiance to Stannis Baratheon. This change was motivated by personal ambition and the opportunity to gain power and influence under Stannis's rule. However, his betrayal was short-lived as he was later accused of plotting against Stannis, leading to his downfall. House Florent was initially aligned with Stannis Baratheon due to marital bonds, as Selyse Florent is the wife of Stannis. However, they also supported Renly Baratheon, Stannis' younger brother and rival claimant to the Iron Throne. This dual allegiance reflects the complex web of loyalties and power struggles within the realm [Data: Reports (213, 56, 61)].\n",

       "\n",
       "Many of Stannis Baratheon's bannermen bent the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon following the heavy losses suffered during the Battle of King's Landing. This change was motivated by the desire to align with the perceived winning side and to avoid further losses and retribution [Data: Reports (15)].\n",
       "\n",
       "### House Bracken\n",
       "\n",
       "House Bracken switched sides by aligning with House Lannister, motivated by Tywin Lannister's promise of lands in exchange for their loyalty. This shift was driven by the desire for political gain and increased power within the realm. Jonos Bracken was granted a royal pardon for pledging his service to King Tommen, suggesting a pragmatic shift in allegiance to secure his position. This indicates that Jonos Bracken, and by extension House Bracken, switched sides to align with the Lannisters and King Tommen, likely motivated by political survival and the promise of royal favor. House Bracken is described as a house that might be swayed to change sides through bribery, reflecting the shifting loyalties in the war-torn Riverlands. This suggests that House Bracken may have switched sides during the War of the Five Kings, motivated by the promise of lands from Tywin Lannister if they subdued House Blackwood [Data: Reports (27, 136, +more)].\n",

       "### House Tully\n",
       "\n",
       "House Tully, led by Catelyn Stark, initially supported House Stark and the cause of Robb Stark. However, after the Red Wedding and the fall of House Stark, the Tullys found themselves in a precarious position. Edmure Tully, the head of the house, was forced to surrender to House Lannister and House Frey, effectively switching sides to ensure the survival of his house and people. This change was driven by the necessity of survival and the lack of other viable options. House Tully, particularly through Edmure Tully, initially supported Robb Stark's campaign but faced significant challenges and eventual betrayal. Edmure's actions, such as dispersing men to guard the Red Fork, inadvertently disrupted Robb Stark's strategic plans and contributed to the downfall of the Stark-Tully alliance. His capture during the Red Wedding and subsequent imprisonment by the Lannisters highlight the consequences of the betrayal and the shift in power dynamics [Data: Reports (139, 153, 156)].\n",

Balon saw an opportunity to reclaim the North for the Ironborn and declared independence, attacking and capturing key locations such as Winterfell and Deepwood Motte. His motivation was to restore the Iron Islands' former glory and independence from the Iron Throne [Data: Reports (121)].\n",

If you need further details, additional context would be required.\\n\\n</div>\\n<div style=\"flex: 1; min-width: 300px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px;\">\\n<h3>graphrag-globalsearch</h3>\\n\\n### Overview of House Allegiance Shifts During the War of the Five Kings\\n\\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, several noble houses in Westeros switched their allegiances, driven by a complex interplay of political strategy, personal ambition, and survival instincts. These shifts in loyalty were pivotal in shaping the outcome of the war and the balance of power in the Seven Kingdoms.\\n\\n### House Frey\\n\\nHouse Frey\\'s betrayal at the Red Wedding is one of the most notorious examples of switching sides. Initially, they were allies with House Stark through a marriage pact between Robb Stark and a Frey daughter. However, they secretly allied with House Bolton and House Lannister, betraying and killing Robb Stark and his forces during the Red Wedding. This switch was motivated by political advantage and the promise of power and favor from the Lannisters. The Freys\\' control over the strategic location of The Twins and their ruthless political maneuvering were key factors in their decision to switch sides. The betrayal was also driven by Walder Frey\\'s desire to secure his family\\'s political position and gain favor with the Lannisters, who were in a stronger position to win the war. Additionally, Robb Stark\\'s broken marriage pact with the Freys deeply offended them, leading to their decision to support his enemies [Data: Reports (78, 137, 239, 241, 242, +more)].\\n\\n### House Bolton\\n\\nHouse Bolton, led by Roose Bolton, initially appeared to be loyal to Robb Stark, serving as one of his banner-men. However, Roose Bolton secretly allied with House Lannister and betrayed Robb Stark during the Red Wedding. This switch was motivated by a desire for power and control over the North, as well as personal ambition and the promise of being named Warden of the North by the Lannisters. Roose Bolton\\'s strategic and ruthless leadership led to the betrayal of Robb Stark at the Red Wedding, where he allied with the Freys to massacre Robb Stark and his forces. This act solidified his position as Warden of the North and demonstrated his willingness to abandon loyalty for power. Roose\\'s control over key locations like the Dreadfort and Harrenhal further underscored his strategic importance [Data: Reports (78, 238, 239, 250, 74, +more)].\\n\\n### House Tyrell\\n\\nHouse Tyrell initially supported Renly Baratheon\\'s claim to the Iron Throne, displaying their golden rose sigil at his camp. However, they later shifted their allegiance to Joffrey Baratheon, demonstrating their pragmatic approach to power and strategic alliances. This switch was likely motivated by the desire to maintain and enhance their political influence and military strength in the volatile landscape of Westeros. The Tyrells\\' forces were instrumental in saving King\\'s Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater, and this alliance was motivated by strategic political maneuvering and the promise of power and influence. The shift of House Tyrell\\'s allegiance from Renly to Joffrey Baratheon was pivotal in securing Joffrey\\'s victory in the Battle for King\\'s Landing. This change was driven by the Tyrells\\' ambition to maintain and enhance their political standing and military strength in Westeros. The Tyrells also allied with House Lannister after Renly\\'s death, motivated by the opportunity to gain political power and influence, as well as to secure the safety and interests of their family. Their strategic alliance with the Lannisters was solidified through the marriage of Margaery Tyrell to King Joffrey Baratheon [Data: Reports (64, 129, 227, 61, +more)].\\n\\n### House Karstark\\n\\nHouse Karstark, initially loyal to House Stark, switched sides during the War of the Five Kings. Rickard Karstark, the leader of House Karstark, was motivated by vengeance after the deaths of his sons at the hands of Jaime Lannister. This led him to murder Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, defying Robb Stark\\'s authority and resulting in his own execution. His actions weakened the northern cause and strained alliances. After Robb Stark executed Rickard Karstark for treason, the Karstarks abandoned the Stark cause and allied with House Lannister. This shift was motivated by a desire for vengeance and a belief that the Starks had betrayed their trust. The Karstarks then allied with House Bolton, further strengthening the Boltons\\' position in the North. Initially, they supported Stannis Baratheon, with Arnolf Karstark urging Stannis to attack the Dreadfort and offering his men to join Stannis\\' forces. However, Arnolf Karstark\\'s true intentions aligned more closely with the Boltons, as revealed by his alliance with Roose Bolton. This shift was motivated by opportunism and personal gain, demonstrating Arnolf Karstark\\'s willingness to switch sides for political advantage [Data: Reports (160, 30, 152, 221, 59, +more)].\\n\\n### House Manderly\\n\\nHouse Manderly switched sides during the War of the Five Kings, initially supporting House Stark but later aligning with House Bolton after the Red Wedding. This change was motivated by the strategic necessity to survive and maintain their position in the North following the devastating betrayal and defeat of House Stark. Lord Wyman Manderly of House Manderly, initially a loyalist to House Stark, switched sides to support House Bolton after the Red Wedding. This change was motivated by the need to protect his family and people from further harm and to navigate the complex political landscape of the North. His true loyalties remain ambiguous, as he continues to harbor resentment towards the Boltons and Freys for their betrayal of the Starks. Initially, they supported Robb Stark\\'s campaign, contributing 1,500 men to his army. However, their loyalty shifted due to the betrayal at the Red Wedding, where Robb Stark and his forces were massacred by House Frey and House Bolton. This betrayal led House Manderly to oppose House Frey and House Bolton, reflecting their deep involvement in the region\\'s power struggles and their commitment to the Stark cause [Data: Reports (78, 60, 7, 27, +more)].\\n\\n### House Umber\\n\\nHouse Umber\\'s involvement in Northern politics showcases the complex and often dangerous dynamics of power and survival in the region. The Umbers are known for their strategic approach to alliances, offering their support only under specific conditions. Mors Umber is a staunch supporter of Stannis Baratheon, while Hother Umber is coerced into fighting for House Bolton. This highlights how houses may switch sides due to coercion or strategic advantage. Hother Umber, a member of House Umber, is noted to fight under duress for House Bolton, indicating a shift in allegiance likely due to coercion or strategic necessity rather than voluntary choice. This change underscores the complex and often dangerous dynamics of power and survival in the North, where houses may be forced to align with stronger or more threatening powers to ensure their safety or interests [Data: Reports (79, 256)].\\n\\n### House Penrose\\n\\nHouse Penrose switched sides during the War of the Five Kings. Initially, they were loyal to Renly Baratheon. However, after Renly\\'s death, Ser Cortnay Penrose, who commanded the garrison at Storm\\'s End, refused to surrender to Stannis Baratheon, indicating a shift in allegiance. This change was motivated by loyalty to Renly and resistance to Stannis\\' claim. House Penrose is a noble house that played a crucial role in the political and military landscape of Westeros by supporting Renly Baratheon\\'s claim to the Iron Throne. This allegiance aligns House Penrose with other noble houses that backed Renly, reflecting their commitment to his leadership and ambitions. However, after Renly\\'s death, their allegiance might have shifted to another house, such as House Baratheon or House Lannister, to maintain their political standing [Data: Reports (56, 215)].\\n\\n### House Hightower\\n\\nHouse Hightower initially supported Renly Baratheon but later shifted their allegiance to the Lannisters after Renly\\'s death. This change was likely motivated by the desire to maintain their political influence and power in the realm. House Hightower aligned itself with Renly Baratheon during the War of the Five Kings, lending its support to his claim for the Iron Throne. This allegiance underscores the house\\'s strategic importance and its willingness to engage in the broader conflicts shaping the realm [Data: Reports (56, 213)].\\n\\n### House Florent\\n\\nHouse Florent had divided loyalties during the War of the Five Kings. While some members of the house supported Renly Baratheon, others sided with Stannis Baratheon. This division was motivated by strategic alliances and familial ties to both Renly and Stannis. Alester Florent, a member of House Florent, initially supported House Tyrell but later switched his allegiance to Stannis Baratheon. This change was motivated by personal ambition and the opportunity to gain power and influence under Stannis\\'s rule. However, his betrayal was short-lived as he was later accused of plotting against Stannis, leading to his downfall. House Florent was initially aligned with Stannis Baratheon due to marital bonds, as Selyse Florent is the wife of Stannis. However, they also supported Renly Baratheon, Stannis\\' younger brother and rival claimant to the Iron Throne. This dual allegiance reflects the complex web of loyalties and power struggles within the realm [Data: Reports (213, 56, 61)].\\n\\n### House Baratheon\\'s Bannermen\\n\\nMany of Stannis Baratheon\\'s bannermen bent the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon following the heavy losses suffered during the Battle of King\\'s Landing. This change was motivated by the desire to align with the perceived winning side and to avoid further losses and retribution [Data: Reports (15)].\\n\\n### House Bracken\\n\\nHouse Bracken switched sides by aligning with House Lannister, motivated by Tywin Lannister\\'s promise of lands in exchange for their loyalty. This shift was driven by the desire for political gain and increased power within the realm. Jonos Bracken was granted a royal pardon for pledging his service to King Tommen, suggesting a pragmatic shift in allegiance to secure his position. This indicates that Jonos Bracken, and by extension House Bracken, switched sides to align with the Lannisters and King Tommen, likely motivated by political survival and the promise of royal favor. House Bracken is described as a house that might be swayed to change sides through bribery, reflecting the shifting loyalties in the war-torn Riverlands. This suggests that House Bracken may have switched sides during the War of the Five Kings, motivated by the promise of lands from Tywin Lannister if they subdued House Blackwood [Data: Reports (27, 136, +more)].\\n\\n### House Tully\\n\\nHouse Tully, led by Catelyn Stark, initially supported House Stark and the cause of Robb Stark. However, after the Red Wedding and the fall of House Stark, the Tullys found themselves in a precarious position. Edmure Tully, the head of the house, was forced to surrender to House Lannister and House Frey, effectively switching sides to ensure the survival of his house and people. This change was driven by the necessity of survival and the lack of other viable options. House Tully, particularly through Edmure Tully, initially supported Robb Stark\\'s campaign but faced significant challenges and eventual betrayal. Edmure\\'s actions, such as dispersing men to guard the Red Fork, inadvertently disrupted Robb Stark\\'s strategic plans and contributed to the downfall of the Stark-Tully alliance. His capture during the Red Wedding and subsequent imprisonment by the Lannisters highlight the consequences of the betrayal and the shift in power dynamics [Data: Reports (139, 153, 156)].\\n\\n### House Greyjoy\\n\\nHouse Greyjoy, led by Balon Greyjoy, switched sides by launching a rebellion in the North while Robb Stark was fighting in the South. Balon saw an opportunity to reclaim the North for the Ironborn and declared independence, attacking and capturing key locations such as Winterfell and Deepwood Motte. His motivation was to restore the Iron Islands\\' former glory and independence from the Iron Throne [Data: Reports (121)].\\n\\n### House Hornwood\\n\\nHouse Hornwood, under the leadership of Lady Hornwood, was forcibly taken by Ramsay Bolton, who murdered her to gain control. This act of brutality and the subsequent power struggle may have led to shifts in allegiance, though the data does not explicitly state a change in loyalty [Data: Reports (254)].\\n\\n### House Tallhart\\n\\nHouse Tallhart, led by Leobald Tallhart, initially supported House Stark but faced significant losses, including the death of Leobald at the Battle of Winterfell and the capture and execution of Benfred Tallhart. These events may have influenced their allegiance, though specific motivations for switching sides are not detailed in the provided data [Data: Reports (22, 254)].\\n\\n### House Blackwood\\n\\nTytos Blackwood negotiated with Jaime Lannister, possibly seeking to secure terms for his house or mitigate further losses. This implies that House Blackwood may have considered switching sides or forming an alliance with the Lannisters, motivated by the need to protect their remaining stronghold, Raventree Hall, and ensure the survival of their house [Data: Reports (136)].\\n\\n### The Storm Lords\\n\\nThe Storm Lords, known for their loyalty to Renly Baratheon, initially supported his claim to the Iron Throne. However, after Renly\\'s death, their allegiance became uncertain. Their defiance and dismissive attitude toward authority, particularly in their interactions with Stannis Baratheon, suggest a potential shift in loyalty or at least a withdrawal of support. This change was likely motivated by the loss of their primary ally and the need to reassess their political position in the War of the Five Kings. The Storm Lords, a formidable group of noble lords from the Stormlands, initially supported Renly Baratheon\\'s claim to the throne. However, their dismissive attitude toward authority and their interactions with Stannis Baratheon suggest a potential shift in allegiance, possibly motivated by Renly\\'s death and the changing dynamics of the War of the Five Kings [Data: Reports (64, 228)].\\n\\n### The Wildlings\\n\\nThe Wildlings, led by Mance Rayder, initially posed a significant threat to the Night\\'s Watch and the Seven Kingdoms. However, some Wildlings, facing harsh conditions and food shortages, sought alliances with the Night\\'s Watch. This shift was motivated by the need for survival and shelter, as they moved southward in search of resources and protection from the harsh environment beyond the Wall [Data: Reports (194)].\\n\\n### The Crannogmen\\n\\nThe Crannogmen, while not a traditional noble house, played a strategic role in the War of the Five Kings. They initially supported Robb Stark by guiding his forces through treacherous terrain, ensuring safe passage for his army. However, their allegiance shifted as they besieged the Ironborn at Moat Cailin, showcasing their adaptability and guerrilla warfare tactics.

This switch was motivated by financial gain and the promise of power, as Cersei offered them more lucrative terms for their services [Data: Reports (94)].\\n\\n### The Brotherhood Without Banners\\n\\nThe Brotherhood Without Banners, while not a noble house, was a group of outlaws who initially fought against the Lannisters but later shifted their focus to protecting the innocent and seeking justice. Their change in motivation was driven by a sense of duty and the desire to uphold justice in the Riverlands [Data: Reports (303)].\\n\\n### The Second Sons\\n\\nThe Second Sons, a mercenary company, switched sides during the conflicts in Essos, initially aligned with the cities of Slaver\\'s Bay but later defected to Daenerys Targaryen.
