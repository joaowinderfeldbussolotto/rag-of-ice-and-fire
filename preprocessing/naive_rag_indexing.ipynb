Will has reported on wildlings that he found, claiming they are all dead. Gared, an older man\\nwho has been in the Night\\'s Watch for decades, is uneasy, and insists that they turn back to the \\nWall\\n; they have eight\\nor nine days of travel ahead of them, which can turn into a fortnight if it snows. Waymar, a noble born youth of\\neighteen, however, has the command, and after making light of Gared\\'s fears asks Will again for the details of what\\nhe saw.\\nWill explains that he saw the wildlings\\' encampment. Their lean-to was covered by snow, they had no fire, and none\\nof the wildlings moved the entire time he was watching. They were lying on the ground as if dead, but no blood was\\nvisible. Waymar suggests they might have been sleeping, but Will insists they are dead. There was also a woman up\\nin a tree, but she did not move either. Gared suggests the wildlings must have been killed by the cold, but Waymar\\npoints out that the weather has not been cold enough to freeze men like that. He asks Will to lead them to the dead\\nwildlings.\\nWith night falling, the rangers ride back to the wildling camp. Both Will and Gared sense something is wrong, but\\nWaymar mocks them again and commands Gared to stay behind to guard the \\nhorses\\n. When Gared suggests starting a\\nfire, Waymar sardonically orders him not to. Will fears that Waymar\\'s insolence will provoke Gared into drawing\\nhis sword, but Gared eventually acquiesces and no fire is lit.\\nWill and Waymar climb up the ridge, Waymar much noisier than Will. When Will reaches his previous vantage\\npoint, he sees that the bodies are gone. Waymar, walking upright, reaches the top of the ridge and stands in plain\\nsight. Will warns Waymar to get down, but Waymar just laughs. Determined to find the wildlings and make his first\\nranging a success, Waymar orders Will to climb a tree and look for a fire.\\nWill reluctantly climbs a nearby \\nsentinel\\n tree. Below him, Waymar challenges an unseen foe. Will thinks he sees a\\nwhite shadow moving below, but is not sure. He is about to call down a warning, but stops, unsure. Waymar calls to\\nWill with unease in his voice as he turns in a circle with his sword drawn, and asks about the sudden cold, which\\nWill also feels.\\nAn \\nOther\\n emerges from the woods: tall, gaunt, and white, dappled with a gray-green shimmer. Waymar nervously\\ncommands it to come no further and prepares himself for battle, challenging the Other to \"dance\" with him. Will\\nnotes that Waymar, in that moment, is no longer a boy, but truly a man of the Night\\'s Watch. When more Others\\nappear among the trees, Will considers calling out a warning, but decides not to do so, as it would require him to\\nreveal his position. The sword of the first Other is made of inhumanly-sharp translucent crystal. Waymar is able to\\ncheck the oncoming blows until his parry comes a bit too late and the Other\\'s sword cuts through the mail under his\\narm. Waymar screams \"For \\nRobert\\n!\" and charges, but as his blade strikes the Other\\'s sword, it shatters. One of the\\nshards hits Waymar\\'s left eye and he falls to his knees, blinded. All of the Others move in and slash at him\\nmercilessly.\\nWill turns his head away for a long time before looking back to see that the Others are gone. When he finally dares,\\nWill climbs down, examines Royce\\'s body, then picks up the knight\\'s twisted and broken sword. He decides to bring\\nit back to show to their commanders, hoping Gared is still with the horses. When Will stands up again, Waymar \\nhas\\n\\nrisen\\n and is standing over him. His remaining eye has turned blue. With an icy cold touch, Waymar\\'s hands go\\naround Will\\'s throat.\\nNavigation:\\nPrologue\\n→ \\nBran I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 1: Bran I\\nPlace(s): \\nNorth of \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nPrologue\\n ←\\nBran I\\n→ \\nCatelyn I\\n↓\\nBran II\\nLord \\nEddard Stark\\n dispenses justice to a \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n deserter. When they are on their way back to \\nWinterfell\\n, and\\nJon Snow\\n and \\nRobb Stark\\n find six orphaned \\ndirewolf\\n pups.\\nSynopsis\\nIt is the ninth year of summer Seven-year-old \\nBran Stark\\n is traveling with a party of twenty men, including his father\\nLord \\nEddard Stark\\n, to see the king\\'s justice done. This is the first time that he is allowed to join. Bran\\'s older brother\\nRobb\\n thinks the man to be executed must be a \\nwildling\\n sworn to \\nMance Rayder\\n, the \\nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\\n, which\\nmakes Bran think of the tales Old \\nNan\\n has told him about wildlings.\\nThe \\noffender\\n turns out to be an old man dressed in the ragged blacks of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n who has lost his ears and\\na finger to frostbite. Lord Eddard questions the man briefly. Then two guardsmen drag the man to the stump of a tree\\nand \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n, Eddard\\'s ward, brings Eddard his \\nValyrian steel\\n sword, \\nIce\\n. Eddard pronounces the sentence\\n(desertion of the Night\\'s Watch is punished by death) and raises the blade. \\nJon Snow\\n, Bran\\'s \\nbastard\\n brother,\\nreminds Bran not look away and so Bran watches as his father strikes off the man\\'s head with a single stroke. The\\nhead lands near Theon, who laughs and kicks it away. Jon calls Theon an ass under his breath and compliments Bran\\non his poise during the execution.\\nOn the way back to \\nWinterfell\\n, Robb and Jon argue about whether or not the deserter died bravely before racing\\ntheir horses to the bridge, leaving Bran and his pony behind. Eddard rides up and asks if Bran knows why he\\nexecuted the man himself. Bran replies that the man was a wildling. Eddard corrects that the man was a deserter,\\nthen explains that the \\nFirst Men\\n – of whom the \\nStarks\\n descendant – believed that the man who passes the sentence\\nshould perform the execution himself, lest he become too comfortable with ordering deaths; the Starks still hold to\\nthat principle.\\nJon calls from up ahead for them to come see what he and Robb have found. They find Robb holding something in\\nhis arms next to the corpse of a wolf larger than Bran\\'s pony. Jon correctly identifies the corpse as a \\ndirewolf\\n. Theon\\ncomments that direwolves have not been seen south of \\nthe Wall\\n for two hundred years. Bran then notices that Robb\\nis cradling a small pup, and gives it a stroke after Robb reassures him. Then Jon gives him another pup.\\nWhen they inspect the mother\\'s corpse, they find a large piece of shattered antler lodged in her throat. The soldiers\\nin the company feel this to be a bad omen. Theon offers to kill the pups but Bran protests. Eddard initially states\\nkilling them would be best but changes his mind when Jon points out that there are five pups, one for each of\\nEddard\\'s legitimate children; since the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, they must be meant to have the wolves.\\nBran immediately realizes, along with everyone else, that the comparison only works because Jon is not claiming a\\npup for himself.\\nRobb and Bran both declare that they are willing to nurse their pups by hand themselves. Eddard stresses that the\\nchildren must feed and raise the pups themselves, not pass them off to the servants, and must treat them well lest\\nthey become dangerous. Both Robb and Bran state they will not allow the pups to die. As they begin to ride away,\\nJon hears a noise and goes back to discover \\na sixth pup\\n, an albino with red eyes, that had crawled away from its\\nmother. Bran finds it curious that it is the only pup that has opened its eyes. Theon claims that the albino will die\\nquicker than the others, but Jon disagrees, claiming it for himself.\\nNavigation:\\n\\nPrologue\\n ←\\nBran I\\n→ \\nCatelyn I\\n↓\\nBran II\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 2: Catelyn I\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran I\\n ←\\nCatelyn I\\n→ \\nDaenerys I\\n↓\\nCatelyn II\\nLady \\nCatelyn Tully\\n seeks out her husband, Lord \\nEddard Stark\\n, in the \\ngodswood\\n of \\nWinterfell\\n to inform him of the\\nnews that his foster father, Lord \\nJon Arryn\\n, the \\nHand of the King\\n, is dead and that King \\nRobert I Baratheon\\n, his\\nfamily, and half his court are on their way to \\nWinterfell\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nCatelyn Stark\\n seeks out her husband \\nEddard\\n in the \\ngodswood\\n following his return to \\nWinterfell\\n. She knows her\\nhusband always goes there after executing a man. She finds the godswood very dark and unsettling compared to the\\nsunny one she remembers from her childhood home in \\nRiverrun\\n. Unlike her own \\nfamily\\n, the Starks keep faith with\\nthe \\nold gods\\n, rather than the \\nFaith of the Seven\\n.\\nShe finds Ned polishing his ancestral greatsword, \\nIce\\n, under the \\nheart tree\\n at the center of the grove. He asks after\\nthe children, and Catelyn tells him they are deciding on the names for their new wolves. Ned notes that the \\nman\\n he\\nexcecuted is the fourth deserter this year. He adds that the man was half mad, that something had put a fear into him\\nso deep that he could not reach him. The \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n is dwindling, down to less than a thousand men, not just\\nfrom desertions, but from ranging casualties. One day Ned may have to call his banners to fight \\nMance Rayder\\nhimself. Catelyn warns him that there are darker things beyond \\nthe Wall\\n. Ned replies that the \\nOthers\\n have been dead\\nfor eight thousand years, and that \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n claims they never existed at all. Catelyn replies that nobody had\\nseen \\ndirewolves\\n until today.\\nWhen Ned asks why Catelyn has come, she tells him that \\nJon Arryn\\n, his foster father and her brother-in-law, is dead.\\nThe news came in King \\nRobert\\n\\'s own hand. When asked, Catelyn explains that Jon Arryn\\'s widow--Catelynn\\'s sister\\nLysa Arryn\\n--and her \\nson\\n have returned to the \\nEyrie\\n and says that she thinks her sister should not be alone and should\\nhave gone back to \\nRiverrun\\n. Ned urges Catelyn to take the children to keep her sister company, but then Catelyn\\ninforms him that \\nRobert Baratheon\\n has also written to say he is coming to \\nWinterfell\\n. This news gladdens Ned; it\\nhas been nine years since he last saw his old friend. However, Catelyn is worried about the omen of a \\ndirewolf\\n found\\ndead in the snow with an \\nantler\\n buried in its throat.\\nWith Robert coming, Catelyn confirms with Ned that they should send word to his brother \\nBenjen\\n on \\nthe Wall\\n. Then\\nCatelyn informs Ned that Robert\\'s wife \\nCersei Lannister\\n, their children, and her \\nLannister\\n brothers are also coming.\\nNed does not like the Lannisters because they came to Robert’s cause only after \\nvictory\\n was certain. Eddard is\\nlooking forward to seeing the children and then announces his worry about feeding them all.\\nNavigation:\\nBran I\\n ←\\nCatelyn I\\n→ \\nDaenerys I\\n↓\\nCatelyn II\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 3: Daenerys I\\nPlace(s): \\nPentos\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn I\\n ←\\nDaenerys I\\n→ \\nEddard 1\\n↓\\nDaenerys II\\nThe exiled Princess \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n prepares to be presented to the \\nDothraki\\n \\nkhal\\n, \\nDrogo\\n, as her brother, King\\nViserys Targaryen\\n, hopes to gain a Dothraki \\narmy\\n by making such a \\nmarriage\\n alliance.\\nSynopsis\\nFor the past half year, the exiled king \\nViserys Targaryen\\n and his thirteen year old sister, Princess \\nDaenerys\\nTargaryen\\n, having been residing in the \\nmanse\\n of \\nIllyrio Mopatis\\n, a \\nMagister\\n of the \\nFree City\\n of \\nPentos\\n. Viserys\\nwishes to win back \\nhis father\\'s\\n \\nthrone\\n and is in need of an army, which he hopes to acquire by making a \\nmarriage\\nalliance with a \\nDothraki\\n \\nkhal\\n who leads a large \\nkhalasar\\n.\\nViserys presents Daenerys with a gift from Magister Illyrio, a fine silk dress. Daenerys has to look like the princess\\nshe is, so Khal \\nDrogo\\n will ask for her hand in marriage. Although Daenerys is doubtful of Illyrio\\'s motives, Viserys\\ninsists that the Magister simply wants to earn his good graces. Afraid of angering her brother (which he calls\\n\"waking the \\ndragon\\n\"), Daenerys keeps silent about her mistrust. Viserys warns Daenerys not to fail him, and twists\\none of her niples to emphasize his threat. According to Viserys, when history of his reign is written, it will be said\\nthat his reign began that night.\\nViserys departs, leaving Daenerys alone with her thoughts. She dreads the feast she has to attend that evening, and\\nher mind wanders to \\nWesteros\\n, the homeland she has never seen. She had been conceived shortly before her mother,\\nQueen \\nRhaella Targaryen\\n, fled \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n with Viserys, and born nine months later on \\nDragonstone\\n. Yet she\\nknows the stories Viserys has told her, the flight from King\\'s Landing to Dragonstone; Her eldest brother, \\nRhaegar\\nTargaryen\\n \\nfighting\\n \\nRobert Baratheon\\n and dying; The \\nSack of King’s Landing\\n, the gruesome death of Prince \\nAegon\\nTargaryen\\n, and the murder of her father, King \\nAerys II Targaryen\\n, in the throne room, committed by \\na knight\\n of his\\nown \\nKingsguard\\n. Nine months after the deaths of her brother and father, Daenerys\\'s mother died giving birth to her\\n(something for which Viserys has never forgiven her), during a summer storm which destroyed most of the\\nTargaryen\\n fleet which had been Dragonstone\\'s last defense. When the garrison of Dragonstone was wiling to give\\nViserys and Daenerys over to \\nStannis Baratheon\\n, who was \\non his way to take Dragonstone\\n, Ser \\nWillem Darry\\n and\\nfour loyal men secretly took them to \\nBraavos\\n. There they lived in a big \\nhouse with a red door\\n. However, Ser Willem\\ndied, leaving them without a guardian, and the servants stole what money was left. When Viserys and Daenerys\\nwere put out of the house not long afte, they began to travel from city to city, never staying anywhere long, as\\nViserys feared the Usurper\\'s assassins. Daenerys recalls how rich merchants, archons and magisters became less and\\nless willing to host the Targaryens as the years went by, and how Viserys had been forced to sell their mother\\'s\\ncrown. However, despite the lack of support, Viserys has become obsessed with recovering the Iron Throne.\\nDaenerys knows that he is being called \"the Beggar King\" behind his back, and wonders if people have given her a\\nnickname too.\\nIllyrio\\'s servants come to bathe Daenerys and prepare her for the feast given at the manse of Khal \\nDrogo\\n, where she\\nis to meet and impress the Khal, so he will ask for her hand in \\nmarriage\\n. The servants tell her how lucky she is to\\nmarry a man so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. Once she is properly dressed, her brother returns with\\nMagister Illyrio and commands her to stand up and turn around. Illyrio showers Daenerys with compliments while\\nViserys complains she is too skinny and too young. Illyrio reassures him that she is old enough for the \\nkhal\\n and\\ncomments on her silver-gold hair and purple eyes, the hallmarks of old \\nValyrian\\n nobility. When Viserys states that\\nbarbarians are said to have queer tastes such as boys and sheep, Illyrio warns him not to say these things to Khal\\n\\nDrogo, creating a flare of anger in Viserys’ eyes.\\nThe three of them journey in Illyrio\\'s litter to Khal Drogo\\'s manse in the pitch dark. Viserys states that ten thousand\\nDothraki “screamers” will be enough to overthrow \\nthe usurper\\n when combined with those in \\nWesteros\\n that are\\nawaiting his return. He speculates on those who would join their cause: \\nHouse Tyrell\\n, \\nHouse Redwyne\\n, \\nHouse\\nDarry\\n, \\nHouse Greyjoy\\n, and the \\nDornishmen\\n. Illyrio assures Viserys that the people in the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n secretly\\nawait his return, though Daenerys doubts him.\\nIllyrio says that Drogo’s mansion was a gift from the magisters of \\nPentos\\n, to help win Drogo\\'s friendship. They\\narrive at the mansion and are announced as King Viserys III and Princess Daenerys. Illyrio points out several\\nprominent guests, including Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n, who had fled the Seven Kingdoms under sentence of death several\\nyears before, and has since spent much time among the Dothraki. Illyrio then points out Khal Drogo himself, who is\\nas graceful as a panther, and younger than Daenerys had expected. Viserys notes his long braid, which means he has\\nnever been defeated in combat. Daenerys only notes his cold, hard face and is afraid of him. She asks to go home,\\nprovoking a rant from Viserys about how their \\nhome\\n has been taken away from them. Daenerys only meant their\\nrooms in Illyrio’s estate, but none of the places they have stayed in have been Viserys\\' home. Viserys also assures\\nDaenerys that he would let Khal Drogo\\'s whole \\nkhalasar\\n, including their horses, rape her if it would win him back\\nthe Seven Kingdoms. He then tells her to stop crying, because Illyrio is leading Khal Drogo over to meet them.\\nDaenerys stops crying, stands up straight, and smiles.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn I\\n ←\\nDaenerys I\\n→ \\nEddard 1\\n↓\\nDaenerys II\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 4: Eddard I\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys I\\n ←\\nEddard I\\n→ \\nJon I\\n↓\\nEddard II\\nKing \\nRobert I Baratheon\\n arrives with his party at \\nWinterfell\\n, where he offers Lord \\nEddard Stark\\n the position of\\nHand of the King\\n and proposes a betrothal between Eddard\\'s daughter \\nSansa\\n and his own son, crown prince \\nJoffrey\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nThe king\\'s party, three hundred strong, rides into \\nWinterfell\\n. Eddard recognizes \\nJaime Lannister\\n, \\nTyrion Lannister\\n,\\nCrown Prince \\nJoffrey Baratheon\\n, and \\nSandor Clegane\\n, but doesn\\'t recognize his old friend King \\nRobert\\n until Robert\\ncalls out. Eddard is shocked to see that Robert has gained 8 stone (112 lbs) since they last saw each other nine years\\nago during the \\nGreyjoy Rebellion\\n. Eddard pays obeisance as Queen \\nCersei\\n and the younger children debark from the\\nwheelhouse. After the formalities of greeting, including the introduction of children from both parties, Robert insists\\non being taken down to the crypts where the dead of \\nHouse Stark\\n are buried, so he can pay his respects to Eddard\\'s\\nsister\\n. Queen Cersei objects, but is disregarded by Robert, and quietly led away by her twin brother.\\nNed asks Robert about his journey and Robert complains of the distance that has to be traveled in the vast emptiness\\nof \\nthe North\\n. Robert then describes the advantages of living in the south, telling Ned he has to see the wonders, the\\nwarmth, and the undress of the women.\\nThey descend into the crypt, which is an effort for the out-of-shape Robert. Robert wants to visit the tomb of Ned\\'s\\nsister \\nLyanna Stark\\n, who was his betrothed. They pass the dead of House Stark with statues in front of the crypts,\\neach lord holding a sword on his lap with a \\ndirewolf\\n at his feet. They arrive at the last of the occupied crypts. Here\\nthere are three tombs for Ned’s father \\nLord Rickard\\n, his elder brother \\nBrandon\\n, and his sister Lyanna. Robert\\ndeclares that Ned should have buried Lyanna on a sunny hillside, but Ned explains that she was a Stark of Winterfell\\nand belongs here as was her wish. Ned remembers her dying, with only he and his friend \\nHowland Reed\\n nearby,\\nwhile Robert recalls taking his vengeance on \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n for what he did to Lyanna, regretting that he only\\ngot to kill him once. Ned suggests that they should return to the surface where Robert\\'s wife will be waiting. Robert\\nreplies that the \\nOthers\\n can take his wife, but they start back all the same.\\nAs they return, Ned asks about \\nJon Arryn\\n and Robert declares that he has never seen a man die so quickly: from\\nhealthy to dead within a fortnight. Ned asks how Jon\\'s widow \\nLysa\\n is bearing her grief, explaining that \\nCatelyn\\n fears\\nfor her sister. Robert confides that he thinks Jon’s death has driven Lysa mad and that she has taken \\nher son\\n back to\\nthe \\nEyrie\\n. Robert had hoped to foster the sickly boy with \\nTywin Lannister\\n, but Lysa refused to hear of it and left in\\nthe dead of night; Cersei was furious. Ned, who does not trust Tywin, is relieved. Ned asks to foster Robert Arryn\\nhimself, but Tywin has already agreed and Ned taking him as a ward would be an insult to Tywin.\\nNed comments that Robert should visit \\nthe Wall\\n, but Robert responds that he has more important concerns such as\\nreplacing Lord Arryn, who held several important positions such as \\nWarden of the East\\n. Ned reminds Robert that\\nthat title traditionally goes with the domain of \\nHouse Arryn\\n but Robert declares that he will not appoint six-year-old\\nRobert Arryn as \\nWarden of the East\\n. Ned reminds Robert that during times of peace the title is only an honor. The\\nking is not pleased--the son is not the father, though maybe when the boy is grown the title will be given back.\\nRobert mentions that he also needs a new \\nHand of the King\\n and offers the position to Ned so they can work together\\nagain. Then Robert tells Ned how the responsibilities bore him and complains that he is surrounded by flatterers and\\nfools. He insists that he wants Ned to come south to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n to be Hand of the King, the second most\\nimportant man in the kingdom.\\n\\nNed does not want the position and tries to declare himself unworthy of the honor. Robert only jokes that he is not\\ntrying to honor Ned but to get him to run the kingdom for him, relating the low-born saying that “the King eats and\\nthe Hand takes the shit.” Robert asks for at least a smile, but Ned replies that it is said to be so cold in the North that\\na man\\'s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death.\\nKing Robert also offers to marry his son, the Crown Prince Joffrey, to Ned\\'s eleven-year-old daughter \\nSansa Stark\\n to\\njoin the Houses of Stark and Baratheon as he and Lyanna were supposed to. Ned hesitates to make this decision,\\nwishing to speak to his wife, but Robert asks him not to take too long. Ned is filled with a sense of foreboding,\\nknowing that Winterfell is where he belongs, and that winter is coming.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys I\\n ←\\nEddard I\\n→ \\nJon I\\n↓\\nEddard II\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 5: Jon I\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard I\\n ←\\nJon I\\n→ \\nCatelyn II\\n↓\\nJon II\\nJon Snow\\n attends the feast Winterfell is holding for the royal guests and speaks with both \\nBenjen Stark\\n and \\nTyrion\\nLannister\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nA feast is held in \\nWinterfell\\n in honor of King \\nRobert\\n\\'s royal visit. Jon decides he is thankful his bastardy has\\nrelegated him to the far end of the hall with the younger squires instead of the king\\'s family. Here he can drink as\\nmuch as he wants (he has a man’s thirst) and mingle freely with those around him.\\nJon watches the king and his family as they arrive. He recognizes Queen \\nCersei\\n\\'s false smile and is disappointed\\nwith fat, red-faced King Robert. The 8-year-old Princess \\nMyrcella\\n seems smitten with her escort \\nRobb\\n, leading Jon\\nto decide she is insipid. \\nArya\\n is escorted by plump, young Prince \\nTommen\\n. The 12-year-old Crown Prince \\nJoffrey\\n(who is even taller than Robb) is escorting the radiant \\nSansa\\n. Jon decides he does not like Joffrey’s pouty lips or the\\ndisdain the prince seems to hold for Winterfell. He also notes that the queen\\'s brother \\nJaime Lannister\\n looks like a\\nproper king, and that waddling dwarf \\nTyrion Lannister\\n is grotesquely fascinating, as ugly as Jaime and Cersei are\\nbeautiful. The last to enter are \\nBenjen Stark\\n and \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n.\\nJon feeds his \\ndirewolf\\n \\nGhost\\n under the table and watches the pup silently face down a full-grown dog three times his\\nsize. Bringing his wolf to the feast is another perk to being the bastard. Jon is soon joined by his uncle Benjen, who\\nasks Jon how much he\\'s had to drink, adding that Jon is older than he was when he first got truly drunk. Benjen asks\\nabout Ghost and Jon explains that he named him Ghost for his white color and because he never makes a sound.\\nBenjen then asks why Jon is not at the main table and Jon says flatly that Lady \\nCatelyn\\n thought seating a bastard\\nwith the king might give offense.\\nBenjen comments that \\nEddard\\n does not seem festive and Jon adds that neither does the queen, probably because of\\nKing Robert\\'s visit to the crypts. Benjen commends Jon\\'s keen observation and remarks that he could use a man like\\nhim on \\nthe Wall\\n. Jon asks if he can return to the Wall with Benjen. Benjen replies that the Wall is a hard place for a\\nboy, but Jon counters that he will turn 15 on his next name day and it\\'s said bastards grow up faster than purebloods.\\nJon thinks about how all his half brothers and sisters have futures, but there is no future for a bastard. Benjen says\\nthat he should know a woman and father a bastard or two first, to know what he will be giving up. This angers Jon,\\nwho states that he will \\nnever\\n father a bastard and runs off with Ghost at his heels before anyone can see him cry.\\nAs Jon is leaving, Tyrion Lannister speaks to him from a ledge in the deserted yard and asks if he can take a look at\\nGhost. Jon offers to help him down, but Tyrion jumps down, acrobatically landing on his hands and vaulting to his\\nfeet. Ghost is uncertain about Tyrion, but submits to examination at Jon\\'s command. Tyrion asks if Jon is Eddard\\'s\\nbastard. Jon bridles and Tyrion apologizes that as a dwarf he can usually speak as he pleases, like a jester. He\\ncomments that Jon seems to have more of \\nthe North\\n in him than his half-siblings. Tyrion advises Jon never to forget\\nwho and what he is so that no one can use it against him. When Jon questions what Tyrion would know about being\\na bastard, Tyrion replies that all dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes and that, although all dwarfs are bastards,\\nnot all bastards need to be dwarfs.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard I\\n ←\\nJon I\\n→ \\nCatelyn II\\n↓\\n\\nJon II\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 6: Catelyn II\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn I\\n↑\\nJon I\\n ←\\nCatelyn II\\n→ \\nArya I\\n↓\\nCatelyn III\\nA secret letter from \\nher sister\\n leads \\nCatelyn\\n to convince \\nNed\\n to go to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n and become the \\nHand of the\\nKing\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n and \\nCatelyn\\n are in Catelyn\\'s bedchamber after making love. Uncomfortable with the warmth of the room, which\\nis heated by hot springs beneath the castle, Ned opens the windows. As she watches him from the bed, Catelyn\\nthinks he looks the same as when she married him and hopes they have conceived another child.\\nThe couple discuss King \\nRobert\\n\\'s offer, which Ned intends to refuse. Catelyn insists that he must accept so as not to\\noffend the king, which might put them all in danger. While Catelyn contemplates the omen of the \\ndirewolf\\n killed by\\na \\nstag\\n, Ned wishes his brother \\nBrandon\\n had lived to be Lord of Winterfell instead.\\nThey are interrupted by a guardsman named \\nDesmond\\n, who says that \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n has an urgent message. The\\nmaester is shown in and explains that a carved wooden box containing a fine new glass lens was left in his\\nobservatory while he was napping. The way it was delivered made the maester wonder and he discovered a message\\nhidden beneath a false bottom. Maester Luwin says he has not read it, and will not give it to Ned because it is\\naddressed to Catelyn.\\nCatelyn takes the message apprehensively. It is from her sister \\nLysa\\n and written in a secret language only the two\\nsisters share. Catelyn immediately burns the message after reading it, but explains to Ned that the message claims\\nJon Arryn\\n was murdered by Queen \\nCersei\\n and her \\nfamily\\n. Catelyn insists that now Ned \\nmust\\n be the \\nHand of the\\nKing\\n, to find the truth behind Lysa\\'s accusations. Maester Luwin agrees with Catelyn, pointing out that the Hand\\'s\\nauthority will help determine the truth and protect Lysa and \\nher son\\n. Ned reminds them both that \\nhis father\\n went\\nsouth once at the summons of a king and never returned. Luwin replies that that was a different time and a different\\nking. Catelyn insist that if Ned truly loves King Robert like a brother, he will not leave him to face the Lannisters on\\nhis own.\\nNed then makes his decision: he will go, but Catelyn must stay behind to govern Winterfell and teach his heir \\nRobb\\nhow to be a proper lord. He allows that young \\nRickon\\n may stay with her as well, but the others must come south--\\nSansa\\n to wed \\nJoffrey\\n, and \\nArya\\n to learn the ways of a southern court. Catelyn reluctantly agrees, but begs that seven-\\nyear-old \\nBran\\n be allowed to stay. Ned insists that Bran must bridge the gap between Robb and Joffrey. The house\\nwill be the safer for it, and Catelyn has to agree. Catelyn feels lonely already.\\nMaester Luwin asks about \\nJon Snow\\n and Catelyn\\'s anger flashes. She remembers the bastard child that Ned brought\\nback with him in the early days of their marriage. She understood Ned fathering a bastard son, but could not\\nunderstand raising a bastard in the castle. There were rumors that \\nAshara Dayne\\n was the boy\\'s mother, but Ned\\nforbade Catelyn to ask about it, insisting that all she needed to know was that Jon was his blood. Ned would never\\nsend Jon away though, and Catelyn could never forgive him that. Catelyn insists that Jon must leave Winterfell, but\\nNed argues that there will be no place for Jon at court. Maester Luwin mentions Jon\\'s ambitions to join the \\nNight\\'s\\nWatch\\n. Ned considers this for a while and finally agrees to let Jon take the black, though not until they are ready to\\nleave for the south; he wants Jon to enjoy his last few days. Ned decides that when it is time, he will tell Jon himself.\\n\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn I\\n↑\\nJon I\\n ←\\nCatelyn II\\n→ \\nArya I\\n↓\\nCatelyn III\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 7: Arya I\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn II\\n ←\\nArya I\\n→ \\nBran II\\n↓\\nArya II\\nArya\\n runs out on her needlework session to watch the boys practice with swords in the yard.\\nSynopsis\\nArya\\n is dismayed at her crooked stitches; she can\\'t match her sister \\nSansa\\n\\'s needlework. Their governess, \\nSepta\\nMordane\\n, coos over Princess \\nMyrcella\\n\\'s needlework, which Arya thinks is also crooked. Sansa is whispering with\\nJeyne Poole\\n and \\nBeth Cassel\\n. When Arya asks what they are whispering about she is told it is about how handsome\\nPrince Joffrey is, and that he has complimented Sansa and is going to marry her. Arya points out that \\nJon Snow\\nthinks Joffrey looks like a girl. Sansa laments that Jon gets jealous because he is a \\nbastard\\n but Arya defends him,\\ndrawing the septa\\'s attention to her.\\nSepta Mordane inspects Arya\\'s stitches and pronounces her dissatisfaction. Humiliated, Arya bolts for the door,\\nstopping only long enough to be forced to bow to Princess Myrcella. Arya wishes she had some of her sister\\'s skill\\nand beauty. She has her father’s looks, not the beauty of their mother like Sansa. Jeyne used to call her \"Horseface\",\\nwhich was all the more hurtful because the only thing that Arya could do better than Sansa was ride. That and\\nmanage a household since Sansa has no head for figures.\\nArya finds her direwolf pup \\nNymeria\\n waiting for her and together they go to watch the boys sparring in the practice\\nyard, not daring to go back to her room where she would be found and punished. On the covered bridge overlooking\\nthe yard, Arya comes across Jon Snow seated on a sill with \\nGhost\\n, watching the fighting below. She sits down\\nbeside him and they watch together.\\nIn the yard below, heavily-padded \\nBran\\n and Prince \\nTommen\\n are fighting each other with wooden swords under the\\nwatchful eye of Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n, the master-at-arms. The group of spectators includes \\nRobb\\n and \\nTheon\\n. Jon\\ncomments that swords are a bit more exhausting than needlework, but Arya responds that they are also more fun.\\nArya remembers thinking when she was little that she was a bastard like Jon because they were the only children to\\ntake after their father. When Arya asks why Jon is not down in the yard with the others, Jon explains that bastards\\nare not allowed to damage princes, only trueborn swords can do that. Arya says she could fight as well as Bran who\\nis only seven while she is nine, but Jon says she doesn\\'t have enough strength for a longsword.\\nJon points out that the newly-arrived Prince \\nJoffery\\n is wearing a sigil that has both the stag and lion on it, giving his\\nmother\\n’s \\nLannister\\n sigil equality to the royal \\nBaratheon\\n sigil. Jon suggests that Arya should wear a combination sigil\\nfor the \\nStarks\\n and \\nTullys\\n, but Arya jokes that a wolf with a trout in its mouth would look silly. She questions why a\\ngirl would need a sigil if she isn\\'t allowed to fight. Jon shrugs that girls get the sigils but not the swords, while\\nbastards get the swords but not the sigils.\\nBelow, Bran has knocked Tommen down and Ser Rodrik calls Robb and Joffrey for a bout. Joffrey acts as if it is\\nbeneath his dignity to fight Starks with practice swords. He suggests real swords and Robb readily accepts. Jon\\ncomments to Arya that Joffrey truly is a \"little shit\". Ser Rodrik states that he will only allow blunted tourney\\nswords. Joffrey\\'s scarred bodyguard \\nSandor Clegane\\n remarks that he killed a man with a real sword when he was\\nonly twelve. Joffrey makes a few more condescending remarks that enrage Robb, then feigns a yawn and leaves\\nwith Tommen. Jon encourages Arya to go to her room and face her punishment. Arya insists it is not fair, but Jon\\nsays that nothing is fair as he walks away with Ghost.

He\\nremembers the stories \\nOld Nan\\n told about ghosts, terrible dungeons, and dragon skulls on the walls. He dreams of\\nbeing a member of the \\nKingsguard\\n someday and is anxious to meet the greatest living knight, Ser \\nBarristan the Bold\\n.\\nBut now Bran is also apprehensive about leaving the only home he has ever known. He will miss all those he is\\nleaving behind, even his pony.\\nNot being able to stand the goodbyes, Bran goes to the castle \\ngodswood\\n with his \\ndirewolf\\n. Unlike all his siblings, he\\nstill hasn’t named his wolf; none of the names he tries seem right. Eventually, Bran gets tired of trying to teach his\\nwolf to fetch and decides to go climbing. His wolf doesn’t want him to go and howls when he climbs away up a tree\\nand onto the armory roof.\\nBran spends much of his time climbing the roofs of Winterfell. His \\nmother\\n claims that he could climb before he\\ncould walk. Since Bran cannot remember learning to climb or learning to walk he assumes it must be true. His\\nmother is also terrified that one day he might fall and kill himself. Once Bran kept a promise not to climb for almost\\na fortnight and was miserable the entire time. Finally he gave in, but confessed his crime the next day. When his\\nfather\\n ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself, they found him sleeping in the tallest tree in the grove the\\nnext morning. His father, angry and laughing, told him that from now on he was free to climb, so long as his mother\\ndidn’t catch him.\\nOthers have tried to stop him, but to no avail. The guards tried to stop him, but they were too slow and escaping\\nfrom them was fun. Old Nan once told a story of a boy who climbed too high and was struck by lightning and had\\nhis eyes eaten by crows, but Bran likes to feed the crows and they never seem interested in eating his eyes. \\nMaester\\nLuwin\\n made a clay boy and threw it off the wall as an example, but Bran only responded that he is not made of clay\\nand he never falls.\\nBran is climbing toward the Broken Tower, where he likes to feed the crows, when he is startled by voices from the\\nFirst Keep, the oldest part of the castle. At first he doesn’t recognize them as Queen \\nCersei\\n and her brother, Ser\\nJaime\\n. Cersei is telling Jaime that he should be the \\nHand of the King\\n and that Eddard Stark will put them in danger\\nbecause the king loves him like a brother. Jaime jokes that Robert hates his brothers. Unamused, Cersei insists that\\nRobert will listen to Eddard. Jaime states that he prefers honorable men to ambitious men like Robert’s brothers and\\nLittlefinger\\n.\\nCersei says she is worried about what \\nLysa Arryn\\n may have said to the Starks, but Jaime tells her not to worry, as\\n\\nLysa has no proof. Despite this, Cersei remains fearful that Eddard might betray her son \\nJoffrey\\n when he takes the\\nthrone or convince Robert to put her aside.\\nBran grows frightened by what he overhears but wants to see who is talking, so he climbs over the window, then\\ndrops down. He can see the man and woman inside, naked and wrestling, fondling, and moaning. He recognizes\\nCersei just as her eyes open and she sees him. Bran loses his grip as he tries to escape, but he catches himself on the\\nwindow ledge. Cersei and Jaime come to look at him. Jaime extends a hand to Bran and pulls him up onto the ledge.\\nAs Bran begins to relax, Jaime asks him how old he is. Bran tells him he is seven. Then Jaime loathingly says, “The\\nthings I do for love,” and shoves Bran backwards out the window into the empty air.\\nNavigation:\\nBran I\\n↑\\nArya I\\n ←\\nBran II\\n→ \\nTyrion I\\n↓\\nBran III\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 9: Tyrion I\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran II\\n ←\\nTyrion I\\n→ \\nJon II\\n↓\\nTyrion II\\nTyrion\\n meets up with his nephew \\nJoffrey\\n and insists he pay his sympathies to the Starks, before joining his \\nbrother\\nand \\nsister\\n for breakfast with news that \\nBran Stark\\n will probably survive.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n has been reading all night in Winterfell\\'s library when he hears a wolf howl.

As he leaves,\\nTyrion hears \\nSandor Clegane\\n complaining about how long \\nBran Stark\\n is taking to die. \\nPrince Joffrey\\n states that at\\nleast Bran is dying quietly, but the wolf\\'s howling is disturbing his sleep. The Hound offers to go kill it, which\\nJoffrey finds amusing, believing the \\nStarks\\n would not notice it missing. Tyrion notes that the Starks can count past\\nsix, unlike some princes.\\nThe Hound uses the remark as an excuse to make fun of Tyrion\\'s height. Tyrion brushes the comment off before\\nadvising Joffrey to pay a visit to the Starks to offer his sympathies. When Joffrey asks what good it would do,\\nTyrion tells him that his absence has been noticed. Joffrey continues to refuse, but Tyrion proceeds to browbeat him\\nto the edge of tears until the boy acquiesces. The Hound, looming over Tyrion, warns him that the prince will\\nremember how his uncle slapped him. Tyrion responds that he hopes he does and that the Hound should be a good\\ndog and remind Joffrey if he forgets it.\\nTyrion then seeks out his \\nbrother\\n and \\nsister\\n, who are having breakfast in the morning room of the guest house. He\\nasks if \\nKing Robert\\n is still in bed and Cersei disdainfully explains that Robert has been up all night with Lord\\nEddard\\n and has taken the Starks\\' sorrow deeply to heart. When Jaime adds that Robert has a big heart, Tyrion\\nremembers that during his childhood Jaime was the only person who ever showed him any affection or respect. In\\nreturn, Tyrion is willing to forgive Jaime almost anything.\\nAs Tyrion orders breakfast, \\nPrince Tommen\\n asks after Bran and says he doesn\\'t want him to die.

As he speaks, Tyrion catches the significant glance between Jaime and Cersei. Cersei\\nimmediately insists it is no mercy for Bran to live. When \\nMyrcella\\n asks if Bran will be alright, Tyrion replies that\\nBran will never walk again. Tyrion goes on to say that the \\nwolf\\n howling outside his window may be contributing to\\nBran\\'s survival: when the window is closed Bran gets weaker, but his heart strengthens again when it is open. Cersei\\nresponds that the wolves disturb her and are dangerous, but Jaime tells her the girls\\' wolves will doubtless follow\\nthem to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n.\\nTyrion then reveals to his family that he intends to visit \\nthe Wall\\n before returning south.

The Dothraki are eating everything in sight, and Illyrio thinks it would be best to have\\nthe marriage as soon as possible. Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n has offered and been accepted into the service of Daenerys\\'\\nbrother \\nViserys\\n. Viserys is impatient for \\nDrogo\\n to help him regain his throne. Illyrio explains to him that the \\nKhal\\nmust take his new bride to \\nVaes Dothrak\\n first, and then wait until the omens are favorable for war. Viserys\\ncomplains at the delay despite Illyrio and Jorah cautioning patience.\\nThat night, Daenerys dreams of Viserys chasing and beating her and saying, \"You woke the dragon.\" Then she turns\\nto see a dragon in his place and wakes shaking with a fine sheen of sweat on her skin.\\nDaenerys weds Khal Drogo under the open sky, before forty thousand Dothraki warriors. The ceremonies begin at\\ndawn and continue until dusk. Viserys, Illyrio, and Jorah are seated below Drogo and Daenerys at the feast, which\\ngrates on Viserys\\' pride, especially when food is first served to Daenerys and Drogo before being offered to him.\\nDaenerys, with the forced smile her brother told her she should wear, eats little since her stomach is upset. She is\\nseated only with her new husband, and they do not even share a common language, so there is nothing for her to do.\\nEarly on in the day she sees Dothraki men taking dancing women and mounting them in the open like animals.\\nWhen two men grab the same woman, a fight to the death ensues. The survivor then takes another woman. Illyrio\\nhas told her that a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered dull; by the end of the day a dozen\\nmen have died, obviously making it an exceptional wedding. Daenerys is consumed by fear of her hulking husband\\nwith a stern cruel face and a culture that is so different, and of her brother if she should fail him.\\nAs the sun sets, Daenerys receives her bride gifts. Viserys gives her three hand maids that cost him nothing, picked\\nto teach her what she needs to know: \\nIrri\\n (to teach her how to ride), \\nJhiqui\\n (to teach her the Dothraki tongue) and\\nDoreah\\n (to teach her the arts of love). Ser Jorah, with an apology since it was all he could afford, gives her a stack of\\nold books in the \\nCommon Tongue\\n, and she thanks him with all her heart. Illyrio gives her fine silks and fabrics, and\\nthree huge \\ndragon\\n\\'s eggs: one is green, one is cream-colored, and one is black with scarlet ripples and swirls. Illyrio\\ntells her that they have turned to stone over the years. Khal Drogo\\'s \\nbloodriders\\n give her the traditional three\\nweapons, which she refuses with the traditional refusals and passes to her husband. Many other gifts come from the\\nother Dothraki.\\nLast of all Drogo brings forward his own bride gift, a fine grey \\nfilly\\n. Drogo easily lifts her by the waist up to the\\nsaddle. She does not know what to do. Ser Jorah tells her to take the reins and ride. She is only a fair rider, having\\ntraveled almost exclusively by other means, but as she rides, she forgets her fears and eventually sends the horse into\\na gallop, and even has it leap over a firepit. She returns and tells Illyrio to tell her husband that he has given her the\\nwind, and Drogo smiles. Then the sun sets and Drogo readies his horse. When Viserys warns her to please her\\n\\nhusband, lest she will regret it, fear comes back to her.\\nDrogo sets a fast pace, saying nothing. Daenerys tries to rid herself of her fear by remembering she is the blood of\\nthe dragon and the dragon is never afraid. It is full dark when they stop at a grassy place beside a small stream.\\nDrogo swings off his horse and lifts her down from hers. She feels fragile in her wedding silks. She begins to weep,\\nbut Drogo says \"No,\" and wipes her tears away. She asks questions but all Drogo says is “No.” He starts softly\\nmurmuring to her in Dothraki to soothe her. Drogo sets her down on a rock and sits facing her, then starts removing\\nthe bells from his hair, and Daenerys helps. Then he indicates that she should unbraid his hair, which takes a long\\ntime. Then Drogo undresses her, with tenderness, and caresses her until she is ready for him. When he bares her\\nbreasts, she covers herself with her hands but Drogo gently pulls her hands away. After he finishes undressing her,\\nhe watches her for a while. Then he begins to touch her face and hair. It seems like hours to Daenerys before his\\nhands go to her breasts. This makes Daenerys breathless, and when he seats her on his lap and asks “No?” she\\nmoves his hand inside her and says “Yes.”\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys I\\n↑\\nJon II\\n ←\\nDaenerys II\\n→ \\nEddard II\\n↓\\nDaenerys III\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 12: Eddard II\\nPlace(s): \\nBarrowlands\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard I\\n↑\\nDaenerys II\\n ←\\nEddard II\\n→ \\nTyrion II\\n↓\\nEddard III\\nNed\\n and King \\nRobert\\n discuss the threat posed by \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n\\'s marriage and the events surrounding the\\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n is woken before dawn to find his horse saddled and King \\nRobert\\n waiting.

When Robert explains that the information has\\ncome from Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n, Ned takes offense, recalling Mormont as a fugitive who fled the King’s justice after\\nselling some poachers to a \\nTyroshi\\n slaver in defiance of the law.\\nThe news of the wedding does not worry Ned, but when Robert angrily suggests an assassination attempt he is not\\nsurprised. Since the days of the \\nrebellion\\n, Robert has held a hatred for the \\nTargaryens\\n that seems a madness to Ned.\\nNed recalls the angry words that passed between Robert and himself when \\nTywin Lannister\\n presented Robert with\\nthe corpses of \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n’s wife \\nElia\\n and children \\nAegon\\n and \\nRhaenys\\n as tokens of fealty.

Robert replies that ships can be found in the \\nFree Cities\\n and that many in the \\nSeven\\nKingdoms\\n—particularly in \\nDorne\\n and \\nthe Reach\\n—would not hesitate to join a Targaryen invasion. Despite this, Ned\\nremains convinced that they would be able to drive the Dothraki back, emphasizing the importance of appointing a\\nnew \\nWarden of the East\\n. When Robert refuses to appoint \\nJon Arryn\\n’s son \\nRobert\\n, Ned suggests the king’s own\\nbrother, \\nStannis\\n. When Robert continues to be evasive, Ned quickly deduces that he has already promised the office\\nto \\nJaime Lannister\\n. Ned reminds Robert that Jaime already stands to succeed Tywin Lannister as \\nWarden of the\\nWest\\n and that as Warden of both East and West, Jaime would control half of all the realm’s armies.\\n\\nNed asks whether Jaime can be trusted. When Robert asks why he shouldn’t trust Jaime, Ned reminds him that\\nJaime betrayed and killed the last king he was sworn to protect. To illustrate his point about Jaime Lannister, Ned\\ndescribes to Robert how, after the \\nBattle of the Trident\\n, he followed Rhaegar\\'s army back to King\\'s Landing to find\\nthe city \\nsacked\\n by the Lannisters. Ned goes on to explain that upon entering the throne room, he found King Aerys\\ndead on the floor and Jaime sitting on the \\nIron Throne\\n. Although Jaime eventually rose to say that he was only\\nkeeping the uncomfortable thing warm for Robert, Ned insists that Jaime had no right to sit the throne.\\nRobert finds this amusing and does not consider Jaime\\'s \"great sin\" to be that bad. He gallops off but Ned pauses,\\ndespairing of ever keeping Robert from making mistakes. He still believes he should be in Winterfell with his wife\\nand \\nBran\\n. Finally, resigned to not being able to be where he belongs, Ned follows his king.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard I\\n↑\\nDaenerys II\\n ←\\nEddard II\\n→ \\nTyrion II\\n↓\\nEddard III\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 13: Tyrion II\\nPlace(s): \\nNorth of \\nWinterfell\\n on the way to \\nCastle Black\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion I\\n↑\\nEddard II\\n ←\\nTyrion II\\n→ \\nCatelyn III\\n↓\\nTyrion III\\nAs they travel north \\nTyrion\\n and \\nJon Snow\\n argue about the realities of life on the \\nWall\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nAfter a fortnight riding north from \\nWinterfell\\n with \\nBenjen Stark\\n, \\nJon Snow\\n, and two of his own retainers, \\nTyrion\\n is\\namazed by the enormous size of \\nthe North\\n. Although he knows the maps of the region as well as anyone, the land\\nitself is quite another thing. It has grown colder, quieter, and far lonelier the farther north they go and the Kingsroad\\nhas narrowed to a wild track.\\nThree days out of Winterfell the farmland has given way to the dense, dark forests of the \\nWolfswood\\n. There they\\nmeet up with \\nYoren\\n, a brother of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n, accompanied by two peasant boys condemned to join the\\nWatch. That night Tyrion notices Jon Snow looking at their new companions with dismay and feels sorry for the boy\\nwho has had such a hard life chosen for him. Tyrion feels less sympathy for Benjen Stark, who apparently shares his\\nbrother\\n’s distaste for Lannisters and seems intent on making Tyrion’s journey north as uncomfortable as possible.\\nHowever, Tyrion does take a small bit of revenge when he accepts a tattered old bearskin cloak from Benjen, a gift\\nTyrion thinks Benjen did not expect him to accept and is probably regretting.\\nBy the eighteenth night of their journey the inns and settlements have long since disappeared, forcing the party to\\nmake camp. Being too small to help, Tyrion (as is his custom) goes away from the camp with a book about \\ndragons\\n,\\none of several brought with him from Winterfell. Tyrion has always been interested in dragons. He remembers\\nseeking out the dragon skulls in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n the first time he was there. He recalls having a torch with him when\\nhe discovered the skulls and having the sensation that they seemed to like it when he put his torch to them. There\\nwere three skulls much larger than the others and one of the skulls could have swallowed a mammoth whole. Tyrion\\nrecalls that King \\nLoren I\\n, an ancestor of the \\nLannisters\\n, had been about to defeat \\nAegon I Targaryen\\n in battle when\\nthe Targaryens \\nunleashed\\n all three of their dragons and made short work of their opponents.\\nAs Tyrion reads he is approached by Jon Snow, who asks why he reads so much. Tyrion explains that because his\\nbody is twisted and weak he must rely on his mind and that a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.\\nWhen Jon asks what Tyrion is reading, Tyrion begins to explain about dragons and how he fantasized about them as\\na child when feeling resentful toward his family.\\nWhen Tyrion goes so far as to suggest that Jon must feel resentment towards his own family, Jon protests. However\\nTyrion continues to push the issue, sarcastically describing how Lady \\nCatelyn\\n treats him as one of her own, how\\nRobb\\n is kind because he is the heir, and how Eddard Stark must have had a good reason to pack Jon off to the \\nWall\\n.\\nWhen Jon replies that the Night’s Watch is a noble calling, Tyrion describes the Watch as a midden heap for the\\nrealm’s debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards, all kept busy watching for imaginary \\ngrumkins\\n and \\nsnarks\\n.\\nWhen Jon asks him to stop, Tyrion realizes what he has been saying and feels badly. Reaching out to comfort Jon,\\nhe is attacked and knocked down by Jon’s \\ndirewolf\\n, \\nGhost\\n. Unable to get up on his own, Tyrion is forced to\\napologize to Jon before receiving help. When Tyrion questions why the wolf attacked, Jon jokes that Ghost must\\nhave mistaken Tyrion for a grumkin, which amuses them both.\\n\\nHaving calmed down, Jon asks Tyrion if the things he said of the Night’s Watch were true. When Tyrion says yes,\\nJon accepts the truth grimly. The two share some wine and return to camp for a supper of squirrel stew. Tyrion is the\\nlast to retire, and Jon has the first watch.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion I\\n↑\\nEddard II\\n ←\\nTyrion II\\n→ \\nCatelyn III\\n↓\\nTyrion III\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 14: Catelyn III\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn II\\n↑\\nTyrion II\\n ←\\nCatelyn III\\n→ \\nSansa I\\n↓\\nCatelyn IV\\nCatelyn\\n\\'s breakdown over \\nBran\\'s\\n fall ends when an attempt is made on Bran\\'s life.

Regardless, the maester continues to speak of replacing provisions. Catelyn insists that the\\nsteward can worry about such matters.

Catelyn insists she can\\'t bear to be away from Bran, in case he should die.\\nRobb assures her that Bran is not going to die and reminds her that her other children need her, too. He goes on to\\nexplain that \\nRickon\\n just follows him around all day crying, thinking everyone has abandoned him.\\nRobb hears a \\ndirewolf\\n howling outside and opens the window, explaining that the sound seems to be good for Bran.\\nWhen the other direwolves join in, Catelyn screams for Robb to make the noise stop and then collapses to the floor.\\nRobb helps her up but she only begins screaming again. Then Robb notices the dogs barking as well and sees the\\nlibrary tower afire.\\nWhile Robb rushes off to fight the fire, Catelyn remains behind with Bran. When she turns away from the window,\\nhowever, she is face-to-face with \\na filthy man\\n brandishing \\na knife\\n. The man claims that Catelyn was not supposed to\\nbe there and moves towards Bran, claiming that killing him would be a mercy. Catelyn attempts to scream for help,\\nbut the man is too quick as he moves to slit her throat. Catelyn manages to grab the blade with her hands and push it\\naway, cutting her fingers badly. She bites the man\\'s hand and fights her way free. The man is about to attack her\\nagain when Bran\\'s direwolf leaps onto him and rips out his throat.

She wakes up four days later. It seems like a\\nnightmare, but the pain in her hands reminds her that it was real.

Where the man had been hiding they found ninety \\nsilver stags\\n hidden under the straw.\\nWhen Robb asks why anybody would want to kill Bran, Catelyn insists that as a \\nlord\\n he must learn to answer his\\nown questions. Robb guesses that somebody is afraid of what Bran might do or say if he wakes up and so posts a\\n\\nheavy guard on Bran.\\nRodrik points out that the dagger used by the assassin, a \\nValyrian steel\\n blade with a \\ndragonbone\\n handle, is a much\\nfiner weapon than anything the low-born footpad should have possessed; someone must have given it to him.\\nCatelyn then tells Rodrik, Theon, and Robb in strict confidence of her sister \\nLysa\\'s\\n suspicions about the death of \\nJon\\nArryn\\n. She reminds them that \\nJaime Lannister\\n did not go hunting with the others the day Bran fell, and that she does\\nnot believe that Bran fell, but that he was pushed.

Near the \\nruby ford\\n, they come\\nupon \\nArya Stark\\n and a \\nbutcher\\'s boy\\n play-fighting. Joffrey begins to torment the boy until Arya attacks him.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa\\n is having breakfast with \\nSepta\\n \\nMordane\\n in an \\ninn\\n near the \\nTrident\\n. When Sansa feeds her \\ndirewolf\\n \\nLady\\n under\\nthe table, the septa says that although Sansa is a good girl she is as willful as her sister Arya when it comes to her\\ndirewolf.\\nThe septa informs Sansa that they have been invited to ride in the wheelhouse with Queen \\nCersei\\n and Princess\\nMyrcella\\n. Sansa has been looking forward to this for a week, hoping for a chance to be with Prince \\nJoffrey\\n. Joffrey\\nis everything she ever wanted her prince to be like: tall and strong and handsome. The one thing Sansa is afraid of is\\nthat Arya will ruin everything for her. Septa Mordane wants Sansa and Arya to dress well for the event and Sansa\\nhas already decided on a fine silk dress. She does not expect Arya to wear anything appropriate. Sansa begs to be\\nexcused so she can look for Arya.\\nShe finds Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to comb the mud out of her direwolf \\nNymeria\\n\\'s fur. Arya is not\\ninterested in riding in the wheelhouse, and intends to go riding with \\nMycah\\n to look for \\nrubies\\n in the river. Sansa\\ninsists that there is no fun in riding because there is nothing to see, but Arya is fascinated by all the new flowers and\\nlandmarks and people they are seeing along the way. Sansa informs Arya that she has to come, asking why anyone\\nwould want to ride a stinky horse when they could ride in the wheelhouse on pillows while eating lemon cakes and\\nkeeping company with the queen. Arya replies that she does not even like the queen and still intends to go riding.\\nSansa, giving up, leaves but Arya yells after her that Lady will not be allowed in the wheelhouse, which leaves\\nSansa speechless.\\nWhen she nears the camp, Sansa sees a crowd gathered around the wheelhouse; the \\ncouncil\\n has sent an honor guard\\nfrom \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n to accompany them the rest of the way. The party includes two knights in fine armour: a strong\\nold man in white armor and a beautiful young man in green armor. There is also a gaunt, grim man that Sansa finds\\nso terrifying that she backs right into \\nSandor Clegane\\n. Sansa kneels and hugs Lady and, next thing she knows, the\\ntwo new arrivals are standing above her. Joffrey explains that the terrifying man is Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n, the King\\'s Justice\\n(the royal executioner).\\nThe white knight then introduces himself as Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n, Lord Commander of the \\nKingsguard\\n, but the green\\nknight insists that she guess. Based on his age and his antlered helm, Sansa correctly deduces him to be the king\\'s\\nyoungest brother, Lord \\nRenly Baratheon\\n. Feeling more comfortable, Sansa apologizes to Ser Ilyn Payne, but the\\nman does not speak. Once he has left, Joffrey explains that his tongue was ripped out by \\nMad King Aerys\\n.\\nThe Queen says that she must speak with the councilors, and therefore must postpone the day with Myrcella.\\nInstead, she asks Joffrey to entertain their guests—Sansa is overjoyed with the idea of a whole day with Joffrey.\\nSansa offers to do whatever the prince wants, and when Joffrey suggest they go riding, Sansa gushes that she loves\\nriding. Joffrey then suggests that it would be best to leave Lady and his dog, Sandor Clegane, behind. When Sansa\\nquestions leaving Clegane behind Joffrey brandishes his sword, \\nLion\\'s Tooth\\n.\\nThey ride along the river, exploring the countryside until they draw near to the \\nbattlefield\\n where King \\nRobert\\n\\ndefeated \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n. Then they hear an odd sound, like wooden clattering, coming from nearby. In a nearby\\nclearing, they find a boy and a girl play-fighting with sticks. The boy, taller and older than the girl, is winning.\\nWhen the girl is disarmed by a smack on the hand, Sansa recognizes her as Arya. Joffrey laughs and the boy, a\\nbutcher\\'s boy named \\nMycah\\n, drops his stick. Joffrey begins to taunt Mycah and challenges him to a fight, sword\\nagainst stick. Mycah insists that Arya asked him to fight her, which Sansa quickly realizes is the truth. Joffrey\\nremains oblivious however, and goes so far as to prick the boy\\'s cheek with his sword. Arya picks up her stick and\\ntells Joffrey to leave Mycah alone. Joffrey insists that he will not hurt Mycah, much.\\nWithout warning, Arya breaks her stick over the back of Joffrey\\'s head. Mycah runs away while an enraged Joffrey\\nstaggers but manages to catch a second blow from Arya on his sword, knocking the splintered stick from her hand.\\nIgnoring Sansa\\'s screams for them to stop, Arya throws a rock and hits Joffrey\\'s horse, driving it away. Joffrey\\nchases Arya with his sword until she is backed up against a tree. Suddenly Nymeria appears, savaging Joffrey\\'s\\nsword arm and forcing him to drop his sword. Arya calls Nymeria off and picks up Lion\\'s Tooth while Joffrey lies\\nwhimpering on the ground. The prince pleads to Arya not to hurt him.

He is dismayed to find the chamber full of people, preventing a private and amicable solution. Ned also\\nnotes that very few in the crowd are likely to be sympathetic to the Starks; most are either Lannister men or loyal to\\nthe local lord \\nRaymun Darry\\n, a prominent \\nTargaryen\\n loyalist who lost family and fortune at the \\nTrident\\n. However,\\nNed is relieved that neither \\nJaime Lannister\\n nor \\nSandor Clegane\\n are present.\\nArya apologizes to Ned profusely as she cries. Ned turns angrily to the king, demanding to know why Arya was not\\nbrought to him first. Queen Cersei bristles at his tone but Robert apologizes, explaining that he only wanted to finish\\nthe business quickly. Cersei then accuses Arya and \\nMycah\\n of ambushing Joffrey with clubs while setting \\nNymeria\\n to\\ntear off his arm. When Joffrey affirms this, Arya calls him a liar. After the king has listened to Arya’s side of the\\nstory, Lord \\nRenly\\n begins snickering and asks Joffrey how a skinny nine-year-old girl managed to disarm him with a\\nbroom handle. When Joffrey recounts a very different story, King Robert is exasperated.\\nNed reminds the king that \\nSansa\\n was also present and has Sansa brought in to testify. However, Sansa—torn\\nbetween her family and her love for Joffrey—claims she doesn’t remember. This infuriates Arya, who lunges at\\nSansa. Cersei uses this as an example of how wild Arya is, and insists she wants Arya punished. King Robert, even\\nmore exasperated, orders Ned to discipline Arya while he will discipline Joffrey. Unsatisfied, Cersei demands that\\nNymeria be killed and offers 100 gold dragons for her pelt. However, since Nymeria has disappeared, Cersei\\ndemands the skin of the other direwolf. When Ned protests, Robert only responds that a direwolf is not a pet and that\\nthe girl would be happier with a dog.\\nSansa finally realizes that they are talking about \\nher\\n \\ndirewolf\\n and goes crying to Ned. In a final attempt to save the\\ndirewolf, Ned insists that the king execute the wolf himself but Robert only walks away. Ned refuses to let \\nIlyn\\nPayne\\n do the task. When Cersei voices suspicion about Ned’s intentions, Ned replies that the direwolf is from \\nthe\\nNorth\\n and deserves better than a butcher.\\nWith Sansa’s cries in his ears, Ned goes to Lady. As he sits beside the wolf waiting for his \\nsword\\n, Ned considers the\\nnames his children chose for their wolves and finds that Sansa chose a good name for her well-behaved wolf. After\\nthe deed is done, Ned commands four guardsmen to return Lady’s body to \\nWinterfell\\n for burial, insisting that Cersei\\nwill never have her skin.\\nAs he is returning, Sandor Clegane and his riders come back from the hunt. Clegane states that while they didn’t\\n\\nfind Arya they did find her pet and drops a corpse at Ned’s feet. As he bends to uncover the corpse, Ned wonders\\nhow he will tell Arya.

Three days\\nafter arriving at the Wall, Jon had pleaded to be allowed to come on a ranging with his uncle. Benjen had told him\\nthat he was just a boy who had yet to earn the right to go. Benjen also explained that, while he loved \\nhis family\\n, the\\nmen of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n are his true brothers. The next morning, Benjen had had smiles, but not for Jon, telling\\nhim that they would speak when he returns.\\nJon goes to his sleeping cell to be with \\nGhost\\n, thinking of how much he misses his family. His thoughts are\\ninterrupted by the arrival of Grenn, \\nToad\\n, and two other recruits. All of them are brutes and bullies sent to the Wall\\nfor crimes. After Grenn insults Jon’s mother, a short fight breaks out that soon has Jon on the ground. However,\\nbefore the boys can hurt Jon, \\nDonal Noye\\n the smith intervenes.\\nAfter the others leave, Noye tells Jon that the Night’s Watch has need of every man and that there is no honor in\\nkilling boys like Grenn. When Jon insists that they insulted his mother, Noye points out that them saying it doesn’t\\nmake it true. When Noye reminds Jon that he is in the Night\\'s Watch for life, Jon reflects angrily on the fact that\\nDonal Noye had a life before taking the black. He feasted and wenched and fought in battles, only taking the black\\nafter losing an arm during the siege of \\nPyke\\n.\\nJon claims that the others hate him because he is better than them, but Noye insists that they hate him because he\\nthinks\\n he is better. Noye then calls Jon a bastard and a bully. Being called a bully surprises Jon because his attackers\\nwere all older and bigger than him. Noye explains that Jon has humiliated and shamed the other recruits, who have\\nhad no formal training in swordsmanship whereas Jon was trained by an anointed knight. Jon starts to feel ashamed\\nbut is still angry. Noye tells him to accept his life on the Wall and reconsider how he treats his companions, or else\\nto sleep with a dagger by his bed.\\nAs he leaves, Jon looks up at the Wall, a massive blue-white cliff of ice that fills up half the sky and dwarfs Castle\\nBlack beneath it. The Wall is the largest structure built by men according to Benjen and the most useless according\\nto Tyrion. Older than the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n, to Jon the Wall seems to represent the edge of the world.\\n\\nTyrion interrupts Jon’s look up at the Wall by commenting that it makes you wonder about what lies beyond. Since\\narriving, Jon has seen little of Tyrion, who has been an honored guest among the high officers. When Tyrion asks\\nJon if he is curious about what lies \\nbeyond the Wall\\n, Jon replies that there is nothing special but inside wishes he\\ncould have ridden with his uncle Benjen on a ranging. When Tyrion calls him “Lord Snow” by mistake, Jon objects\\nbut Tyrion asks him if he would prefer to be called “the Imp\" and reminds Jon to make his weakness his strength by\\naccepting it.\\nTyrion asks about Ghost, and Jon tells him that he chains the \\ndirewolf\\n in the old stables during training but that the\\nrest of the time he stays with Jon in his sleeping area in Harden’s Tower. Tyrion says he thought those buildings\\nwere abandoned but Jon explains that, since most of the undermanned castle is abandoned, nobody cares where a\\nperson sleeps. He continues on to tell Tyrion that he sleeps alone because the others are afraid of Ghost. Tyrion\\ndeclares the others wise, then mentions that Benjen Stark is late returning from his ranging. Jon recalls that his uncle\\nwas supposed to be back by his name day, which is now a fortnight past. Tyrion says that he has heard that a great\\nnumber of rangers have disappeared recently.\\nIn the Common Hall, Jon gets food and chooses a spot away from the other recruits and Tyrion sits opposite him.\\nSer Alliser interrupts Jon’s conversation to tell him that the \\nLord Commander\\n wants to speak with him about a\\nmessage concerning his half-brother. Tyrion suspects the worst and gives Jon his sympathy. Jon races to the\\nCommander’s Keep where Lord Commander \\nJeor Mormont\\n gives him a message from \\nRobb\\n at \\nWinterfell\\n. The\\nmessage explains that \\nBran\\n has woken up, but is now a paraplegic.\\nJon, overjoyed that Bran will live, rushes back to tell Tyrion. In his joy, Jon also apologizes to Grenn and offers to\\nshow him how to defend against the move that injured him. Ser Alliser sarcastically remarks that he would have an\\neasier time teaching a wolf to juggle than training Grenn to fight. Jon replies that he will take the wager as he would\\nlove to see Ghost juggle. All the men in the hall, including Grenn, begin to laugh. As Ser Alliser clenches his fist in\\nanger, Jon realizes that he has made himself a life-long enemy.\\nNavigation:\\nJon II\\n↑\\nCatelyn III\\n ←\\nJon III\\n→ \\nEddard IV\\n↓\\nJon IV\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 20: Eddard IV\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard III\\n↑\\nJon III\\n ←\\nEddard IV\\n→ \\nTyrion III\\n↓\\nEddard V\\nImmediately upon his arrival in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, \\nNed\\n is summoned to a meeting of the \\nsmall council\\n to plan a\\ntournament\\n. Afterward, \\nLittlefinger\\n intercepts him and leads him to where \\nCatelyn\\n is hiding, where they plan their\\nstrategy for justice.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n arrives in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n tired and ready for a meal and a hot bath. Instead, he is immediately informed by the\\nroyal steward that there is an urgent meeting of the \\nsmall council\\n that he must attend. After momentarily losing his\\ntemper, Ned decides it is best not to offend the council on his first day in the capital. Therefore, he tasks his own\\nsteward\\n to see that his daughters are guided to their rooms and that Arya is not allowed to go exploring.\\nIn borrowed clothes (his are all still packed), Ned arrives to find four members of the council waiting for him:\\nLittlefinger\\n the \\nmaster of coin\\n, \\nVarys\\n the \\nmaster of whisperers\\n, \\nRenly Baratheon\\n the \\nmaster of laws\\n, and \\nGrand\\nMaester\\n \\nPycelle\\n. The simpering eunuch Varys immediately expresses sorrow over the \\ntroubles\\n on the road and\\nassures Ned they are all praying for Prince \\nJoffrey\\n’s recovery. Ned coldly informs him that the prince grows\\nstronger every day. When he sees Renly, Ned is struck by how much he looks like a young \\nRobert\\n. Littlefinger\\nimmediately quips that Renly is much better dressed, having spent more on clothes than many ladies of the court.\\nUpon introducing himself to Ned for the first time, Littlefinger mentions that \\nCatelyn\\n has most likely mentioned him\\nbefore. Ned recalls that Littlefinger also knew his brother, \\nBrandon\\n, adding that Brandon mentioned him often and\\nwith some heat. Littlefinger responds that he would have thought heat did not suit the Starks, who are rumured to be\\nmade of ice and to melt south of the \\nNeck\\n. Ned replies that he does not plan on melting anytime soon.\\nAfter a short greeting to Grand Maester Pycelle, Ned asks after the other members of the council and is told that\\nStannis Baratheon\\n left for \\nDragonstone\\n shortly after the king went north and that both Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n and King\\nRobert are still riding through the city. When Ned suggests they wait, Renly explains that Robert finds the details of\\ncoin and crops boring and rarely bothers to attend. Then Renly says that the king sent him ahead to convene the\\ncouncil to handle an urgent matter and Littlefinger produces a sealed letter for Ned.\\nThe king\\'s letter contains an order that a \\ntourney\\n be held in honor of Ned\\'s appointment as \\nHand of the King\\n. Ned is\\nincredulous and not particularly happy with this extravagance being held in his name; the prizes alone total ninety\\nthousand gold dragons and the costs are sure to run high as well. When Ned questions whether the treasury will bear\\nthe expense, Littlefinger reveals that the Crown is already over six million gold pieces in debt, half of it to the\\nLannisters\\n. Ned is shocked; the \\nTargaryens\\n left a treasury overflowing with gold. He cannot believe that \\nJon Arryn\\nallowed Robert to beggar the realm, but the council explains that while Lord Arryn was a prudent man, Robert did\\nnot always listen. Ned insists that this tournament is something the realm cannot afford and declares that they will\\nconsider it later, then leaves abruptly.\\nAs Ned proceeds toward the \\nTower of the Hand\\n, reflecting on the miseries of the last fortnight of the journey south,\\nhe is intercepted by Littlefinger, who tells him he is going the wrong way. After a long journey through the \\nRed\\nKeep\\n, Ned eventually realizes that Littlefinger is not leading him to the Tower. Littlefinger explains that he is\\nleading Ned to his wife, but Ned does not believe him. Eventually, Littlefinger brings him to the foot of a bluff\\n\\noutside the castle, where they mount onto waiting horses and ride into the city.\\nLittlefinger leads Ned to a brothel he owns and tells him his wife is waiting inside. Ned is furious at being taken all\\nthis way to a brothel and holds a knife to Littlefinger\\'s throat, claiming his brother was too kind. He is interrupted by\\na man he eventually recognizes as Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n, disarming his suspicions. Littlefinger leads Ned upstairs to\\nmeet with Catelyn, explaining that a brothel is such a good hiding place because it is so unlikely.\\nAfter embracing and exchanging news with Catelyn, Ned sees the scars on her hands and she places the \\nValyrian\\nsteel dagger\\n used against \\nBran\\n in his hands. However, Ned cannot understand why \\nTyrion Lannister\\n would have\\nattempted to murder Bran. Littlefinger states that the reason is obvious, and that Tyrion would have never acted\\nalone. Ned tries to assure himself that Robert could never have been involved in this, but he remembers all the\\nhorrid things the king has either supported or ignored. Queen \\nCersei\\n, on the other hand, Ned has no trouble believing\\nto be responsible. Littlefinger reminds him that to accuse either is treason, but that if they can find proof of Cersei’s\\ninvolvement, it is possible the king will listen.\\nNed feels that he should take his case and the dagger directly to the king, but Littlefinger reminds him that there is\\nno solid proof that Tyrion was involved. Then Catelyn explains that she has told Littlefinger about their suspicions\\nconcerning Jon Arryn\\'s death, and that Littlefinger has promised to help them learn the truth. When Ned asks how\\nmuch Varys knows about all of this, he is told that Varys has not been told, but Catelyn warns that the man knows\\nthings no normal man has any way of knowing.\\nNed then asks Littlefinger to give him time alone with his wife. Littlefinger asks if they want time in a bed chamber\\nbut Ned tells him that will not be necessary; he just needs a little time. Catelyn goes to Littlefinger and tells him that\\nshe appreciates his efforts, and has found a brother that she thought she had lost. Ned is not so confident that\\nLittlefinger can be trusted, but says nothing. After Littlefinger leaves, Ned gives Catelyn instructions for his\\nbannermen to fortify \\nMoat Cailin\\n and to keep a careful watch over \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n in case \\nhis father\\'s\\n \\nfleet\\n is needed.\\nHe hopes it will not come to war and that Robert will believe him when he finds out what happened. \\u2003\\nNavigation:\\nEddard III\\n↑\\nJon III\\n ←\\nEddard IV\\n→ \\nTyrion III\\n↓\\nEddard V\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 21: Tyrion III\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion II\\n↑\\nEddard IV\\n ←\\nTyrion III\\n→ \\nArya II\\n↓\\nTyrion IV\\nTyrion\\n dines with high officers of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n and promises \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n that he will speak to\\nthe \\nking\\n of their need. Afterwards, while paying a final visit to \\nthe Wall\\n, Tyrion meets \\nJon Snow\\n, who asks Tyrion\\nto do what he can to help his brother \\nBran\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n is dining with the high officers of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n on his last night at \\nCastle Black\\n. \\nLord Commander\\nMormont\\n proclaims Tyrion a cunning man and asks him if he must leave so soon, saying that \\nthe Wall\\n needs men\\nlike him. Tyrion brushes off the suggestion with an offer to scour the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n for dwarfs. An offended Ser\\nAlliser Thorne\\n claims that Tyrion mocks the Watch, but Tyrion counters that he is only mocking Ser Alliser. Thorne\\ndemands that Tyrion make his japes with steel in hand. Tyrion replies that he already has steel in his hand: a fork,\\nwhich he brandishes against Thorne in a mock attack. A roar of laughter rises from the other officers and Ser Alliser\\nleaves in disgust.\\nAfter claiming Ser Alliser’s meal as his spoils of victory, Tyrion comments that a man like Ser Alliser should be\\nmucking out the stable, not drilling the recruits. Mormont takes the opportunity to complain about the quality of his\\nmen; Ser Alliser is one of the few living knights to have taken the black. Ser \\nJaremy Rykker\\n goes on to explain that\\nboth he and Thorne fought for King \\nAerys II Targaryen\\n during the \\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n and were forced to take\\nthe black or be executed by Tyrion’s father, Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n. Tyrion’s only comment is that his father is\\nindeed very fond of heads on spikes.\\nTyrion asks for more wine and \\nBowen Marsh\\n comments that he has a great thirst for a small man. \\nMaester Aemon\\nstates that Tyrion is a giant among them at the edge of the world. Tyrion, speechless at being called a giant, calls the\\nmaester kind, which leaves the maester equally amused.\\nWhen they retire to the fire, Mormont informs Tyrion that he will receive an escort as far as \\nWinterfell\\n. Tyrion soon\\nrealizes that the Lord Commander is working his way up to asking a favor and so cuts right to it by asking if there is\\nany way he can repay the Watch’s kindness. Mormont beseeches Tyrion to speak to King \\nRobert\\n about the condition\\nof the Night’s Watch and its need for men. Mormont goes on to elaborate on the high rate of disappearance among\\ntheir ranging parties, including Ser \\nWaymar Royce\\n and \\nBenjen Stark\\n. The Watch’s strength is now under a thousand\\nmen, leaving only three men to guard each mile of the Wall. Then Mormont laments that he is old and there is no\\none qualified to take over command because the Watch has become an army of sullen boys and old men. He has\\nmaybe 20 men that can read, and fewer who can think or lead. Tyrion promises that he will tell the King, his father,\\nand his brother but he knows that it will do no good.\\nMormont then asks Tyrion how many winters he has seen. When Tyrion replies with nine, Mormont adds that they\\nhave all been short. The long summer is ending and portents say a long winter is coming. When Tyrion suggest the\\nfabled endless summer may have come, Mormont insists the days are already growing shorter. Mormont then\\nconfides to Tyrion that the \\nwildlings\\n are massing and moving south, running scared from something worse than just\\nthe cold. Tyrion, bored by Mormont’s dark words, reiterates his promises and leaves.\\nOutside it is bitter cold. As he walks the castle ground, Tyrion is taken by a whim to climb the Wall one last time.\\n\\nHis legs are cramping too much to climb the stairs, so Tyrion takes the winch cage up. At the top he meets \\nJon Snow\\nwith \\nGhost\\n. As they walk, Tyrion asks how the recruits are doing under Jon’s instruction. Jon tells him that they are\\ngetting better.\\nTyrion offers to carry any messages that Jon might have south to Winterfell and is rewarded with a torrent of\\nrequests. Most of all Jon wants Tyrion to help his crippled brother \\nBran\\n. At first, Tyrion denies that has anything to\\noffer Bran, but Jon insists that words will be enough. When Tyrion agrees, Jon thanks him from the heart and calls\\nhim “friend.” Tyrion, deeply moved by the gesture, quips that while many of his kin are bastards, Jon is the first that\\nhe could call a friend, and they shake hands.\\nThey both look out over the \\nHaunted Forest\\n north of the Wall. As they watch, Jon says that he has been watching for\\nhis Uncle Benjen. Tyrion assures Jon that Benjen will return one day. When Jon declares that if his uncle does not\\ncome back he and Ghost will go north to find him, Tyrion wonders who will go out searching for Jon and shivers at\\nthe thought.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion II\\n↑\\nEddard IV\\n ←\\nTyrion III\\n→ \\nArya II\\n↓\\nTyrion IV\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 22: Arya II\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya I\\n↑\\nTyrion III\\n ←\\nArya II\\n→ \\nDaenerys III\\n↓\\nArya III\\nUnhappy at \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, \\nArya\\n abandons her dinner. Her \\nfather\\n comes to her room to talk to her and sees she has\\nher sword\\n out. After a long talk, he decides not to take the sword away. Several days later, Arya meets her new\\ndancing master.\\nSynopsis\\nWhen \\nher father\\n enters the Small Hall after dinner has already begun Arya can tell that he has been fighting with the\\ncouncil\\n again. \\nJory Cassel\\n asks about the \\ntourney\\n everyone is talking about, and Eddard asks if anyone is talking\\nabout the \\nHand\\n’s displeasure with the whole idea.\\nSansa\\n is tremendously excited by the prospect of a tourney and begs to be allowed to attend. When \\nSepta\\n \\nMordane\\nmentions his family will be expected to attend, Eddard agrees to ensure that seats are provided for both Sansa and\\nArya. Knowing that Prince \\nJoffrey\\n will be there, Arya insists she does not want to attend a stupid tourney. When\\nSansa taunts that Arya would not be wanted anyway, Eddard loses his temper and threatens to change his mind.\\nQuickly regaining his composure, Eddard excuses himself. Once he is gone, his guardsmen start talking excitedly\\nabout the tourney. No one talks to Arya but she likes it that way. Back in \\nWinterfell\\n she had enjoyed listening to the\\nmen talk, but now the sounds irritate her because she blames them all, even her father, for doing nothing to save\\nLady\\n and \\nMycah\\n.\\nAfter looking disgustedly at her cold food and the people around her, Arya pushes away from the table. When Septa\\nMordane insists that Arya hasn’t eaten, she dashes away. She runs to her chamber and locks herself in. She digs to\\nthe bottom of her chest where her sword \\nNeedle\\n is hidden. Arya thinks that if she could climb like her brother \\nBran\\nshe could steal some food and run away and that if \\nJon Snow\\n was there she would not feel so lonely.\\nA soft knock on her door proves to be her father, who says they need to talk and asks politely to come in. From the\\nway he talks, Arya is ashamed to realize he is more sad than angry. When she lets him in, her father immediately\\nnotices her sword and asks whose it is. Arya explains that it is hers and her father asks to see it. Her father notices\\nMikken\\n’s mark on the blade and remarks that if his nine-year-old daughter can be armed from his own forge without\\nhis knowledge, how can he be expected to rule the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n?\\nEddard asks who gave her the sword but Arya stays silent, not wanting to betray Jon. Her father accepts this but tells\\nArya that a sword is not a toy. When asked what she thinks Septa Mordane would say about her playing with a\\nsword, Arya insists she was not playing. Eddard states that he should break the sword over his knee. Arya responds\\nthat “Needle wouldn’t break.” The sword having a name amuses her father, who claims that Arya reminds him of his\\nsister, \\nLyanna\\n, who might have carried a sword if \\ntheir father\\n had allowed it. Arya is surprised when Eddard says\\nshe looks like her aunt, who was always described as beautiful, something never said of Arya.\\nEddard asks if Arya knows anything about how to use a sword, and she replies with the advice Jon gave her: “Stick\\n\\'em with the pointy end.” She tells how she was trying to learn and sadly adds that she asked Mycah to practice with\\nher. In grief she starts to sob against her father’s chest. He tells her that Mycah’s death was not her fault. Arya sobs\\nthat she hates them all: the \\nQueen\\n, the Hound, Joffrey, and the King. Then she adds that Joffery lied, and that she\\n\\nalso hates Sansa.\\nEddard says that everyone lies and that he does not believe that \\nNymeria\\n ran off. Arya then exclaims that Jory\\npromised not to tell. Eddard informs her that Jory did not tell but that he had figured it out, because even a blind man\\ncould tell that the wolf would not have left willingly. Arya then explains how she and Jory had to throw rocks to\\ndrive the wolf away. She then asks her father if she did the right thing and Eddard assures her that she did.\\nEddard then tells Arya that winter is coming. He explains to her how wolves stick together, and that in the winter a\\nlone wolf dies. Now there are enemies threatening the \\nStarks\\n, so they must stick together like a pack of wolves and it\\nis time for her to start growing up. He hands Arya back her sword, saying she can keep it; he only asks that she not\\nstick her sister.\\nThree days later, Arya is sent to the Small Hall by the \\nsteward\\n. She is met by \\nSyrio Forel\\n, a former \\nFirst Sword\\n of\\nBraavos\\n. He tells her that he is her dancing master, and throws her a wooden sword, which she cannot catch.\\nUnperturbed, Syrion tells Arya that the next day she will be there at midday and catch the blade. She picks the\\npractice sword up as instructed and finds that it is very heavy. When she complains about the weight, Syrio explains\\nthat it is heavy to make her strong. Then he fixes her grip, telling her not to squeeze too tight. When Arya says that\\nshe might drop it, Syrio tells her that the sword must become a part of her arm, and that she cannot drop a part of her\\narm.\\nWhen Syrio calls her a boy for the third time Arya objects. He insists that it does not matter; a sword has no gender.\\nHe then explains that what he will be teaching her is not the hacking and hammering iron dance of \\nWesteros\\n, but the\\nswift and sudden Water Dance of Braavos,.

Daenerys sees she has out-distanced the rest of \\nDrogo\\n’s \\nkhalasar\\n, who are still climbing the ridge behind\\nher. Among them she can see her brother \\nViserys\\n struggling with his riding. The sight brings back the memory of\\nIllyrio Mopatis\\n offering to let Viserys stay in \\nPentos\\n as his guest. Viserys had refused and insisted on coming with\\nthe \\nkhalasar\\n to ensure that Drogo would give him the army that he promised. Daenerys commands Jorah and the\\nothers to wait. Mormont comments that Daenerys is starting to sound like a queen but Daenerys corrects him, calling\\nherself a \\nkhaleesi\\n.\\nAs she rides out alone, Daenerys reflects on how the days of the journey have hardened her body. She no longer has\\nopen saddle sores nor does she suffer unbearable pain after a day’s ride. At first, Drogo would ignore Daenerys to\\nspend his days talking, drinking, and racing with his \\nbloodriders\\n, leaving her to eat meals alone or with Viserys and\\nJorah Mormont. Yet every night Drogo would come and ride her from behind. She had been miserable until she had\\ndreamt of a dragon that engulfed her in flame and cleansed her. After that, each day had been easier than the one\\nbefore it and she had found pleasure in the new sights of the journey, even starting to enjoy sex with Drogo.\\nOnce she is totally alone, Daenerys decides to dismount and take off her boots so she can feel the earth. Suddenly,\\nViserys is there, screaming and grabbing her. He is furious that she commanded him to stay on the ridge with the\\nothers. For the first time in her life, Daenerys shoves him back.

Before he can, \\nJhogo\\n’s whip catches Viserys around the\\nneck and pulls him to the ground.\\nHer handmaiden \\nIrri\\n translates for them as Jhogo asks if Daenerys would like to see Viserys dead or disfigured as\\npunishment for his attack. Daenerys declines, but tells them to take Viserys’ horse and make him walk, an\\nemasculating punishment among the horselords. Viserys, now recovered enough to shout, orders Ser Jorah to kill the\\nDothraki and discipline Daenerys, but the exiled knight makes the decision to turn to Daenerys and agree that\\nViserys should walk.\\nDaenerys is amazed that she hit Viserys and asks Jorah if she has woken the dragon in Viserys. Jorah replies her\\nbrother Rhaegar was the last Dragon, while Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake. Daenerys insists that Viserys\\nis still the rightful king, but when Jorah asks if she would want her brother as the king, she realizes that Viserys’\\nwould not be a good king. Even so, Daenerys remains convinced that the people of \\nWesteros\\n are praying for Viserys\\nreturn until Jorah explains that peasants only pray for rain, health, and a summer that never ends.

Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell like\\nno other, and there came \\na night that lasted a generation\\n. In that darkness came the Others: cold dead things that\\nhated fire, iron, the touch of the sun, and every creature with warm blood. They overran holdfasts and cities and all\\nthe swords of men could not stop their advance. Women and children were not spared, and the Others ate the flesh\\nof children. This was before the \\nAndals\\n and the \\nRhoynar\\n had come, when the \\nFirst Men\\n lived in the lands they had\\ntaken from the \\nchildren of the forest\\n. The \\nlast hero\\n of the First Men set out to find the children with his sword, a dog,\\nhis horse, and twelve companions. All of the hero’s companions and even his dog died, and he was left in despair of\\never finding the children as the Others closed in.\\nOld Nan’s story is interrupted by \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n, who tells Bran that he is needed in the Great Hall to greet \\nTyrion\\nLannister\\n and some men of the \\nNight’s Watch\\n, who are down from \\nthe Wall\\n with a message from his brother \\nJon\\n.\\nBran complains that he wants to hear the rest of Nan’s story, but Nan tells him that stories can wait. Hodor, the\\nseven-foot stableboy, carries Bran down to the hall with Maester Luwin struggling to keep up.\\nRobb is sitting in his father’s high seat, wearing his armor with his sword across his lap. Even Bran knows what it\\nmeans to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword and can feel the hostility in the room. Robb makes a point of only\\noffering his welcome to the Night’s Watch men. The meaning is not lost on Tyrion, who notes that he is not\\n\\nwelcome and calls Robb a boy. Robb seethes, insisting that he is a lord. Tyrion responds that if that is so he needs to\\nshow a lord’s courtesy.\\nWhen Bran is brought forward, Tyrion notes that news of his survival was true and declares that Starks are hard to\\nkill. Robb declares that the \\nLannisters\\n had best remember that and lifts Bran into the high seat. Tyrion asks how\\nBran fell, but Bran insists that he \\nnever\\n falls. Maester Luwin is quick to add that Bran does not remember. Tyrion\\ncalls this curious, then asks if Bran likes to ride. Immediately, the maester insists that Bran has lost the use of his\\nlegs, and so cannot ride. Tyrion responds that with the right saddle and horse even a cripple can ride. Angered, Bran\\ninsists that he is not a cripple, but Tyrion retorts that if that is true then he is not a dwarf. Tyrion hands the maester a\\npaper containing plans he has drawn up for a saddle for Bran. The maester states that it will work and he should\\nhave thought of it himself. Tyrion responds that the idea came easier to him, since the design is similar to his own\\nsaddle. Robb is suspicious of Tyrion’s motive, to which Tyrion replies that Jon asked it of him, and he has a weak\\nspot for cripples, bastards, and broken things.\\nRickon comes in from outside with the three direwolves, who immediately start growling and surround Tyrion.\\nTheon\\n comments that the wolves do not like Tyrion’s smell. Tyrion says that it is time he took his leave, but the\\nwolves assault him before he can move more than a step. They are called off in time by the boys. Tyrion finds the\\nhostility of the wolves to be interesting, and states nothing is harmed save his dignity. Even Robb is shaken and says\\nhe does not know why the wolves attacked. Before Tyrion can leave, Maester Luwin confers with Robb, who then\\noffers the hospitality of Winterfell to Tyrion. Tyrion declines the invitation as a false courtesy, declaring that he will\\nstay in the inn he saw outside the wall.\\nRobb then tells the Night’s Watch men they have rooms prepared, and invites them for dinner. Bran is looking\\nforward to feasting that night with the Night’s Watch. In his room, Bran expresses his excitement at being able to\\nride again to Summer. Bran dreams of climbing, and sees the shapes of twisted and grotesque gargoyles, and then he\\nhears them whispering. The gargoyles pull themselves free and climb towards Bran. Bran starts to scream, shouting\\nthat he did not hear. He wakes to find Hodor above him. Hodor cleans and dresses him and carries him down to the\\nGreat Hall.\\nThat evening, Robb and Bran host the Night’s Watch men for dinner. The black brothers bring the dire tidings of\\nBenjen Stark\\n. \\nYoren\\n states that Benjen is probably dead, but Robb vehemently disagrees. One of the brothers\\nassures them that Benjen knows the haunted forest better than anyone, and will find his way back. Bran thinks of\\nOld Nan’s stories and blurts out that uncle Benjen will be saved by the children of the forest. Maester Luwin tells\\nhim the children have been dead for thousands of years, but Yoren disagrees, wondering who’s to say what lives\\nbeyond the Wall?\\nThat night Robb carries Bran up to his bed himself. Robb sits by Bran for a long time, and tells him that they will\\nfind a horse for him. Bran asks if the others will be coming back. Robb says yes with much hope in his voice. Robb\\nthen tells Bran that he can meet his mother riding his new horse and later they can visit the Wall together.\\nNavigation:\\nBran III\\n↑\\nDaenerys III\\n ←\\nBran IV\\n→ \\nEddard V\\n↓\\nBran V\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 25: Eddard V\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard IV\\n↑\\nBran IV\\n ←\\nEddard V\\n→ \\nJon IV\\n↓\\nEddard VI\\nNed\\n speaks with \\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n about Lord \\nJon Arryn\\n’s final days. On his way back, he finds \\nArya\\n training\\nto be a \\nwater dancer\\n on the steps of the \\nTower of the Hand\\n. Later, he is visited by \\nLittlefinger\\n who has found four of\\nLord Arryn’s household remaining in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n meets with Grand \\nMaester\\n \\nPycelle\\n in the stifling heat that has covered the city. Pycelle talks about how the\\nsmallfolk claim that the last year of summer is the hottest. The Grand Maester goes on to say that he does not\\nbelieve this, noting that the King Maekar’s Summer was even hotter and broke in the seventh year, leading to a short\\nautumn and a terrible long winter. Then Pycelle digresses about being a young man, forging his maester’s chain\\nduring the reign of King \\nMaekar I\\n.\\nFinally, Pycelle remembers that Ned asked about \\nJon Arryn\\n and explains that Lord Arryn was melancholy but\\nhealthy, then suddenly became ill. He had asked Pycelle about a \\nbook\\n, and Pycelle remembers noting that something\\nwas troubling him. The next day, Lord Arryn was twisted over in pain, unable to get out of bed. Ned mentions that\\nhe has heard that Pycelle sent away Lord Arryn’s maester. Pycelle states that this was because he felt Maester\\nColemon\\n didn’t understand the older body and was endangering Lord Arryn\\'s life with purging potions.\\nNed asks if Lord Arryn had any final words. Pycelle responds that Jon Arryn called out the name “Robert” several\\ntimes, but does not know if he was talking about \\nthe king\\n or \\nhis son\\n. His last words were whispered to \\nLysa Arryn\\nand King Robert: \"The seed is strong.\"\\nNext, Ned asks if there was anything unnatural about the death, and follows up by asking if Pycelle had seen\\nanything like this illness before. Pycelle states that he has seen more of illness than he would like to remember and\\nthat every illness is different and yet alike. Eventually, Pycelle says that Jon Arryn’s death was no stranger than any\\nother. When Ned mentions that Lysa thinks otherwise, Pycelle says that grief can derange minds--and Lysa’s mind\\nwas not the best before, seeing enemies in every corner.\\nWhen Ned suggests that Jon Arryn could have been poisoned, the Grand Maester rebuffs him, asking who would do\\nsuch a thing. Ned replies that he has heard poison is a woman’s weapon. Pycelle replies that poison is the preferred\\nweapon of women, cravens, and eunuchs. He continues by telling Ned that \\nVarys\\n was born a slave in \\nLys\\n, and that\\nNed shouldn’t trust him. Ned scarcely needs reminding, as he already has a bad feeling about Varys.\\nNed excuses himself but the Grand Maester halts him to offer any other service Ned may require. Ned uses the\\nopportunity to ask for the book Jon Arryn asked for. Pycelle says it is a ponderous tome of lineages that Ned would\\nfind boring. Ned insists he would like to see the book in any case, and Pycelle promises to send it to him once he\\nfinds it. On the way out, Ned also learns that Queen \\nCersei\\n was not in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n when Jon Arryn died.\\nPycelle’s parting words are “I am here to serve,” leading Ned to think, “Yes, but whom.”\\nOn his return to the \\nTower of the Hand\\n, Ned finds \\nArya\\n on the steps, standing on one foot. When Ned asks what she\\nis doing she tells him that \\nSyrio Forel\\n says that a \\nwater dancer\\n can stand on one toe for hours. Ned expresses his\\nconcern about her falling down the steps but Arya states that a water dancer never falls. Then Arya asks if \\nBran\\n will\\n\\ncome to live with them now, and Ned responds that first he must grow stronger. Speaking of Bran leads Ned to\\nrecall taking the girls to the castle \\ngodswood\\n to offer their thanks when the news of Bran’s recovery arrived. The\\ngirls had gone to sleep and dreamed of Bran while Ned stood vigil all night.\\nWhile balancing on her leg, Arya asks about Bran’s plans to be a knight of the \\nKingsguard\\n. Ned admits that Bran\\nwon\\'t become a knight, but he may become a lord, a councilor, an architect, an explorer, or even the \\nHigh Septon\\n,\\neven while privately noting that Bran will never lie with a woman or father a son. When Arya asks if she can do any\\nof these things, Ned says that she will marry a king and her sons will do these things. Arya replies that that is \\nSansa\\n,\\nnot her.\\nLater, Ned meets with \\nLittlefinger\\n in his solar. Littlefinger, who is watching the Kingsguard practicing in the yard\\nbelow, starts with small talk about who might win the tourney. This does not interest Ned at all, so he asks\\nLittlefinger to get to the point. Ned cannot find it in himself to trust Littlefinger. Littlefinger tells him that four of\\nJon Arryn’s household are still in the city, which surprises Ned, who thought that all had gone back to the \\nEyrie\\n with\\nLysa.\\nLittlefinger reveals the names, which include Jon Arryn\\'s squire, Ser \\nHugh\\n of the Vale. He also reveals that Ser\\nHugh was knighted by the king after Lord Arryn died. Ned states that he will send for them, but Littlefinger does not\\nthink this is a good idea and asks Ned to come to the window. Littlefinger identifies some of the spies among those\\noutside his window: one is Varys’, the other is the queen’s. He tells Ned that there are others, and some even he does\\nnot know. He cautions Ned to send a man he trusts completely to question these people rather than doing it himself;\\neven Varys cannot watch every man in Ned\\'s service every hour of the day. As Littlefinger departs, Ned expresses\\nhis gratitude and says he was perhaps wrong to distrust him. Littlefinger fingers his beard and replies that distrusting\\nhim is the wisest thing Ned has done since he climbed down off his horse.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard IV\\n↑\\nBran IV\\n ←\\nEddard V\\n→ \\nJon IV\\n↓\\nEddard VI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 26: Jon IV\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon III\\n↑\\nEddard V\\n ←\\nJon IV\\n→ \\nEddard VI\\n↓\\nJon V\\nSamwell Tarly\\n appears in the yard while \\nJon\\n is training the other recruits. When Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\n orders Sam\\nbeaten after he yields, Jon and his friends aid the new recruit. Later Jon talks with Sam and, afterwards, convinces\\nthe other recruits to go easy on Sam, despite Thorne’s commands.\\nSynopsis\\nJon\\n is helping the other recruits with their swordsmanship when \\nSamwell Tarly\\n, the fattest boy he has ever seen,\\nenters the yard. Sam nervously explains he has been told to come there for training, and \\nPyp\\n identifies him by his\\nvoice as a lordling from near \\nHighgarden\\n. Sam is immediately ridiculed by Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\n, who says they are\\nnow sending pigs to man \\nthe Wall\\n. Although Sam has brought his own armor, none of it is black so he has to be\\nreequipped, which requires some ingenuity by the armorer.\\nWhen Sam returns, Ser Alliser sends \\nHalder\\n, a very strong boy, against him. In under a minute Sam is on the ground\\nwith a broken helm, screaming that he yields. When Sam refuses to stand up, Thorne tells Halder to hit him with the\\nflat of the blade until he gets up. The initial hit is tentative, but Thorne insists that Halder can hit harder and the next\\nblow splits leather. Jon’s objections are initially stopped by Pyp, but after another blow Jon shakes him off and\\nstates there is no honor in beating a beaten foe.\\nJon helps Sam up, which Ser Alliser mocks as “defending his lady love.” Declaring it a training exercise, Thorne\\nsends Halder, \\nRast\\n, and \\nAlbett\\n to get past Jon to beat Sam. Jon braces himself for a hard fight; Ser Alliser has sent\\ntwo boys against him before, but never three. To Jon’s surprise, Pyp and \\nGrenn\\n come to his aid. The boys going\\nagainst Jon hesitate, but Jon attacks. Jon soon takes out Halder, but not before taking a damaging blow to his\\nshoulder. Then he helps Pyp take down Rast. Once Rast is down, Albett yields and Ser Alliser leaves in a fury.\\nHalder wrenches off his helmet and throws it across the yard, declaring that he thought he had Jon. Jon admits that\\nhe almost did. When Jon attempts to remove his helmet, his shoulder is painful. Sam, his head bloody where his\\nhelmet had been split, comes over and helps Jon remove the helmet gently. Sam introduces himself and Jon\\nintroduces himself, Grenn, and Pyp; Sam thanks them all. When asked why he did not fight back, Sam states that\\ncouldn’t because he is a coward. Jon and his friends are speechless—who would admit that he was coward? Seeing\\nthe response of Jon and his friends, Sam apologizes to them, stating he does not like being a coward. As Sam leaves\\nfor the armory, Jon tells him tomorrow he will do better, but Sam insists that he will not.\\nAfter Sam leaves, Grenn states nobody likes cowards, and is worried what others will think if they are associated\\nwith a coward. Pyp’s response is that if Grenn met a bear in the woods he would be too stupid to run away. Grenn\\ninsists he would run faster than Pyp, then attacks Pyp when he realizes the trick.\\nFor the recruits, mornings are for swordplay and afternoons for other work, which is varied so that the Watch can\\nmeasure a recruit’s skills. That afternoon Jon is to spread gravel on top of the wall by himself. This gives him a\\nchance to contemplate Sam. He thinks about \\nTyrion Lannister\\n’s statement about denying a hard truth and realizes\\nthat Sam’s admission of cowardice took a certain kind of courage.\\nWhen he enters the common hall where dinner is almost done, Jon passes his friends and joins Sam, who is sitting\\n\\nby himself. After introducing \\nGhost\\n and some polite conversation, Jon asks Sam to join him outside to talk. As they\\nwalk, Sam admits that he did not think the \\nNight’s Watch\\n would be like this; all the buildings are falling down, and\\nit is so cold. Jon suggests it must have been warmer where Sam lived, and Sam explains that he had never seen snow\\nuntil a month ago.\\nJon leads Sam to \\nthe Wall\\n, but Sam balks at climbing the great wooden stairs. Jon replies that there is a winch, but\\nSam states he does not like heights. When Jon asks why a boy who is afraid of everything would join the Night’s\\nWatch, Sam starts to cry until Ghost licks his face, which makes them both laugh. They continue talking and before\\nlong Jon starts talking about \\nWinterfell\\n. Jon reveals a dream he’s been having of returning to Winterfell to find it\\ncompletely empty. As he is telling about the dream, Jon thinks about how several rangings have been made to find\\nBenjen Stark\\n, whose trail just disappears. In his dream, Jon always finds himself descending the stairs to the crypt in\\ndark, and it is then that he wakes up.\\nJon asks if Sam ever dreams of \\nHorn Hill\\n. Sam insists that he does not, and that he hated it there. After a long\\nsilence, Sam tells the story of why he was sent to the Wall. His father, Lord \\nRandyll Tarly\\n, was disgusted that his\\neldest son was so plump, soft, awkward, and squeamish. Sam’s interest in music, books, dancing, and soft clothes\\nonly made matters worse. Many masters-at-arms were brought to Horn Hill to try to make Sam into the type of\\nmany his father wanted. When a second son, \\nDickon\\n was finally born, Lord Randyll had given up on Sam. On his\\n15th name day, Sam says, he was escorted to his father in a wood, where he was informed that he was to forsake his\\nclaim to Horn Hill and join the Night’s Watch, or else his father would arrange an accident. Jon finds it strange that\\nSam tells the story in such a detached voice and does not weep even once. Jon tells Sam about some of the other\\nrecruits, and Sam eventually states he should get some sleep and plods off.\\nJon returns to the common room. His friends explain that they did not shun Sam; there were places on the bench but\\nSam was such a craven that he just passed them by. Jon persuades them all to not beat Sam anymore, whatever Ser\\nAlliser says. \\nRast\\n, however, insists that if Thorne sends him against “Lady Piggy,” he will cut off a rasher of bacon,\\nand laughs in Jon’s face. That night, Jon—with Pyp, Grenn, and Ghost—visits Rast in his cell. With Ghost’s mouth\\naround Rast\\'s throat, Jon tells Rast that they know where he sleeps.\\nAfter that, no matter what Ser Alliser does, he cannot get any of the recruits to do anything but tap Sam when they\\nare put up against him. Sam later thanks Jon and calls him his first friend; Jon responds that they are not friends but\\nbrothers. Jon now realizes that \\nRobb\\n, \\nBran\\n and \\nRickon\\n are his father’s sons, but that he has never been one of them;\\nhis true brothers are the outcasts of the Night’s Watch. He realizes his uncle was right, and wonders if he will ever\\nsee Benjen again to tell him.\\nNavigation:\\nJon III\\n↑\\nEddard V\\n ←\\nJon IV\\n→ \\nEddard VI\\n↓\\nJon V\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 27: Eddard VI\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard V\\n↑\\nJon IV\\n ←\\nEddard VI\\n→ \\nCatelyn V\\n↓\\nEddard VII\\nNed\\n and the \\nsmall council\\n deal with policing problems caused by the upcoming \\ntourney\\n. After the meeting, \\nJory\\nCassel\\n reports to Ned on interviews with \\nJon Arryn\\n’s remaining household. The report includes mention of visits by\\nLord Arryn and \\nStannis Baratheon\\n to a \\nbrothel\\n and an \\narmorer\\n. Ned orders Jory to identify the brothel and goes to\\nvisit the armorer himself. There he discovers an apprentice named \\nGendry\\n who looks astonishingly like King\\nRobert\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n and the \\nsmall council\\n hear \\nCity Watch\\n Commander \\nJanos Slynt\\n’s report about the significant increase in crime\\ncaused by the influx of people arriving for the upcoming tourney. Slynt requests more men. Ned agrees to hire fifty\\nnew watchmen, setting \\nLittlefinger\\n to arrange the monetary details. When Littlefinger objects, Ned insists that since\\nhe found 40,000 \\ngold dragons\\n for the champion’s purse, he should be able to scrape together a few coppers to keep\\nthe King’s Peace. Ned also loans Slynt twenty of his own household guard.\\nNed complains again about the tourney, still irritated that it is to be called \"\\nthe Hand\\'s tourney\\n\" despite his distaste.\\nMoreover, King \\nRobert\\n still insists that Ned should feel honored. Grand \\nMaester\\n \\nPycelle\\n points out that a tourney is\\ngood for the realm because it brings the great an opportunity for glory and the lowly a respite from their woes.\\nLittlefinger adds that it brings in lots of money, emphasizing full inns and whores walking bowlegged. Lord \\nRenly\\nlaughs, telling how his brother \\nStannis\\n once proposed outlawing brothels, prompting Robert to ask if he wanted to\\noutlaw eating, shitting, and breathing as well. Renly goes on to wonder how Stannis ever fathered his \\ndaughter\\n when\\nhe goes to his marriage bed like he is marching to a battlefield to do his duty. Everyone laughs except Ned, who is\\npreoccupied by thoughts of when Stannis will return and assume his \\nduties\\n on the council.\\nAfter the council adjourns, Ned returns to the \\nTower of the Hand\\n and summons \\nJory Cassel\\n. As he waits for his\\nhorse to be saddled, Ned peruses the book that \\nJon Arryn\\n had been reading prior to his death: \\nLineages of the Great\\nHouses\\n by Grand Maester \\nMalleon\\n. Its reading has proven extremely tedious, just as Pycelle warned, and scarcely a\\nman now alive had been born when it was written, but Ned is sure \\nJon Arryn\\n had a reason for reading it. As he\\nbrowses the section on \\nHouse Lannister\\n, Ned muses on their long history and the myths of their ancestor \\nLann the\\nClever\\n, who stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair.\\nJory arrives and briefs Ned on his interview with one of Jon Arryn’s stableboys, the last of the four leads provided\\nby Littlefinger. Ser \\nHugh\\n proved brusque, arrogant, and uninformative. The serving girl could only say that Jon\\nArryn had been reading too much, concerned about his \\nson\\n’s frailty, and gruff with his \\nwife\\n. Meanwhile, the pot boy\\nwas only able to provide lots of kitchen gossip, including that Lord Stannis had accompanied Lord Arryn to meet an\\narmorer\\n about elaborate new armor. The stableboy proves just as informative. He swears that Lord Arryn was as\\nstrong as a man half his age and often went riding with Lord Stannis. This Ned finds strange; as far as he knew, Jon\\nand Stannis were never friendly. Jory says that the stableboy also claims that Stannis and Jon Arryn visited a brothel\\ntogether. Unfortunately, the boy did not know which brothel; only the guards that escorted them would know, and\\nthey were taken back to the \\nEyrie\\n with Lady \\nLysa\\n.\\nThat Stannis would visit a brothel is very strange because he is so stern and humorless. That Stannis’ name keeps\\ncoming up and that he has left the city with no word about when he will return also vexes Ned. He wonders why\\n\\nStannis would leave and decides that something must have frightened him, yet Ned cannot imagine what could have\\nfrightened Stannis, who withstood the year-long \\nSiege of Storm\\'s End\\n by surviving on rats and boot leather. Both\\nNed and Jory find it frustrating that that everyone that might know the truth is a thousand leagues away. When Jory\\nasks if he will call Stannis back from \\nDragonstone\\n, Ned says not yet.\\nNed plans to visit the armorer himself and decides to wear his doublet with the direwolf sigil so the armorer will\\nknow who he is. As Jory dresses him, Ned wonders why Renly was not invited on the rides. Ned does not know\\nwhat to make of Renly with his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days back, Renly showed him a locket with a\\npicture of \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n. He asked Ned if she resembled \\nLyanna\\n and seemed disappointed when Ned shrugged.\\nNed finds it queer that Renly, who looks so much like \\nRobert\\n, would be obsessed with a lady that he thought looked\\nlike Lyanna.\\nNed tells Jory that it would be good if Stannis returned for the tourney, but Jory’s response makes Ned more certain\\nthat Stannis will not. He also wonders why Lord Arryn would be interested in showy armor when he had always\\nconsidered armor something for protection, not ornament. Ned then tells Jory that he better start visiting brothels,\\nwhich Jory jokingly calls a “hard duty.”\\nThe streets of \\nKing’s Landing\\n are crowded, but Ned and his guardsmen \\nVarly\\n and \\nJacks\\n make it through the crowd\\nto the \\nMud Gate\\n where Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n is arriving with his retinue to participate in the Tourney of the Hand.\\nAt the \\ntop\\n of the \\nStreet of Steel\\n they find the huge house of the armorer \\nTobho Mott\\n. After shouldering his way in, a\\nserving girl notices Ned’s sigil and badge of office and Tobho Mott quickly appears, offering wine. Mott\\nimmediately tells Ned that his prices are not cheap but his craftsmanship in unequaled in the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n. He\\nadds proudly that \\nthe Knight of Flowers\\n buys all his armor from him and that he can work \\nValyrian steel\\n.\\nNed lets the armorer go on for a while before he asks if Jon Arryn bought a falcon helm from him. Mott says that\\nLord Arryn bought nothing, only wanting to see the apprentice boy named \\nGendry\\n. Any hint of friendliness leaves\\nMott when Ned asks to see the boy as well. In the hot stone barn that contains the forges, the armorer introduces\\nGendry and shows Ned a helmet that the boy has crafted. Ned notes that the unfinished helm is expertly shaped and\\noffers to buy it. Gendry immediately grabs the helmet back, insisting it is not for sale. Mott rushes to offer apologies\\nfor Gendry’s behavior, but Ned states there is nothing to forgive.\\nNed asks Gendry what he and Jon Arryn talked about. Gendry explains that Lord Arryn asked about his age, if he\\nwas well treated, and about his mother. Ned asks about the boy’s mother as well, and is told that she is dead, but that\\nshe was an alehouse wench with blonde hair. Ned examines Gendry and notices a remarkable resemblance to a\\nyounger King Robert, especially his black hair and blue eyes.\\nNed asks Mott who paid the boy’s apprentice fee. Mott claims he took the boy on for free since he was so strong.\\nNed does not believe this for a moment. Mott admits that an unknown lord had paid twice the normal apprentice fee\\nfor Gendry and said the extra money was for his silence. Ned decides he likes Tobho Mott. Before he leaves, Ned\\ntells Mott to send Gendry to him if the day comes that he wants to wield a sword instead of forge one. Ned also\\nquips that if he ever wants a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place he visits.\\nAs he rejoins his guards outside, Ned still doesn’t understand what Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s bastard, nor why\\nit led to his death.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard V\\n↑\\nJon IV\\n ←\\nEddard VI\\n→ \\nCatelyn V\\n↓\\nEddard VII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 28: Catelyn V\\nPlace(s): \\nCrossroads Inn\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn IV\\n↑\\nEddard VI\\n ←\\nCatelyn V\\n→ \\nSansa II\\n↓\\nCatelyn VI\\nCatelyn\\n and Ser \\nRodrik\\n take shelter from the rain at the \\ninn at the crossroads\\n.

Tyrion recognizes Catelyn, who had hoped to remain anonymous, and Catelyn takes this opportunity to\\nconvince the men in the room to take Tyrion captive so he can face the king’s justice in \\nWinterfell\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nCatelyn\\n and Ser \\nRodrik\\n are on the \\nkingsroad\\n, headed north to \\nWinterfell\\n. It is raining and Ser Rodrik suggests\\nCatelyn should cover her head to keep from taking a chill. Catelyn, however, enjoys the feel of the rain on her face\\nand replies that it is only water. The warm southern rain reminds Catelyn of her childhood with \\nEdmure\\n, \\nLysa\\n, and\\nLittlefinger\\n at \\nRiverrun\\n. Rains are much less pleasant in \\nthe North\\n.\\nRodrik states it would be good to have a fire and a warm meal. Catelyn tells him that there is an \\ninn at the crossroads\\nonly a short way ahead. Catelyn remembers sleeping there many times when traveling with her \\nfather\\n when she was\\nyoung, when it was run by a fat woman named \\nMasha Heddle\\n. Ser Rodrik reminds her that an inn is too public and\\nthat it might be best to find a small holdfast if they do not want to be recognized. However, when they pass\\nunrecognized by a party of soldiers led by Lord \\nJason Mallister\\n, a bannerman to her father, Catelyn decides they will\\nnot be recognized at the inn.\\nAt the inn, they are met by Masha Heddle, who gives them only a cursory look and tells them there are only two\\nrooms available; she gives them none of the smiles or mention of sweet cakes that Catelyn remembers from her\\ngirlhood. After changing into dry clothes, Catelyn thinks that from the crossroads they could go west to \\nRiverrun\\nwhere she could get advice from her father who has been unwell lately. To the east is the \\nEyrie\\n and her sister; Lysa\\nmight be able to provide some answers, but the road across the mountains is too dangerous. Eventually, Catelyn\\ndecides that it is best to continue north to \\nWinterfell\\n. Once past \\nthe Neck\\n they can get aid from one of the bannermen\\nof \\nHouse Stark\\n. Then she can tell the bannerman to send riders north to \\nRobb\\n with orders to place a watch on the\\nkingsroad.\\nCatelyn turns her thoughts to the reliability of Riverrun’s banners. If it comes to war, Catelyn is sure her father will\\ncall his banners, but she is not sure they will all come. \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n showed how unreliable the river lords can\\nbe, particularly the \\nFreys\\n, who arrived to aid their Tully overlords only after the \\nBattle of the Trident\\n had been won,\\nleaving doubts as to which army they had come to join. Ever since, Catelyn\\'s father has called Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n the\\n“Late Lord Frey\". Other banners—such as the \\nDarrys\\n, \\nRygers\\n, and \\nMootons\\n—fought for King \\nAerys II Targaryen\\n.\\nCatelyn decides she must not let a war erupt.\\nSer Rodrik comes to escort her to dinner, suggesting they must hurry if they are to eat and calling her the customary\\n“my lady.” Catelyn decides it might be safer to pretend they are father and daughter. Rodrik agrees, but in the\\nprocess he calls her “my lady” again, and comments on how old ways die hard when he realizes his mistake.\\nIn the long and drafty common room the benches are crowded with a wide variety of people, but Catelyn doesn\\'t see\\nanyone who might recognize her. Ser Rodrik finds them a place by the kitchen where they are accosted by the singer\\nMarillion\\n, who asks about where they come from and where they are going. Catelyn answers the safest of the\\nquestions, saying they come from \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n. The singer tells them that is his destination for the \\nTourney of the\\n\\nHand\\n. The singer is disappointed when Catelyn has not heard about him, and proceeds to attempt to get paid silver\\nfor a song. Ser Rodrik, believing that any healthy boy would prefer a sword to a lyre, tells him he might have a\\ncouple of coppers but would prefer tossing them down a well to hearing the boy’s howling. The singer then tells\\nhow he was made to sing for kings and high lords. Catelyn asks if Marillion has ever played for Lord Tully. The\\nsinger boasts that a chamber is kept for him at Riverrun and that the young Lord Tully is like a brother. This amuses\\nCatelyn, who knows her brother has hated singers ever since one bedded a girl he liked.\\nIt is then that the door bangs open and the arrival of \\nTyrion Lannister\\n is announced, with a demand for room and a\\nbath for Tyrion. When Tyrion is told that there are no rooms, he announces that his servants can sleep in the stable,\\nand quips that he needs only a small room. When Masha Heddle repeats that there are no rooms, Tyrion takes a gold\\ncoin and flips it into the air. A free rider tells Tyrion he is welcome to his take his room, and Tyrion flips the coin to\\nthe man.\\nTyrion declares that he wants some sort of roast fowl and the best wine sent up to his room, and asks the \\nblack\\nbrother\\n \\nYoren\\n to join him. Marillion the singer stands and offers to sing to Tyrion of his father’s \\nvictory\\n at King\\'s\\nLanding while he dines. Tyrion replies that such a song would surely ruin his supper. He is about to turn away when\\nhis eyes find Catelyn, and he comments that he was sorry to have missed her at Winterfell. Everyone in the inn is\\nastonished, and every eye is turned to Catelyn as she stands.\\nCatelyn decides to play her hand. She asks some of the men-at-arms in the room directly if their lords are true to her\\nfather, Lord Hoster Tully. The \\nBrackens\\n, \\nFreys\\n, and \\nWhents\\n are all represented in the room, and all answer with\\npolite agreement. Tyrion is confused and asks what Catelyn is doing, even sniggering at one of the comments.\\nCatelyn then tells the bannermen that Tyrion, while a \\nguest\\n in her home, sent an assassin to murder \\nher son\\n in his\\nbed. In the name of King \\nRobert\\n and the lords they serve, Catelyn calls upon them to seize Tyrion and return him to\\nWinterfell to await the king’s justice.\\nCatelyn cannot decide which is more satisfying: the sound of a dozen men drawing their swords or the look on\\nTyrion Lannister’s face.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn IV\\n↑\\nEddard VI\\n ←\\nCatelyn V\\n→ \\nSansa II\\n↓\\nCatelyn VI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 29: Sansa II\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa I\\n↑\\nCatelyn V\\n ←\\nSansa II\\n→ \\nEddard VII\\n↓\\nSansa III\\nSansa\\n is enthralled by the \\ntourney\\n, especially the knights. Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n kills a new-made knight named Ser\\nHugh\\n in a joust, and after a victory Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n gives her a rose. During the feast that follows, Prince \\nJoffrey\\n is\\nvery courteous, but afterward he orders \\nthe Hound\\n to escort Sansa back to her chambers. When the Hound notices\\nSansa is avoiding looking at his burned face, he forces her to look and tells her how he acquired it.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa\\n rides to \\nthe Hand\\'s tourney\\n in a litter with \\nSepta\\n \\nMordane\\n and \\nJeyne Poole\\n. The splendor takes Sansa’s breath\\naway, the knights most of all. All of the \\nKingsguard\\n are there in pure white cloaks and armor except Ser \\nJaime\\nLannister\\n, the Kingslayer, who wears his famous gilded armor. The gigantic Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n thunders past like\\nan avalanche. Sansa also spies \\nYohn Royce\\n and whispers to Jeyne that he wears bronze armor that is thousands of\\nyears old, engraved in runes that protect the wearer. Septa Mordane points out Lord \\nJason Mallister\\n in an eagle-\\nwinged helmet and silver-chased indigo armor. The girls giggle at the warrior-priest \\nThoros of Myr\\n until the septa\\ntells them he \\nonce\\n scaled the walls of \\nPyke\\n with a flaming sword. Although frightened by dark-skinned \\nJalabhar\\nXho\\n, when Jeyne sees Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n she states she is willing to marry immediately. The procession carries\\non, with many knights whom Sansa does not know. To Sansa it is better than in the songs.\\nThey watch the tourney from a place of honor. \\nJory Cassel\\n, in drab armor, wins two matches, but loses a well-fought\\nthird match to the freerider \\nLothor Brune\\n when King \\nRobert\\n judges Brune’s lance to have been steadier and better\\nplaced. The other contestants from \\nWinterfell\\n do not fare as well. Sansa and Jeyne both scream sometimes when the\\nriders crash together. Sansa notes that Jeyne often covers her eyes when a rider falls, but knows how a great lady\\nmust act, and draws the approval of Septa Mordane for her composure.\\nThe jousting goes on all day and into the evening. Ser Jaime the Kingslayer rides brilliantly, defeating Ser \\nBarristan\\nSelmy\\n, who has already unhorsed two men thirty and forty years younger than himself. \\nThe Hound\\n and his immense\\nbrother Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n, the Mountain-that-Rides, seem unstoppable. On Ser Gregor’s second joust, his lance\\nrides up and impales Ser \\nHugh of the Vale\\n in the neck, killing him. Ser Hugh, in his shiny new armor, falls not ten\\nfeet from Sansa. Jeyne is so disturbed that she cannot stop crying, forcing Septa Mordane to take her away to regain\\nher composure, but she never returns. Sansa is astonished to find herself unmoved by the death, until she realizes\\nthere will be no songs sung of Ser Hugh.\\nLord \\nRenly Baratheon\\n, a crowd favorite, is unhorsed so violently by the Hound that he seems to fly backwards and\\nthe hard fall breaks a gold antler off his helm. Renly gives the broken antler to the Hound, who merely throws it into\\nthe crowd, which erupts in a riot until Lord Renly restores order.\\nBy the end of the day’s jousting, only four contestants remain: Ser Gregor Clegane, the Hound, Ser Jaime Lannister,\\nand Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n. Sansa is entranced with Ser Loras, who is called the Knight of Flowers and has been giving\\nwhite roses to various ladies in the crowd throughout the day. Finally, Ser Loras gives a red rose to Sansa, telling\\nher, “No victory is half so beautiful as you.” Sansa is mesmerized for a long while until she notices Lord \\nPetyr\\nBaelish\\n above her. He tells Sansa that she has \\nher mother\\n’s hair, touches her cheek, and leaves. The king announces\\nthat the last three jousts will wait for the next day.\\n\\nLater, at the feast, Prince \\nJoffrey\\n sits next to Sansa. He has not spoken to her and she has not dared speak to him\\nsince the \\nfight\\n on the \\nkingsroad\\n. Sansa remembers thinking at first that she hated Joffrey for \\nLady\\n’s death, but later\\nshe rationalized that it is not Joffrey but Queen \\nCersei\\n and \\nArya\\n that are responsible. Now Joffrey is the soul of\\ncourtesy, complimenting her by saying that Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty. Sansa asks if Ser Loras will win,\\nbut Joffrey replies that either his uncle or his hound will defeat him, and that one day he will defeat them all. Joffrey\\nfills her cup with wine, which makes her look at Septa Mordane, but when Joffrey fills the septa’s cup also, Sansa\\nthanks him. He talks to her the rest of the night, making her laugh and helping her eat new foods like snails and trout\\nbaked in clay. She can see that the arm \\nNymeria\\n savaged is still bothering him, but he does not complain.\\nThe king grows louder with each course. Finally, drunk as a man can be, he starts shouting at Queen Cersei, telling\\nher, “No! You do not tell me what to do, woman! I am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I\\nwill fight tomorrow, I will fight!” Everyone stares, but no one interferes, and the queen storms off in silence. When\\nJaime comes to him, the king pushes him away hard, causing Jaime to fall. The king boasts that he can still knock\\nJaime in the dirt and that with his war hammer nobody can stand before him. Jaime replies stiffly, “As you say, your\\ngrace.”\\nJoffrey then tells Sansa it grows late and asks if she needs an escort back. With Septa Mordane asleep at the table,\\nJoffrey calls to the Hound to take his betrothed back to her quarters, and deserts Sansa. The Hound asks Sansa if she\\nexpected Joffrey to escort her back himself and scoffs at the idea. Sansa’s dreamy night has suddenly vanished. She\\ndoes not like the idea of the Hound taking her back to the apartments, but cannot wake Septa Mordane.\\nAs the Hound escorts her back, Sansa cannot stand the sight of his burned face, despite insisting to herself that a true\\nlady would not notice. She compliments the Hound’s riding in the joust, giving him the knightly title “Ser.” He\\nresponds angrily that he is no knight and that he spits on the vows knights take. He tells her that his brother is a\\nknight, and asks if he fulfills her naïve expectations. Sansa, lost for words, can only reply that no one could\\nwithstand Ser Gregor. The Hound merely laughs that Sansa’s septa has taught her well: she is just a pretty little bird\\nreciting the words they taught her. When Sansa tells the Hound that he is frightening her, the scarred man only\\ncontinues his story, insisting that during the tourney his brother noticed Ser Hugh’s improperly fastened gorget and\\npurposely let his lance ride up to kill Ser Hugh.\\nThe Hound then forces Sansa to look at his burned face. When she starts to cry, the Hound tells her how his brother\\nGregor burned his face when he was six for stealing a toy knight. The toy had been nothing to Gregor, who was\\nalready a six-foot-tall squire. He had lifted Sandor bodily up and pressed his face into a brazier. Four years later they\\nhad anointed Gregor with the seven oils, and after his said his vows he was called \\nSer\\n Gregor.\\nSansa now feels sad for the Hound, and is no longer afraid of him. The silence goes on for a long while, and finally\\nshe touches the Hound and assures him that his brother is no true knight. They travel the rest of the way in silence.\\nWhen he has finally delivered her to the corridor outside her bedchamber, Sansa thanks him. The Hound’s only\\nreply is a warning; keep the story about his face a secret or he will kill her.\\nNavigation:\\nSansa I\\n↑\\nCatelyn V\\n ←\\nSansa II\\n→ \\nEddard VII\\n↓\\nSansa III\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 30: Eddard VII\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard VI\\n↑\\nSansa II\\n ←\\nEddard VII\\n→ \\nTyrion IV\\n↓\\nEddard VIII\\nAfter viewing the body of Ser \\nHugh\\n, \\nNed\\n and Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n struggle to convince King \\nRobert\\n not to compete\\nin the melee. \\nThe Hound\\n wins the \\ntourney\\n when he saves the life of the \\nKnight of Flowers\\n. Later, \\nVarys\\n visits Ned\\nto reveal that Robert was meant to die in the melee.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n and Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n see that Ser \\nHugh\\n is taken by the \\nsilent sisters\\n. Barristan Selmy explains that he stood\\nvigil for the fallen knight himself, as the boy had no one else except a mother far away in the \\nVale of Arryn\\n. Ser\\nHugh had been Lord \\nJon Arryn\\n’s squire for four years and had been knighted by King \\nRobert Baratheon\\n after Jon\\nArryn’s death. Ned wonders if the boy was killed on purpose by a \\nLannister\\n bannerman to prevent Ned from\\ninterviewing him.\\nSer Hugh’s armor is new, forged especially for the tourney, and worth good money. Ser Barristan does not know if\\nSer Hugh had even finished paying the smith. Ned replies that the boy paid dearly, and orders the silent sisters to\\nhave the armor sent to the boy’s mother. Ser Barristan continues to walk with Ned and informs him that King \\nRobert\\nintends to fight in the melee. Ned already knows. When Ser Barristan suggests that drunken words are often\\nforgotten in the morning, Ned insists that Robert will remember.\\nAs they approach the king’s pavilion, they hear Robert raging at his squires, \\nTyrek\\n and \\nLancel\\n. When they enter the\\ntent, Robert complains that his squires cannot even put a man’s armor on him properly, but Ned tells him the boys\\nare not at fault—Robert is too fat for his armor. Robert tells Ned in mock anger that he should not call his king fat,\\nand then sends the two squires off to get a breastplate stretcher from Ser \\nAron Santagar\\n. After the squires run out,\\nRobert and Ser Barristan laugh and even Ned smiles at the thought of the boys asking for the non-existent device.\\nNed asks if the two squires are from \\nHouse Lannister\\n. The king admits they are, and Ned notes to himself that there\\nare too many Lannisters around the king. Putting the thought aside, Ned asks about the angry words between the\\nking and his wife. Robert takes this opportunity to complain about \\nCersei\\n’s audacity in telling him he should not\\nparticipate in the melee, and he claims \\nLyanna Stark\\n would not have done such a thing. Ned insists Robert did not\\nreally know Lyanna, and that she would have told him he had no business fighting in the melee. This does not\\ndissuade Robert, who insists that—unlike Ned—he still has juices running in his veins. When Ser Barristan speaks\\nup to explain that no man would dare to strike a king during the melee, Robert is furious and sends Ser Barristan\\naway, but orders Ned to stay and to drink.\\nRobert laments to Ned that he was never so alive as when he was winning the throne or so dead as after it was won.\\nHe declares that Ned or Jon Arryn should have been the king, but Ned reminds Robert that he had the best claim.\\nThe king declares that he had not wanted to marry after Lyanna’s death and that it was \\nJon Arryn\\n who recommended\\nCersei Lannister. Robert admits that Cersei is beautiful, but insists that she is cold and that Jon Arryn was a fool for\\nrecommending the marriage; Robert only agreed to it so he\\'d have the wealth and might of \\nTywin Lannister\\n on his\\nside should \\nViserys Targaryen\\n ever return to claim the throne.\\nRobert also apologizes to Ned for the death of Sansa’s \\ndirewolf\\n, admitting that he is sure \\nJoffrey\\n lied regarding the\\nincident\\n. He continues that he dreams of giving up the crown and becoming a \\nsellsword\\n in the \\nFree Cities\\n, but the\\n\\nthought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear stops him. Robert asks Ned how he could have\\nmade a son like Joffrey. Ned responds hollowly that Joffrey is only a boy and that Jon Arryn often despaired of\\nRobert himself when he was a child. Robert admits this to be true and claims that he turned into a good king. When\\nNed does not respond, Robert declares that Ned could at least say he is a better king than \\nAerys\\n. Ned admits the\\ntruth in that. Robert insists that he and Ned still have many years yet to set things right and make him a good ruler.\\nChanging the subject, Robert asks who Ned believes will win the joust. Robert comments that the \\nKnight of Flowers\\nis a son to be proud of and regales Ned with the story of when the young knight unhorsed \\nJaime Lannister\\n in a\\nprevious tourney. Then the king mentions that \\nRenly\\n has told him about the Knight of Flowers’ lovely, fourteen-\\nyear-old sister \\nMargaery\\n.\\nDuring breakfast, Robert talks with Ned about when they were boys. The stories bring a smile to Ned, who realizes\\nhe is speaking to the Robert he grew up with and if he can prove his accusations this man will listen. The thought of\\nthe downfall of Cersei and Jaime even makes the food taste better, and Ned feels better than he has in a long time.\\nNed arrives at the tourney and sits by his daughter \\nSansa\\n. In the first joust, \\nLittlefinger\\n bets against \\nthe Hound\\n since\\na dog will not bite the hand that feeds it. He loses the bet when the Hound defeats Ser Jaime on the second pass after\\nalmost losing in the first. Sansa tells Ned that she knew the Hound would win, and Littlefinger asks her to tell him\\nwho will win the second match.\\nBy the time they lead Ser Jaime—who can no longer see through his mangled helm—off the field, Ser \\nGregor\\nClegane\\n is in position. He is the biggest man Ned has ever seen, even dwarfing \\nHodor\\n. Ned recalls Gregor as a man\\nof ominous reputation; supposedly he dashed in the skull of the infant \\nAegon Targaryen\\n and boasted that he raped\\nand murdered the boy’s mother Princess \\nElia\\n afterwards. There are also rumors of queer circumstances surrounding\\nthe deaths of two wives, a sister, his father, and the burning of his brother’s face.\\nClegane’s opponent is the slim and elegantly armored Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell, who wears a cape of\\nwoven flowers. After comparing Ser Loras and his opponent, Sansa asks her father to ensure that Ser Loras is not\\nhurt. Ned assures her that the lances are designed to break to prevent injury, but cannot help but think of Ser Hugh.\\nSer Gregor has tremendous difficulty controlling his stallion, while Loras demonstrates his horsemanship on his\\nmare. When the pass begins, Clegane’s mount breaks into a hard gallop immediately, while Ser Loras’ mare charges\\nsmoothly. They meet while Gregor is still struggling with his mount, shield, and lance. Ser Loras\\' lance strikes\\nGregor perfectly, sending him down with his mount. Ser Loras’ lance is not even broken, and the crowd cheers\\nwhen he raises his visor in victory.\\nGregor gets up in a rage, demands his sword, and nearly beheads his horse with a single blow. He then strides\\ntoward Ser Loras and sends the Knight of Flowers to the ground with his first blow. He is about to deliver a killing\\nblow when the Hound intercedes. Gregor sends multiple sword blows toward his brother’s head, but the Hound\\nstops each one, remaining on the defensive. The Hound drops to his knee when he hears the King’s voice over the\\ncrowd. The blow from Gregor passes through air, and finally Gregor comes to his senses, drops his sword, glares at\\nKing Robert, and storms off. In gratitude, Ser Loras forfeits the championship to the Hound, so there is no final\\njoust. The crowd cheers for the Hound for the first time in his life.\\nAs they head towards the archery field, Littlefinger points out that Ser Loras had to know his mare was in heat and\\nthat such a thing would disrupt Ser Gregor’s stallion. A boy named \\nAnguy\\n wins the archery event, and Ned sends\\nAlyn\\n to offer him a position among his guards, but the boy refuses. \\nThoros of Myr\\n, who fights with a flaming sword,\\nwins the melee that starts with nearly 40 men and lasts three hours. When the list of injuries is reported, Ned is\\npleased that Robert did not take part.\\nThat night at the feast, Ned remains more hopeful than he has been in a long while. Robert is in a good humor, the\\nLannisters are nowhere in sight, and even his daughters are behaving. Sansa speaks to \\nArya\\n pleasantly and even asks\\nhow her dancing has gone. Arya happily explains that she is sore all over and shows a nasty bruise on her leg. Sansa\\ndeclares that Arya must be a terrible dancer.\\nLater, Ned examines Arya’s bruise himself while she stands on one leg, at which she has improved. He asks if \\nSyrio\\nForel\\n is being too hard on her, but Arya replies that every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Ned is\\n\\nconcerned, even though Syrio came with an excellent reputation and the \\nBraavosi\\n-style suits Arya’s slim blade. He\\nrecalls finding Arya wandering the castle blindfolded because Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears, nose, and\\nskin. Arya has also been practicing spins and back-flips. Ned offers to have someone else take over her lessons, but\\nArya insists she wants Syrio. Ned knows that any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the basics of sword\\nfighting without the blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping around on one leg, but he also knows there is no use\\narguing with Arya.\\nNed returns to his solar, thinking of what he has learned. He takes out the dagger and wonders why \\nTyrion\\nLannister\\n, or anyone else, would want \\nBran\\n dead. He is sure that Bran’s fall is somehow linked to the death of \\nJon\\nArryn\\n, but the truth eludes him. \\nJory\\n is still in the process of searching the whorehouses, and Ned is sure \\nGendry\\n is a\\nbastard son of Robert. There is also \\nEdric Storm\\n, a bastard Robert was forced to recognize because \\nhis mother\\n was\\nhighborn. He also remembers Robert’s \\nfirst child\\n from when Robert was still a boy himself. Yet no bastard can\\nthreaten Robert’s trueborn children, since bastards have few inheritance rights.\\nA knock at the door brings a stranger, who turns out to be \\nVarys\\n in disguise. Ned is amazed; he has never seen\\nVarys wear anything but silk, velvet, and perfume yet now the eunuch wears coarse-spun clothes, mud-caked boots,\\nand smells of sweat. Ned exclaims that he would never have recognized Varys. The eunuch says this is good\\nbecause he would rather the queen’s spies not know about their meeting either.\\nVarys reveals to Ned that the Lannisters had hoped to kill Robert during the melee. When Ned asks why Cersei\\nwould forbid Robert to compete if she planned to have him killed, Varys points out that the surest way to make\\nRobert compete would be to forbid it. Ned is furious that Varys did not tell him, but soon admits that he would have\\ngone straight to Robert, who would have fought to show his enemies he did not fear them.\\nVarys explains to Ned that there are two sorts of people in the \\nRed Keep\\n: those loyal to the realm and those loyal to\\nonly to themselves. Varys says he now knows Ned to be loyal to the realm because he dissuaded the king from\\nentering the melee. Varys also reveals that Cersei fears Ned because Robert will never harm him, not even at her\\ncommand, whereas Robert would execute Varys in a twinkling at queen’s request since the king has little love for\\nsneaks, spies, and eunuchs.\\nNed argues that Robert must have other friends and that his brothers are surely loyal. Varys replies that hating the\\nqueen and loving the king are not quite the same thing. Varys goes on to say that Ser Barristan loves his honor,\\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger. Varys adds that the Kingsguard are a\\npaper shield: Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n and Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n are the queen’s men, Ser Barristan is old, and the loyalties of\\nthe rest are also suspect. Ned insists that they must warn Robert, but Varys reminds him that without proof they will\\nonly lose. Ned insists that the plotters will try again, and Varys agrees, stating that together they might be able to\\nstop them.\\nAs he rises to leave, Varys reminds Ned to continue treating him with his accustomed contempt. As Varys reaches\\nthe door, Ned asks how Jon Arryn died. Varys tells him that a rare and costly poison called the \\nTears of Lys\\n was\\nused. Varys goes on to say that he suggested a taster, but Lord Arryn refused. When Ned asks who administered the\\npoison, Varys claims that it was probably his squire, Ser \\nHugh\\n, who now lies dead. After \\nLysa\\n left for the \\nEyrie\\n,\\nHugh remained and had the money to buy new armor.\\nAs a final question, Ned asks Varys what Jon Arryn had been doing that led to his murder. Varys replies, \"Asking\\nquestions.\"\\nNavigation:\\nEddard VI\\n↑\\nSansa II\\n ←\\nEddard VII\\n→ \\nTyrion IV\\n↓\\nEddard VIII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 31: Tyrion IV\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nHigh Road\\n on the way to the \\nEyrie\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion III\\n↑\\nEddard VII\\n ←\\nTyrion IV\\n→ \\nArya III\\n↓\\nTyrion V\\nTyrion Lannister\\n finds he is being taken to the \\nEyrie\\n instead of \\nWinterfell\\n, which will fool any attempt to rescue\\nhim.

The mare\\nwas a gift from his brother \\nJaime\\n for his twenty-third name day. The sellsword \\nBronn\\n tells Tyrion that none of them\\nwill go hungry, but Tyrion replies that he does not like eating horse, particularly his own horse. Bronn responds that\\nthe \\nDothraki\\n like horse better than other meats. Tyrion reflects that maybe his horse is the lucky one, since he has\\nmany more cold hard days ahead of him. As he walks away from the sellswords, Tyrion thinks back bitterly to the\\nnight at the \\ninn\\n.\\nWhen they took him captive his guard \\nJyck\\n had gone for his sword, but Tyrion had stopped him, knowing it would\\nonly get them killed. Lady \\nCatelyn\\n showed the wounds on her hands all around, claiming they had been caused by\\nTyrion\\'s dagger during an attack on her son. All the people in the inn, who had been friendly enough before, started\\nscreaming for his death. With only his men Jyck and \\nMorrec\\n to defend him, Tyrion had no choice but to surrender;\\nhis other companion \\nYoren\\n, being of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n, was sworn to take no part in such matters.\\nLady Catelyn stated, often and loudly, that they were taking Tyrion to \\nWinterfell\\n for justice. Tyrion had looked over\\nthe crowd and seen that things were not as bad as they seemed. Of the roughly fifty men in the common room,\\nCatelyn Stark roused only a bare dozen. He announced that anyone who reported his capture to \\nhis father\\n would get\\na rich reward. Ser \\nRodrik\\n then ordered the crowd to remain silent, and had Tyrion struggled not to laugh at the\\nthought that Ser Rodrik was fool enough to believe they would.\\nLady Catelyn then asked for help in bringing Tyrion to Winterfell, and was rewarded with several recruits. As they\\nbundled him out of the inn he was not afraid, sure that they would never get him to Winterfell. Then they pulled a\\nhood over his eyes and made a hard gallop through the rain away from the inn.\\nIt was dawn and the rain had stopped when they finally pulled the hood off and Tyrion saw they were on the \\nhigh\\nroad\\n to the \\nEyrie\\n, not the \\nkingsroad\\n to Winterfell, and lost hope. Any pursuit would be looking in the wrong\\ndirection and these were the lands of the late \\nJon Arryn\\n, and his wife \\nLysa\\n was a \\nTully\\n. What was more galling than\\nthe abduction was that Lady Catelyn had outwitted him.\\nHe was spared the hood after that, and after the second night they no longer bound his hands. Still later, they hardly\\nbothered to guard him at all; there was nowhere for him to go. The terrain was harsh and wild and the road no more\\nthan a stony track, and the mountains contained \\nshadowcats\\n and the dangerous \\nVale mountain clans\\n.\\nAs they travel, Tyrion makes sure to remember the names of all his captors so that he can properly pay them back:\\n“A Lannister always pays his debt.” He has a particular enmity towards the singer \\nMarillion\\n, whom he blames for\\nthe whole mess, and who is currently looking for words that rhyme with “imp” for a song about this adventure.\\n\\nCatelyn, Ser Rodrik, and several others are discussing their situation and the pursuit by the Lannisters when Tyrion\\nbreaks in with the comment that there is small chance that the pursuit will catch them. \\nKurleket\\n snaps that Catelyn\\ndid not ask his views, but Catelyn allows him to speak. Tyrion explains any pursuit will be heading up the \\nNeck\\n, not\\ntowards the Eyrie. He states that they will find no help until they reach the \\nVale\\n, and that at their current pace they\\nwill only lose more mounts, which burdens the others more. The pace could also very likely cause Tyrion’s death,\\nwhich Catelyn obviously does not desire. Catelyn replies that Starks are not murderers, and Tyrion states he is also\\nno murderer. He follows up by telling her that he is not stupid, and would not arm a common footpad with his own\\nblade.\\nFor a moment, Tyrion can see doubt in Catelyn’s eyes, but she asks why \\nLittlefinger\\n would lie. Tyrion replies that\\nlying is in Littlefinger’s nature and mentions how the man often boasts of taking Catelyn’s maidenhood, which\\nCatelyn angrily denies. She calls Tyrion an evil man, but Tyrion calls her a fool, continuing on to say that\\nLittlefinger only loves Littlefinger and was only interested in sex with her. Kurleket puts a knife to Tyrion’s throat\\nand asks if he can bleed him, but Catelyn again tells him to let Tyrion talk. Tyrion asks how Littlefinger claims he\\nobtained the blade. Catelyn explains that he won the dagger from Littlefinger at the tourney where the \\nKnight of\\nFlowers\\n unhorsed his \\nbrother\\n.\\nThe cry of a lookout interrupts them, alerting them to incoming riders, and Catelyn immediately arranges the\\ndefense. Tyrion screams to Catelyn to arm him and his serving men, because she will need every man. Both he and\\nCatelyn know that the mountain clans—who are perfectly happy to slaughter each other—will slaughter Lannister\\nand Stark alike. \\nLharys\\n slides down the ridge with the news that there are around 25 men: Milk Snakes or Moon\\nBrothers. Ser \\nWillis Wode\\n asks Marillion for help with his breastplate, but the singer freezes with fear. Instead,\\nMorrec springs to his assistance.\\nTyrion pleads again with Catelyn, insisting that she cannot afford to waste men guarding them. At her request, he\\ngives his word that he will put down the weapons when the fight is finished, and she orders them armed. Morrec\\narms himself with a bow, being better with it than a sword, and Bronn offers Tyrion a double-bladed axe. When\\nTyrion comments on his inexperience with an axe, Bronn tells him to pretend he is splitting logs.\\nTyrion joins Marillion in his hiding place. Marillion whines that he is a singer and wants no part of the fight, but\\nTyrion forces his way in. The clansmen boil into sight, armed with a wide variety of weapons and led by a towering\\nman in a \\nshadowskin\\n cloak armed with a greatsword. The knights and sellswords meet the charge. As the others\\nshout “Winterfell” and “\\nHarrenhal\\n”, Tyrion has to repress an urge to stand up and shout \"\\nCasterly Rock\\n”. From his\\nhiding spot, Tyrion sees Bronn charge through the clansmen, cutting through foes right and left, while Ser Rodrik\\nhammers the leader. Marillion shrieks when a rider leaps over them. When the rider turns, Tyrion charges and cuts\\nthe horse’s neck so that the rider and his horse fall together on top of Marillion. Tyrion then buries his axe in the\\nman’s neck and uses this opportunity to crush Marillion’s fingers with a boot.\\nFor the rest of the battle, Tyrion keeps on the fringes, leaping out to cut at the legs of horses and kill wounded men,\\ntaking a helm from one. Tyrion watches Jyck get himself killed, then comes across Kurleket’s body and helps\\nhimself to the man’s dagger. Then he hears a woman scream. Tyrion goes to aid Lady Catelyn even as he thinks that\\nhe should let them have her. Tyrion gets the first man in the knee and Catelyn kills a second as he reels from a blow\\nby Tyrion. The third man makes a quick retreat, and the fighting is over.\\nAs Bronn helps himself to Jyck’s boots, he asks if this is Tyrion\\'s first fight, which Tyrion confirms. Bronn then tells\\nhim that he needs a woman now; nothing like a woman after a man’s been bloodied. Glancing over to Lady Catelyn,\\nwho is dressing Ser Rodrik’s wound, Tyrion quips that he is willing if she is.\\nLooking over the dead clansmen, Tyrion notes that they are thin, ragged men with unimpressive weapons. The\\nleader in the shadowskin cloak is not near as big or terrifying as he seemed now that the cloak is gone, and his great\\nsword turns out to be notched and poorly made. They have only three dead: the \\nBracken\\n men-at-arms \\nMohor\\n and\\nKurleket, and Tyrion’s man Jyck. Tyrion remembers Jyck’s bareback charge and thinks of him as a fool to the end.\\nSer Willis Wode urges that they must proceed in haste before more clansmen arrive, but Lady Catelyn wishes to\\npause to bury the dead. When Ser Willis points out that the soil is too stony for graves Catelyn suggest they gather\\nstones for cairns. Bronn tells Catelyn that she can do as she likes, but that he and Chiggen have better things to do\\nthan pile rocks, such as breathing. When Ser Rodrik agrees with Bronn, an angry Lady Catelyn agrees and they ride\\n\\non. Now there are plenty of horses. As Tyrion mounts Jyck’s horse, Lharys demands the dirk Tyrion took from\\nKurleket’s body, but Catelyn intercedes, telling them to give him back his axe as well.\\nTyrion is pleased to learn that Marillion the singer has broken several ribs, four fingers, and lost his harp. Tyrion is\\nless pleased to find Marillion has also acquired the magnificent shadowskin cloak. The singer, for once, has nothing\\nto say, and Tyrion can see him cringe when they hear shadowcats fighting over the bodies they left behind. He trots\\nup to the singer and taunts that “craven” rhymes nicely with “raven.” Then he moves up to ride next to Lady\\nCatelyn. Picking up the conversation from before their interruption, Tyrion points out that there is a serious flaw in\\nLittlefinger’s story: he \\nnever\\n bets against his family.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion III\\n↑\\nEddard VII\\n ←\\nTyrion IV\\n→ \\nArya III\\n↓\\nTyrion V\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 32: Arya III\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya II\\n↑\\nTyrion IV\\n ←\\nArya III\\n→ \\nEddard VIII\\n↓\\nArya IV\\nArya\\n is chasing a cat when \\nMyrcella\\n and \\nTommen\\n discover her. She escapes unidentified, but finds herself in the\\ndungeons. There she overhears two men talking about killing \\nher father\\n. After eventually finding her way out she\\ntries to tell her father what she heard but he does not believe her.\\nSynopsis\\nArya\\n is chasing a one-eared \\nblack tomcat\\n as part of her training with \\nSyrio Forel\\n. Arya has found that catching cats\\nis hard; half-healed scratches cover her hands and her knees are scabbed from tumbles. At first, even the fat kitchen\\ncat could avoid her. As she stalks the black tom, Arya recalls when she originally went to Syrio with her hand\\nbleeding. He told her she was too slow and that her enemies would give her more than scratches. The castle is full of\\ncats, all of which she has caught and brought to Syrio, except for this one, which a \\ngold cloak\\n claimed was older\\nthan sin and twice as mean; it had even snatched a quail from Lord \\nTywin\\n’s fingers once. Arya has chased the cat all\\nover the castle and she does not know where she is, but she has finally cornered the cat in a narrow alley.\\nThe tomcat tries to dart between her legs, but Arya catches it. As she excitedly hugs the cat to her chest and gives it\\na kiss, she is interrupted. Princess \\nMyrcella\\n, at the end of the alley, asks what “that boy” is doing with that cat. With\\nher are a couple of the Lannister household guards, a septa, and Prince \\nTommen\\n. She asks again, and calls Arya a\\nragged boy, which Tommen agrees with. Arya pauses a moment to look at her ragged clothing (you don’t wear silks\\nand skirts when catching cats). To avoid being recognized, Arya falls to one knee. The septa tells her that she does\\nnot belong in this part of the castle. Arya is sure that as soon as she speaks the children will recognize her. The septa\\ntells the guards to bring Arya to her. Arya panics and escapes the grasp of the guard, runs over the prince, and avoids\\nthe other guard. After a short chase, Arya sees a window above her, not much more that an arrow slit wide. She\\nleaps up, grabs the sill, and pulls herself through, holding her breath to get through.\\nArya continues her rush, ending up lost in a dark cellar and thinking of the trouble she will be in if she was\\nrecognized. After listening for a long time, she hears no pursuit. She remembers her nightmares of getting lost in the\\nRed Keep\\n, even though her father had told her it was smaller than \\nWinterfell\\n. Arya plans to count to 10,000; by then\\nit will be safe to come out.\\nBy the time she reaches 87, Arya can make out the large shapes of monsters all around her. Initially she is afraid, but\\nshe soon overcomes her fear and makes her way over to touch one of the monsters. She can tell it is bone and that it\\nis dead, but has a feeling that it knows she is there and that it does not love her. She backs into a larger one and\\nwhirls around, causing a tooth to rip her leather jerkin. She runs, avoiding a larger monster, and dashes through the\\njaws of another to find a door. She opens it enough to slip through into the even darker hall beyond. She remembers\\nthat a \\nWater Dancer\\n can see without eyes. As she proceeds down the hall by feeling the walls, Arya remembers that\\nall hallways lead somewhere. Then she hears noises and sees a dim flickering light, which allows her to see that she\\nis above a well with steps leading down.\\nArya can see two men coming up the well and hears the echo of their voices, one of which is thick with the accent of\\nthe \\nFree Cities\\n. She quickly discovers that the men are talking about \\nher father\\n when one explains to the other that\\nthe \\nHand\\n will soon learn the truth. When the second man asks what the Hand will do with the truth, the first replies\\nthat only the gods know, because the Hand is not a man to put aside the attempt on \\nhis son\\n’s life and that soon \\nthe\\n\\nwolf\\n and \\nthe lion\\n will be at each other’s throats. The other man insists that a war now would do no good because\\nthey are not ready.\\nAs the men get nearer, Arya can see more of them. The one bearing the torch is fat with a scarred face and a stubble\\nbeard who moves quietly despite wearing heavy boots and a steel cap. Arya finds him \\noddly familiar\\n but cannot\\nrecognize him. She is sure that she has never met the man with the accent. \\nHe\\n has a forked beard and is grossly fat,\\nyet moves lightly like a Water Dancer.\\nWhen the torchbearer asks what he might possibly do to prevent a war, the fork-bearded man asks, “If \\none Hand\\n can\\ndie, why not a second?” The torchbearer insists that times have changed and that the current Hand is not like the\\nother. The fork-bearded man insists that they need more time: \\nthe princess\\n is with child and the \\nkhal\\n will not bestir\\nhimself until his son is born.\\nThe torchbearer insists that if the \\nkhal\\n does not bestir himself soon it may be too late, because there are new players\\nin the game. \\nStannis Baratheon\\n and \\nLysa Arryn\\n are rumored to be marshalling their strength, Lord \\nRenly\\n and the\\nKnight of Flowers\\n plan to make \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n King \\nRobert\\n’s new queen, and no one knows what \\nLittlefinger\\n is\\nplaying at. Yet the torchbearer insists that Eddard Stark worries him the most; he now has \\nthe book\\n and \\nthe bastard\\nand soon the truth. \\nHis wife\\n has also taken \\nthe Imp\\n prisoner and \\nJaime\\n and Lord \\nTywin\\n will take this for an outrage.\\nThe torchbearer claims that, even with his skill, he cannot keep control much longer, but does agree to do what he\\ncan, saying he requires more gold and 50 more “birds.” The forked beard responds that 50 is a lot, given that they\\nare so young to know their letters. He suggests that if they could keep their tongues it would be easier, but the\\ntorchbearer replies that the risk is too great.\\nArya follows the two men for a long time, going deeper and deeper down the hall until dirt and timbers replace the\\ndressed stone. After miles of following, the men are gone and Arya, blind and lost, can see no way to go but\\nforward. At the end she is knee deep in stinking water, and eventually, she finds herself at the mouth of a sewer that\\nempties into the river. She is so dirty and stinky that she removes her clothes and swims until she feels clean. When\\nshe looks around, Arya can see the Red Keep on its hill, miles away.\\nWhen she finally reaches the gate to the Red Keep and asks to be let in, the two gold cloaks on guard sneer at her\\nbecause she looks like a beggar. She tells them she is not a beggar, she lives there, and she wants to see her father.\\nOne of the guards jokes that he wants to fuck the queen for all the good it does him. When Arya insists her father is\\nthe Hand of the King, one of the guards tries to strike her, but she jumps away and insists she is Arya Stark and that\\nif they lay a hand on her their heads will end up on spikes. She offers that if they need proof of who she is \\nJory\\nCassel\\n or \\nVayon Poole\\n can vouch for her. She finishes by asking the startled guardsmen if they will open the gate or\\nneed a clap on the head to improve their hearing.\\nArya is brought to her father in his solar by \\nTomard\\n and \\nHarwin\\n. He is bent over the biggest book Arya has ever\\nseen. As he hears the report, his face is stern. He then tells her that he had half his guard searching for her, and that\\nshe is not supposed to go beyond the gates without his leave. She replies that she was in the dungeons, and they\\nturned into tunnels, she did not have a light, and she could not go back the way she came because of the monsters.\\nShe then continues to say that two men were talking about killing him. They said that he had a book and a bastard,\\nand if one Hand could die, why not another. Ned is confused. Arya describes the two men, and that they said that the\\nwolf and lion would eat each other. Everything mixes up in Arya’s head. She tells her father that she thinks one was\\na wizard. She decides not to mention knocking over the prince, and how she went into a window and found\\nmonsters. Ned confirms that the men were talking about juggling and mummers, and tells her that they must be\\nmummers and that there must be a dozen troupes in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n now. Arya tries to tell him that they were not\\nmummers, but he interrupts her, saying she should not be spying on people. Then he states he does not want his\\ndaughter crawling through strange windows going after stray cats and notes all the scratches on her arms. He\\ncontinues by stating this has gone on long enough and that he wants a word with Syrio. The announcement of an\\narrival from the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n interrupts their conversation.\\nYoren\\n is ushered in and Ned greets him pleasantly despite his being stooped, ugly, smelly, and in unwashed clothes.\\nYoren apologizes for the hour, and states that Ayra has the look of Ned’s son. Arya replies that she is a girl, and then\\nasks about her brothers since she assumes Yoren must have come by way of \\nWinterfell\\n, and if he can deliver a letter\\nto Jon, thinking Jon will believe her story of the men in the dungeon. Yoren explains to Ned that he is there to find\\n\\nmen for \\nthe Wall\\n, but he has other news, news that should be told in private. Ned tells \\nDesmond\\n to show Arya to her\\nroom. She tries to confirm that nothing bad has happened to \\nJon\\n or \\nher uncle\\n, and Yoren tells her that Jon is fine.\\nAs Desmond takes her to her room, Arya asks him how many guards her father has. He answers 50. Then Arya\\nwants assurance that they will not let anybody kill her father, so Desmond tells her that they guard him day and\\nnight. Arya mentions that the Lannisters have many more men, and he answers that a northerner is worth 10\\nsoutherners. When she asks about wizards, he says a wizard dies the same as anyone else when you cut his head off.\\nNavigation:\\nArya II\\n↑\\nTyrion IV\\n ←\\nArya III\\n→ \\nEddard VIII\\n↓\\nArya IV\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 33: Eddard VIII\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard VII\\n↑\\nArya III\\n ←\\nEddard VIII\\n→ \\nCatelyn VI\\n↓\\nEddard IX\\nNed\\n and King \\nRobert\\n argue over a plot to kill \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n. When the \\nsmall council\\n also sides against him,\\nNed resigns in protest. As Ned prepares to return to \\nWinterfell\\n, \\nLittlefinger\\n arrives with news that he has identified\\nthe \\nbrothel\\n that \\nJon Arryn\\n and \\nStannis Baratheon\\n visited.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n is trying to dissuade King \\nRobert\\n from sending men to kill \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n, now that \\nVarys\\n has received\\nreports of her pregnancy. Robert wants every \\nTargaryen\\n dead and grows very angry with Ned’s resistance. Ned\\ninsists that even if the report is true a lot can happen before the child is old enough to be a threat; the mother might\\nmiscarry, or the child might be born female or die in infancy. Ned also proclaims that he will only fear the \\nDothraki\\nwhen they teach their horses to run on water.\\nRenly\\n comments that it was a mistake to allow \\nViserys\\n and Daenerys to live this long. Ned insists that mercy is\\nnever a mistake, pointing out that at the \\nBattle of the Trident\\n Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n slew a dozen friends of both Ned\\nand Robert, yet Robert absolved him and appointed him \\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard\\n. Robert insists that it is\\nnot the same; Ser Barristan was a knight of the \\nKingsguard\\n. Ned counters that Daenerys is a 14-year-old girl and\\nasks why they overthrew \\nHouse Targaryen\\n if not to end the murder of children. Robert growls that it was to put an\\nend to Targaryens.\\nWhen Ned questions how a man who never feared \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n can tremble at the shadow of an unborn child,\\nKing Robert bellows that he has heard enough and asks for a vote. The other councilors all side with the king except\\nfor Ser Barristan who states that there is no honor in killing an enemy in his mother’s womb.\\nWith the decision made, Robert turns to the topic of how best to carry out the assassination. Renly suggests that Ser\\nJorah Mormont\\n, who craves a royal pardon, might be of use. Varys reminds them all that Ser Jorah is unlikely to risk\\nthe punishment the Dothraki would inflict on the murderer of a \\nkhaleesi\\n. Instead, the eunuch proposes the alternative\\nof \\npoison\\n, such as the \\nTears of Lys\\n; \\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n need never know it was not a natural death.\\nThe mention of the Tears of Lys seems to awaken Grand \\nMaester\\n \\nPycelle\\n from his drowsiness and Robert\\ndenounces poison as a coward’s weapon. Ned remarks on the hypocrisy of debating an honorable way to assassinate\\na 14-year-old and declares that Robert should do the killing himself, the honorable way among the \\nFirst Men\\n. Robert\\nis astounded when he realizes that Ned actually means what he has just said.\\nNed refuses to participate further, declaring that Robert can do as he likes but that he will have no part of it. Robert\\ndeclares that, as \\nHand\\n, Ned will do as commanded or be replaced by a Hand who will. Ned wishes luck to his\\nreplacement and removes his badge of office, declaring that he thought Robert was a better man. As Ned marches\\naway, the king calls after him that he will have Ned’s head on a spike if he ever sees him again. Before Ned has\\neven left, the council resumes the discussion and Ned overhears Pycelle telling the others of a society of assassins in\\nBraavos\\n called the \\nFaceless Men\\n. Littlefinger counters that they can hire an army of \\nsellswords\\n for a fraction of the\\nprice.\\nNed returns to the \\nTower of the Hand\\n and summons \\nVayon Poole\\n to discuss arrangements for their return to\\n\\nWinterfell\\n. Ned is disturbed that Robert still hates the long dead Rhaegar Targaryen so much. Then Ned thinks about\\nwhat will happen when the king discovers that \\nCatelyn\\n has taken \\nTyrion Lannister\\n captive. The king may not care\\nfor the Imp, but it will hurt his pride, and \\nCersei\\n will whisper in his ear. With these thoughts, Ned decides that it\\nmight be safest if he and the girls go ahead, and the rest can follow.\\nAfter Poole leaves, Ned reflects that it will be wonderful to be back at Winterfell with his sons, but he remains angry\\nbecause the kingdom is in a crisis: Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers will beggar the realm, or sell it to\\nthe Lannisters. Then there is the murder of \\nJon Arryn\\n. Ned considers taking a ship back to Winterfell, even though\\nhe would prefer the \\nkingsroad\\n, so that he can stop at \\nDragonstone\\n and maybe learn the truth from \\nStannis Baratheon\\n.\\nThe more he thinks about it, the more Ned guesses the truth is a secret he may not want to know. He looks again at\\nthe assassin’s dagger and wonders if it has some connection to the mystery of Arryn’s death. Could Robert be part of\\nit? He remembers Catelyn telling him that he knew the man but the king is someone different. Ned summons Poole\\nback and tells him to find a fast ship with a good captain, quietly but quickly; if he could find a ship tomorrow, it\\nwould be best to be on it.\\nTomard\\n announces the arrival of Littlefinger. Ned is tempted to send him away, but thinks better of it. Littlefinger\\ninforms Ned that he has managed to convince the council to offer a lordship to any man who kills Daenerys rather\\nthan hire the Faceless Men. When Ned criticizes the principle of giving titles to assassins, Littlefinger points out that\\nhe actually did Daenerys more good than Ned did; if a \\nFaceless Man\\n were to be sent against the girl she would be as\\ngood as buried, whereas this way some idiot will likely botch the job and put the Dothraki on their guard.\\nNed is incredulous; Littlefinger supported the proposal but now expects him to believe that he was defending the\\ngirl. Littlefinger then calls Ned an enormous fool who rules like a man dancing on rotten ice. Ned insists that he has\\nhad his fill of politics. Littlefinger then says that if Ned is still in the city this evening he will take him to the \\nbrothel\\nhis men have been searching for so ineffectually.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard VII\\n↑\\nArya III\\n ←\\nEddard VIII\\n→ \\nCatelyn VI\\n↓\\nEddard IX\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 34: Catelyn VI\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nBloody Gate\\n - The \\nEyrie\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn V\\n↑\\nEddard VIII\\n ←\\nCatelyn VI\\n→ \\nEddard IX\\n↓\\nCatelyn VII\\nCatelyn\\n and her party finally reach the \\nBloody Gate\\n and safety. At her sister’s request, Catelyn makes the dangerous\\nnight ascent to the \\nEyrie\\n to meet \\nLysa\\n and her sickly son, \\nRobert\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nAs they approach the \\nBloody Gate\\n, Ser \\nDonnel Waynwood\\n tells \\nCatelyn\\n that she should have sent word before\\ncoming because the \\nhigh road\\n is no longer safe. Catelyn replies that they learned that to their sorrow, reflecting on\\nthe six men who died to bring her this far; three in the \\nfirst attack\\n, \\nLharys\\n and \\nChiggen\\n in the second, and \\nMorrec\\n of\\na festering wound. Only Ser \\nRodrik\\n, \\nBronn\\n, \\nMarillion\\n, Ser \\nWillis Wode\\n, \\nTyrion Lannister\\n, and Catelyn herself\\nremain. They had been sure they were all doomed when Waynwood’s men approached.\\nSer Donnel goes on to explain that since \\nJon Arryn\\n’s death the \\nVale mountain clans\\n have grown bolder and Lady\\nLysa\\n has forbade sending men out to fight them, though no one is sure why. Catelyn chooses not to mention that it is\\nLannisters\\n her sister fears. Looking back at Tyrion, Catelyn notes the dwarf’s confidence in the presence of a large\\nparty of men sworn to \\nHouse Arryn\\n and wonders again if she is wrong to suspect him. She is also unsettled by the\\ncunning of the man; although he remains her prisoner, the dwarf now rides freely, armed with a dirk and an axe and\\nwearing the \\nshadowskin\\n cloak he won gambling with Marillion.\\nCatelyn asks Ser Donnel to send for \\nMaester\\n \\nColemon\\n when they arrive to treat a badly injured Ser Rodrik. She is\\ntold that her sister has forbidden the maester to leave the \\nEyrie\\n because of her concern for her son \\nRobert\\n’s health.\\nAll that Ser Donnel can promise is the attention of a \\nsepton\\n who tends to the garrison.\\nWhen they arrive at the Bloody Gate, they are met by Catelyn’s uncle, Ser \\nBrynden Tully\\n, known as the Blackfish.\\nOnce they have passed through the Gate, Catelyn can see the richness of the \\nVale of Arryn\\n spread out before her and\\nthe peak known as the \\nGiant\\'s Lance\\n rising miles above the valley floor. Her uncle points out the faint glimmer of\\nthe seven towers of the Eyrie on the side of the mountain and says that they can reach the foot of the Lance by\\nevening.\\nWhen Ser Rodrik declares that he cannot go any farther, Catelyn decides to leave the rest of her party behind.\\nMarillion the singer asks to accompany her to the castle. Catelyn, who cannot understand how Marillion survived\\nthe journey which killed so many others, agrees. Then Bronn, whose ferocious fighting helped cut their path to\\nsafety, declares that he is also coming. Catelyn dislikes the sellsword because of his lack of kindness and loyalty,\\nand would prefer to separate the sellsword from his fast friend Tyrion Lannister. However, Catelyn cannot politely\\nrefuse after permitting Marillion to come and agrees.\\nAs they travel, the Blackfish rides next to Catelyn. Catelyn recalls that her uncle was close to all the \\nTully\\n children\\nand even \\nPetyr Baelish\\n when they were children despite a long feud with their father, Lord \\nHoster\\n. It had been in\\ndefiance of Lord Hoster naming him the black goat of the Tully flock that Ser Brynden had taken a black version of\\nthe Tully fish as his personal sigil. Catelyn recalls that the feud ended after the dual wedding of Catelyn and Lysa to\\nEddard Stark\\n and Jon Arryn, when the Blackfish left \\nRiverrun\\n to serve Jon Arryn in the Vale.\\nAfter Catelyn finishes explaining her story, her uncle says her father must be warned, since Riverrun is right in the\\n\\npath of any Lannister attack. When Catelyn asks what the mood of the Vale is, he tells her that there is anger at the\\nsuspicious death of the much-loved Lord Jon and the giving of the title of \\nWarden of the East\\n to \\nJaime Lannister\\n.\\nLysa has instructed everyone to call young \\nRobert Arryn\\n the “True Warden of the East.”\\nThe Blackfish also gives Catelyn the dire news that the young Lord Robert is unhealthy and cries when his dolls are\\ntaken away, leading some to whisper that he is too weak for the seat. Some even suggest that \\nNestor Royce\\n, who\\nruled as High Steward while Jon Arryn was serving as \\nHand of the King\\n, should rule until Robert comes of age.\\nOthers believe that Lysa should remarry, but the Blackfish thinks she is just playing at courtship and intends to rule\\nherself.\\nWhen Catelyn states that a woman can rule as wisely as a man, the Blackfish replies that the right woman can, but\\nnot Lysa. He explains that the death of her husband and the stillborn and miscarried children before that have left\\nLysa unstable and hysterically protective of her only child. Above all, Lysa seems to fear the Lannisters and now\\nCatelyn has brought a Lannister to her doorstep. Catelyn insists that Tyrion is her prisoner. In reply, her uncle notes\\nthat Tyrion is not only not in chains but also carrying weapons with a sellsword trailing him like a shadow. Catelyn\\nreminds him that Tyrion is not here by choice and that it was Lysa’s letter that started the whole business.\\nAfter passing through a valley surrounded by the high mountains, they reach the \\nGates of the Moon\\n. Well above the\\ngatehouse, Catelyn can see the looming mass of the mountain and high above the tower keeps of Stone, Snow, Sky,\\nand then the Eyrie. Tyrion jests that if they plan to make him climb the mountain at night they might as well just kill\\nhim now. He is told that they will rest until morning.\\nWhen the dwarf asks how one gets up, he is told there are steps leading up the mountain and trained mules that go as\\nfar as the way-castle called Sky. Beyond that the ascent is made on foot or in the winch baskets that bring up\\nsupplies—the Eyrie is directly above Sky. Tyrion declines the offer of being sent up in a basket because his father\\nwould not approve of him going up like a load of turnips if the others ascend on foot, claiming that Lannisters have a\\ncertain pride. Catelyn responds that Lannisters have arrogance, avarice, and lust for power. Tyrion replies that his\\nfather\\n is the soul of avarice, Jaime has pride, and \\nCersei\\n lusts for power, but he is innocent as a lamb and will bleat\\nfor her.\\nThe portcullis is raised and they are met by Lord Nestor Royce. Brynden asks for hospitality for the night, and is\\ntold that Catelyn has been instructed to go up tonight, but the rest can have the hospitality of the castle. Brynden is\\nfurious, considering night ascent to be too dangerous without a full moon. The guide \\nMya Stone\\n then introduces\\nherself and promises that no harm will come to Catelyn, citing her experience on a hundred night ascents. Stone is\\nthe surname of bastards in the Vale and that reminds Catelyn of \\nJon\\n. She is speechless, but Lord Nestor states that\\nMya has never failed him, and so Catelyn agrees to the night ascent.\\nMya Stone guides Catelyn up the long path to the Eyrie in the dark, claiming that torches only blind one on a clear\\nnight. Mya then tells Catelyn that \\nMychel Redfort\\n, a squire she loves, says she has the eyes of an owl. Catelyn\\nknows that, because his family is highborn, the squire will never be allowed to marry a \\nbastard\\n.\\nAt each way-tower they switch to fresh mules. The trip to the first way-tower does not seem too bad, but the next\\npart is much steeper. At the next way-tower Mya explains that it is called Snow because, hundreds of years ago, this\\nwas where the snow began. At first Catelyn thinks that, as a Tully and a Stark, there is little in the world to scare her.\\nHowever, when they must lead the mules across a high saddle between to spires of rock, Catelyn finds that she is too\\nscared to move. Mya comes back and escorts her, blind and trembling, step by step across. At Sky, Mya explains\\nthat they must walk the last hour because the trail is more like a stone ladder. Catelyn states that, having travelled all\\nday and the best part of a night, she will ride with the turnips instead.\\nCatelyn finds the Eyrie, which can house 500 men, strangely empty. She is brought to her sister’s quarters. Lysa,\\nnow a plump, pale, and (to Catelyn’s annoyance) well-rested woman, is polite until Ser \\nVardis Egen\\n and Maester\\nColemon depart. Then she rages at Catelyn for bringing Tyrion to the Eyrie, and thus dragging her into Catelyn’s\\nquarrel with the Lannisters. Catelyn replies that it was Lysa who sent her the letter naming the Lannisters as the\\nmurderers of her husband. Lysa responds that it was a warning to avoid them, not fight them.\\nRoused by his mother’s voice, young Lord Robert appears in the door, grasping a doll. Lysa introduces Catelyn to\\nRobert and calls him a beautiful and strong child, warning Catelyn not to believe the stories. Lysa insists that on his\\n\\ndeathbed her husband said “the seed is strong” to let everyone know what a strong boy his son was. Catelyn attempts\\nto bring back the subject of preparing for war, but Lysa insists that Catelyn be quiet because such talk will scare\\nRobert. Lysa then exposes her breast and the six-year-old grabs for it and starts to suck.\\nThe sight makes Catelyn think of her youngest son \\nRickon\\n, who is half this boy’s age and five times as fierce.\\nCatelyn continues to press Lysa to discuss preparations for war. Lysa replies that even if the Lannisters could bring\\nan army up, everyone says the Eyrie is impregnable. Catelyn realizes that her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her\\nabout Lysa. Lysa then asks what she is supposed to do with Tyrion and Robert asks if he is a bad man. When Lysa\\nreplies that he is, Robert says, “Make him fly.” Lysa strokes the boy’s hair and muses that perhaps that is just what\\nthey will do.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn V\\n↑\\nEddard VIII\\n ←\\nCatelyn VI\\n→ \\nEddard IX\\n↓\\nCatelyn VII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 35: Eddard IX\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard VIII\\n↑\\nCatelyn VI\\n ←\\nEddard IX\\n→ \\nDaenerys IV\\n↓\\nEddard X\\nLittlefinger\\n leads \\nNed\\n to the \\nbrothel\\n that \\nJon Arryn\\n visited.

As they are returning to the \\nRed Keep\\n, Ned’s party is ambushed by \\nJaime Lannister\\n and\\nabout 20 of his men. In retribution for the \\nabduction\\n of \\nhis brother\\n, Jaime has Ned’s escort killed. Ned’s leg is\\nbroken during the fight, and he loses consciousness.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n finds \\nLittlefinger\\n in the common room of the \\nChataya\\'s brothel\\n talking with an elegant \\nblack-skinned woman\\n.\\nHis guardsman \\nHeward\\n is gambling for the removal of clothes with a whore while \\nJory Cassel\\n watches from the\\nwindow. Ned declares his business done, and Jory moves to bring the horses around while Littlefinger makes a joke\\nabout what part of the king’s anatomy the \\nHand of the King\\n might be filling in for in a brothel. In no mood for\\nLittlefinger’s jokes, Ned gruffly declares he is no longer the Hand. Outside, it is raining as they mount up. As they\\nride the deserted streets, Littlefinger tells Ned that he is considering buying the brothel because brothels make much\\nsounder investments than ships; they do not sink and pirates pay good coin like everyone else.\\nAs they ride back toward the \\nRed Keep\\n in the rain, Ned remembers the night his sister \\nLyanna\\n was betrothed to\\nRobert. Lyanna had told him that Robert would never keep to one bed. Ned, who had already held Robert’s first\\nbastard \\ndaughter\\n, assured her that Robert was a good man who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna responded\\nthat one could not change a man’s nature. After what he has seen this night, Ned cannot say his sister was wrong.\\nNed’s business at \\nChataya\\'s brothel\\n was to meet the prostitute with \\nRobert\\n’s bastard daughter named \\nBarra\\n. The\\nchild resembled Robert, and the girl was proud to show him that the baby had the king’s nose and hair. Ned still\\nremembers that Robert’s firstborn had the same hair. The girl asked him to tell Robert how beautiful their daughter\\nis, that she has not been with anyone else, and that she is waiting for him. Eddard vowed that she and the child\\nwould be well cared for. As he rides, Ned reflects that he is cursed to always keep his promises, while Robert can\\nswear undying love and forget it by the morning.\\nNed thinks about \\nJon Snow\\n and wonders why the gods give men such lust only to frown on bastards. Ned then asks\\nLittlefinger about Robert’s bastards. Littlefinger says he does not know exactly how many there are. He goes on to\\nspeak in detail about Robert’s acknowledged bastard \\nEdric Storm\\n, the son of a \\ncousin\\n to the king’s \\nsister-in-law\\n.\\nLittlefinger also speaks of a rumored pair of twins of a serving maid at \\nCasterly Rock\\n which \\nCersei\\n had killed. Ned\\nis surprised that Robert would stand by and let such a thing happen, but then recalls that Robert seems to have\\ngrown adept at shutting his eyes.\\nNed asks why \\nJon Arryn\\n would suddenly take such an interest in Robert’s bastards. Littlefinger suggests that maybe\\nRobert asked him to. Ned declares that Jon Arryn was killed for something more than that. Littlefinger says\\nscornfully that maybe Lord Arryn had to be silenced for discovering Robert had bastard children, scoffing that next\\nthe man might be audacious enough to claim the sun rises in the east. Ned thinks of \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n for the first\\ntime in years, and wonders if the Dragon Prince frequented brothels; somehow he thinks not.\\nSuddenly they are surrounded by at least 20 \\nLannister\\n guardsmen. \\nJaime Lannister\\n rides up and declares that he is\\nlooking for \\nhis brother\\n who apparently had \\nsome trouble\\n on the road. Ned tells him that \\nCatelyn\\n took Tyrion\\n\\nprisoner to answer for his crimes. This causes Littlefinger to groan in dismay and Jaime to move forward and draw\\nhis sword. Jaime demands that Ned show his steel, declaring that he will butcher Ned but prefers it if Ned will fight\\nback. Jaime then suggests Littlefinger leave if he does not want blood on his expensive clothes. Littlefinger needs no\\nurging, but assures Ned that he will bring the \\nCity Watch\\n.\\nThe Stark guardsmen have drawn their swords, but it is three against twenty, so Ned reminds Jaime that if he dies,\\nCatelyn will kill Tyrion. Jaime doesn’t believe him but is unwilling to chance it, so he tells his men not to harm Ned.\\nYet Jaime refuses to leave Ned entirely unchastened so he orders Ned’s guardsmen killed. Ned and his men are\\nquickly overwhelmed and \\nHeward\\n and \\nWyl\\n are cut down. Jory manages to break free, but returns almost\\nimmediately and is killed. In the confusion, Ned’s horse slips and falls and Ned is blinded by the pain of his leg\\nbreaking.\\nWhen he opens his eyes again, Ned drags himself through the mud.

As they ride up the godsway, \\nDaenerys\\n discusses the pros and cons of Dothraki\\ncombat skills with Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n. Once they have settled in, Daenerys invites \\nViserys\\n to sup with her and\\nmakes a peace offering of new clothes. He becomes angry and grabs her. She hits him hard with a belt and tells him\\nto leave.\\nSynopsis\\nThe \\nkhalasar\\n enters \\nVaes Dothrak\\n under the \\nMother of Mountains\\n and proceeds along the godsway, passing under\\nthe gigantic Horse Gate, a pair of rearing bronze stallions whose hooves meet a hundred feet up. \\nDaenerys\\n wonders\\nwhy Vaes Dothrak needs a gate when it appears to have no walls, no buildings, and no people. All that Daenerys can\\nsee are ancient monuments that the \\nDothraki\\n have sacked over the centuries in the grass on either side of the\\ngodsway.\\nAs she looks back at her brother \\nViserys\\n, who is now mounted again, Daenerys thinks back on the events of the long\\nride east. After the \\nincident\\n on the \\nDothraki Sea\\n, Viserys had been forced to walk and the Dothraki had named him\\nKhal Rhae Mhar\\n, the “Sore Foot King.” Viserys did not realize that he was being mocked when he accepted a ride in\\na cart from \\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n, which earned him another name, \\nKhal Rhaggat\\n, the “Cart King.” Daenerys had begged Ser\\nJorah\\n not to tell Viserys the truth, and only after much pleading had she convinced Drogo to allow Viserys to ride\\nagain.\\nNow, as they ride past the broke idols of fallen cities, Viserys tells Daenerys that all the Dothraki savages can do is\\nsteal things better men have built and kill, which is all he needs them for. He goes on to say the Dothraki cannot\\nspeak the language of civilized men, and then states that he is tired of waiting for Drogo to give him his army. Ser\\nJorah tells Viserys that Drogo will honor his promise in his own time. Fortunately, few of the Dothraki can\\nunderstand the Common Tongue. After Viserys leaves, Ser Jorah explains that the Dothraki are not merchants and\\ndo not trade; despite what Viserys thinks, Khal Drogo considers Daenerys a gift and will eventually give a gift in\\nreturn.\\nDaenerys points out that it is not right to make her brother wait, and says Viserys believes he can sweep the \\nSeven\\nKingdoms\\n with 10,000 Dothraki. Ser Jorah snorts that Viserys could not sweep a stable with 10,000 brooms.\\nDaenerys asks whether it would be possible for someone stronger than Viserys. Ser Jorah tells her that when he first\\ncame to \\nEssos\\n he saw the Dothraki as half-naked barbarians and believed that a thousand good knights could put a\\nhundred times as many Dothraki to flight. Now he is not so sure; the Dothraki are better riders, their bows (wielded\\nfrom horseback) have a longer range, and there are so many of them. Drogo alone commands 40,000 men, the same\\nnumber that \\nRhaegar\\n brought to the \\nBattle of the Trident\\n, and only a tenth of Rhaegar\\'s men were knights. When\\nRhaegar died, many fled the field and such a rabble would not last long against 40,000 Dothraki. However, the\\nDothraki have no patience for siegecraft and if the armies of \\nWesteros\\n stayed behind their castle walls they could\\nhold out forever. \\nRobert Baratheon\\n might be fool enough to give them battle, but the men around him are not:\\nStannis Baratheon\\n, \\nTywin Lannister\\n, and \\nEddard Stark\\n. The way he says the last name leads Daenerys to ask if Ser\\nJorah hates the man. Ser Jorah replies that Eddard Stark took everything he loved from him for a few lice-ridden\\npoachers and his precious honor.\\n\\nThey arrive at the city, which is both the largest and the smallest Daenerys has ever seen; it sprawls ancient,\\narrogant, and empty across the plain. The buildings are all different. Ser Jorah explains that they are built by slaves\\nin the fashion they were familiar with. He also explains that the only permanent residents are the \\ndosh khaleen\\n, the\\nwidows of all the \\nkhals\\n who have come before, yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house all the \\nkhalasars\\n if they\\nshould all return at once, as is prophesized.\\nWhen they near the eastern market and dismount, each rider gives up all his weapons to a waiting slave, for in Vaes\\nDothrak no man may carry steel or spill blood. The palace of Khal Drogo is a massive feasting hall of roughhewn\\nlogs that make a wall 40 feet tall with a roof of silk surrounded by horse yards and hundreds of earthen houses.\\nDaenerys is met by \\nCohollo\\n, one of Khal Drogo’s \\nbloodriders\\n, who informs her that Drogo must ascend the Mother\\nof Mountains that night to sacrifice for his safe return. As she speaks to Cohollo, Daenerys recalls that the \\nkhal’s\\nthree bloodriders are his sworn brothers who share everything with him except his horses. Daenerys is glad that\\nDrogo does not hold to the tradition of sharing \\nher\\n with his bloodriders because some of them frighten her.\\nBloodriders are bound to their \\nkhal\\n for life and die when he dies, living only long enough to avenge him if required.\\nDaenerys finds herself wishing \\nher father\\n was guarded by such men, remembering the stories of \\nthe Kingslayer\\n who\\nmurdered her father and Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n who went over to \\nthe Usurper\\n.\\nDaenerys, who is tiring easily as her child grows, is looking forward to a night of rest. She is led to one of the\\nhollow hills that has been prepared for her. She decides to give her brother his gifts tonight. She has prepared\\nViserys several sets of clothes that she hopes will help him earn the respect of the Dothraki. She also intends the\\ngifts as a way of apologizing for shaming him. Daenerys orders \\nDoreah\\n to invite him to supper and \\nIrri\\n to go to the\\nmarket to buy something other than horse meat, which Viserys hates.\\nViserys soon arrives, dragging Doreah by the arm, furious that Daenerys would presume to give him commands.\\nDaenerys attempts to explain that Doreah misspoke, then shows Viserys the clothes she has had made for him.\\nViserys only sneers at the clothes, calling them Dothraki rags. Her brother goes on to ridicule her for presuming to\\ndress him and suggests spitefully that next Daenerys will want to braid his hair. Daenerys declares that he has no\\nright to a braid because he has won no victories.\\nViserys grabs her by the arm, hurting her, and for a moment Daenerys is a scared little girl again. Then she grabs\\nhold of the first thing she touches, a medallion belt she meant to give Viserys, and swings it with all her strength.\\nThe belt hits her brother full in the face and leaves a deep cut. Daenerys tells Viserys to leave and pray that Drogo\\ndoes not hear of this. Viserys leaves in a fury, telling her that when he comes into his \\nkingdom\\n she will regret this\\nday.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys III\\n↑\\nEddard IX\\n ←\\nDaenerys IV\\n→ \\nBran V\\n↓\\nDaenerys V\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 37: Bran V\\nPlace(s): \\nOutside \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran IV\\n↑\\nDaenerys IV\\n ←\\nBran V\\n→ \\nTyrion V\\n↓\\nBran VI\\nDuring his first ride outside \\nWinterfell\\n since his fall, \\nBran\\n learns of \\nJaime Lannister\\n’s \\nattack\\n on \\nhis father\\n. \\nRobb\\ngoes ahead to find the \\ndirewolves\\n and Bran is attacked by six outlaws. Robb returns with the direwolves and defeats\\nall but one. The last man holds a dagger to Bran’s throat until \\nTheon\\n kills him with an arrow from behind. \\nOsha\\n, the\\nonly survivor, is taken captive.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n is finally getting to ride outside of the castle in the oversize saddle that \\nTyrion Lannister\\n designed for him. He\\nhas been riding a horse he named \\nDancer\\n in the yard for the past fortnight, getting bolder each time. With his legs\\nunable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse makes him unsteady at first, but the straps around his chest and\\nthighs prevent him from falling. Soon Bran gets into the rhythm and his anxiety fades into a tremulous smile.\\nBran would have preferred to have gone out with just \\nRobb\\n, but neither \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n nor the new Captain of\\nGuard, \\nHallis Mollen\\n, would allow it. The party includes Robb, \\nJoseth\\n the Master of Horse, \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n, Maester\\nLuwin, and the \\ndirewolves\\n \\nSummer\\n and \\nGrey Wind\\n. As they pass through the village, Theon calls out to two serving\\nwenches by the ale house. \\nOne\\n blushes and Theon declares to Robb that she squirms like a weasel in bed but blushes\\nif you say anything to her in the street. Before Theon can continue his ribald story, Robb insists he not talk about\\nsuch things around Bran. Bran notes that Robb seems to admire Theon, but Bran has never warmed to him.\\nBran asks to go faster, and Robb agrees and spurs his own horse. Bran brings Dancer to a gallop, and catches up to\\nRobb at the edge of the \\nwolfswood\\n. Bran exclaims his excitement at being able to ride, and Robb smiles, but Bran\\ncan tell something is bothering his brother. Robb notes that something is bothering the direwolves as well before\\nadmitting there was a raven the night before. The news recently from the ravens has not been good: \\nUncle Benjen\\nhas still not been found and \\ntheir mother\\n has taken \\nTyrion Lannister\\n captive. Bran remembers Robb sending riders\\nwith commands throughout the north. Nobody had told him what was happening, but Bran knew it was about the\\nLannisters\\n and not good. There is something about the Lannisters that Bran knows he ought to remember, but when\\nhe tries to think what it is he becomes dizzy and his stomach clenches.\\nRobb explains that the message was from \\nAlyn\\n in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n. \\nHeward\\n, \\nWyl\\n, and \\nJory Cassel\\n have been\\nmurdered\\n by the \\nKingslayer\\n. Bran cannot understand why anyone would kill Jory, whom he remembers chasing him\\nacross the roofs of \\nWinterfell\\n. Robb continues solemnly that their \\nfather\\n’s leg was shattered in the fight and he has\\nnot woken since. Robb promises Bran that he “will not let this be forgotten.” Theon advises Robb to call the\\nbanners. Bran exclaims that only the Lord can call the banners, but Theon replies that if Eddard dies, Robb is Lord\\nof Winterfell. Robb notes to Bran that the honor of \\nthe North\\n is in his hands. Bran asks if Maester Luwin agrees with\\ncalling the banners, and Theon calls the maester as timid as an old woman. Bran tells Robb that their father and\\nmother both listen to the maester’s council; Robb states that he listens to everyone.\\nThe joy of the ride is over and Bran asks if they can go back because he is cold. Robb states that first they need to\\nfind the wolves and the brothers ride into the wolfswood while Theon falls back to talk with a guardsman. Bran\\nenjoys riding his horse in the woods while Theon and the guardsmen fall further behind. When they come to a\\nstream, Robb asks Bran what is troubling him. Bran admits that he remembers Jory bringing them here to fish with\\nJon Snow\\n. Bran asks if they will ever see Jon again and Robb reminds him that even Uncle \\nBenjen\\n came to visit.\\n\\nThen the wolves howl and Robb rides off to get them, asking Bran to stay there.\\nBran is getting anxious about the others when four ragged men and two women surround him. Bran can tell they are\\nneither foresters nor farmers and suddenly he remembers how richly he is dressed. The biggest man asks if he is lost\\nand Bran says that his guard will be along shortly. Bran, seeing their clothes, believes that the rags could be the\\nblack of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n; he remembers that his father said deserters are dangerous because they know their life is\\nforfeit.\\nThe outlaws demand his silver pin and his horse. When Bran tries to explain that he cannot dismount, they do not\\nbelieve him. The big man, whom the others call \\nStiv\\n, grabs the reins before Bran thinks of turning and riding off.\\nFinally, the tall woman, \\nOsha\\n, sees the straps. The short woman named \\nHali\\n asks if he is a cripple. Angered, Bran\\ndeclares that he is Brandon Stark and that they had better let go of his horse or they will be dead. With Bran’s\\narrogant outburst, the gaunt man named \\nWallen\\n proclaims that only a Stark would threaten when a smarter man\\nwould beg. Hali tells the others to cut off his cock and stuff it in his mouth. Osha tells Hali that she is as stupid as\\nshe is ugly; \\nMance Rayder\\n will pay well for a kinsman of \\nBenjen Stark\\n. Stiv states that he does not want to go back\\nto the \\nWhite Walkers\\n, and cuts the strap on Bran’s saddle, cutting Bran’s leg in the process. Bran feels nothing, but\\nstarts to feel light headed.\\nSuddenly Robb calls out for them to surrender. Bran sees that Robb is still mounted, with the body of an elk over the\\nback of his horse. The outlaws only laugh and point out that it is Robb who is outnumbered and should surrender.\\nThen the direwolves appear at Robb’s whistle. Robb charges, killing one of the men and riding down Osha when she\\noverextends with her spear. At the same time \\nGrey Wind\\n kills Wallen and the other unnamed man while Summer\\ntears open Hali’s belly.\\nNow facing Robb and the direwolves alone, Stiv finishes cutting Bran free, hauls him from the saddle, and holds his\\nknife to Bran’s throat. Stiv tells Robb to drop his sword and Robb slowly complies. Then Stiv tells Robb to call the\\ndirewolves off, which Robb does. Bran can see that Osha is still alive. Stiv commands Osha to kill the wolves, but\\nshe refuses to go anywhere near them. Instead, Stiv orders Robb to kill the wolves. Bran screams “No,” knowing\\nthat they will be defenseless without the wolves. Suddenly an arrow from Theon Greyjoy’s bow bursts through\\nStiv’s chest and the man collapses into the stream.\\nThe Stark guardsmen appear and Osha throws down her spear and surrenders. The guardsmen grow pale and some\\neven vomit when they see the carnage. Theon, ever smiling, is proud of his shot, but Robb scolds him for taking\\nsuch a chance with Bran’s life; he might have missed or the knife could have slipped. Then Robb turns on the\\nguardsmen, asking where they were. They explain that at first they were waiting for Maester Luwin and Theon\\nadmits he lead them off to hunt a turkey. Robb is angrier than Bran has ever seen him.\\nAs Maester Luwin examines Bran’s wounds he points out to Robb that two of the attackers wear the black of the\\nNight\\'s Watch. Robb orders their heads cut off for transport back to \\nthe Wall\\n, but orders the bodies left unburied.\\nThe question of what to do with Osha comes up. The woman drops to her knees to beg Robb to spare her,\\nproclaiming that she will serve him. When Robb asks what use he might have for an oath-breaker, Osha insists that,\\nas a \\nwildling\\n, she broke no oaths. Theon suggests that they give her to the wolves, which causes Osha to shudder\\nand even some guardsmen to look queasy. Maester Luwin advises that they question her, so Robb orders her bound\\nand brought back to Winterfell.\\nNavigation:\\nBran IV\\n↑\\nDaenerys IV\\n ←\\nBran V\\n→ \\nTyrion V\\n↓\\nBran VI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 38: Tyrion V\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nEyrie\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion IV\\n↑\\nBran V\\n ←\\nTyrion V\\n→ \\nEddard X\\n↓\\nTyrion VI\\nTyrion\\n is held captive in one of the \\nEyrie\\n’s \\nsky cells\\n.

As always, when\\nTyrion reaches for the plate, the oaf pulls it away and holds it over the edge of the cell, telling Tyrion to come get it.\\nTyrion is unwilling to step that close to the edge and Mord lets the plate fall.

When\\nMord placed Tyrion in the cell he promised that, sooner or later, Tyrion would fly. To make things worse, the floor\\nslants towards the opening, making Tyrion afraid to sleep, lest he slip towards the edge.\\nTyrion remembers when \\nLysa Arryn\\n announced to her court that Tyrion had slain \\nJon Arryn\\n, the \\nHand of the King\\n.\\nThat was when Tyrion put his foot in it, remarking “Oh, did I kill him too.” He went on to wonder aloud when he\\nwould have had enough time to do all this killing. He should have been silent but he had been in a foul mood, having\\nbeen humiliated by having to be carried the last leg of the climb to the Eyrie by \\nBronn\\n. Lysa warned him about\\nwhere he was but he threatened them with the wrath of \\nJaime Lannister\\n all the same. He even declared his threat a\\npromise and drove sickly young Lord \\nRobert Arryn\\n into a frenzy. It was only the intervention of \\nCatelyn Stark\\n that\\nsaved him from being made to fly when she insisted that Tyrion was her prisoner. Then he was sent to the sky cells.\\nTyrion thought that they would not dare kill him out of hand, but now he is not so sure. He is getting weaker every\\nday and it is only a matter of time before Mord’s kicks do him serious harm. He is sure that \\nhis father\\n will have sent\\nriders out by now and Jaime might already be leading an army to rescue him. \\nCersei\\n might get King \\nRobert\\n to sit in\\njudgment himself, which even \\nEddard Stark\\n could not object to. Tyrion is sure he can win a trial since the \\nStarks\\nhave no proof.\\nTyrion wonders which of his siblings sent the footpad to kill \\nBran Stark\\n and if they also conspired in the death of\\nJon Arryn\\n. If Arryn was murdered it was subtly done, whereas sending a footpad to kill Bran was unbelievably\\nclumsy. This leads Tyrion to wonder if there is some other force involved that has made him a pawn; Tyrion hates\\nbeing a pawn.\\nTyrion decides that he must free himself, and soon. He has no chance of overpowering Mord, so he must talk\\nhimself out. Tyrion hammers on the door, yelling for Mord. Mord is furious that Tyrion is making noise. Tyrion,\\nremembering not to show fear, asks if Mord would like to be rich. Mord only strikes him with a leather strap. It\\ntakes a great deal of talking about \\nLannister\\n gold while getting slapped before Mord finally starts to listen. Tyrion\\nexplains that, although she relieved him of his purse, Catelyn Stark would never rob him; therefore the gold is still\\nhis. Tyrion promises all of his gold to Mord in exchange for Mord telling Lysa Arryn that he wishes to confess his\\ncrimes. Tyrion even goes so far as to lie that his brother \\nJaime\\n wears solid gold plate armor (it is actually gilded\\n\\nsteel, but Mord would never know the difference}. When Tyrion senses Mord’s suspicion, he offers to write down\\nthe deal and Mord brings him a pen and paper.\\nTyrion is shivering in his sleep when Ser \\nVardis Egen\\n arrives to bring him to Lysa. Before he leaves, Tyrion asks\\nMord for his shadowskin cloak and Ser Vardis orders the unhappy jailer to hand it over. The High Hall is filled with\\nknights and retainers to hear his confessions. Tyrion is happy to see that young Lord Robert is missing from the high\\nthrone. Tyrion is also pleased to see \\nBronn\\n and \\nMarillion\\n among the witnesses; with a singer present, whatever\\nhappens will not remain a secret.\\nLysa comments to her sister that the sky cells always break prisoners, but Catelyn only says that Tyrion does not\\nappear broken to her. Tyrion declares to himself that the time has come to roll the dice. He starts by declaring\\nhimself a vile little man and that his crimes and sins are beyond counting: whoring, gambling, wishing his own\\nfather and sister dead, and speaking ill of the royal court. Soon he is interrupted by a furious Lysa and Catelyn tells\\nhim pointedly that he is there to confess to the attempted murder of \\nBran Stark\\n and the murder of Jon Arryn. Tyrion\\nmerely replies that he cannot confess to those crimes because he is innocent.\\nLysa orders Tyrion taken back to a smaller sky cell with a steeper floor. Before he can be taken, Tyrion asks loudly\\nif this is how justice is done in the \\nVale\\n: he is accused of crimes, he denies them, and so he is thrown into a cell. He\\nmakes sure to show his bruised face to the crowd. Tyrion demands a trial where he can defend himself and be\\njudged by gods and men. Lysa states that if Tyrion is found guilty, he will go through the “moon door”, which leads\\nonly to a fatal plunge to the mountainside below. Catelyn tells Lysa that this is unwise. Lysa states that her son will\\nhear and judge Tyrion’s trial. Tyrion remembers Lord Robert stating that he wanted to see him fly.\\nTyrion demands a trial-by-combat, which the fills the hall with derisive laughter. There are shouts throughout the\\nhall, with most men asking to be given the honor of championing Lysa Arryn’s cause. Lysa declares that Ser Vardis\\nEgen, the only silent man, will be her champion. Ser Vardis sinks to one knee, but declines the honor, insisting that\\nto slaughter such a defenseless man would be shameful. Tyrion is quick to agree, demanding a champion the same\\nas Lysa and naming his brother \\nJaime\\n. When Lysa refuses Tyrion’s choice on the grounds that Jaime is hundreds of\\nleagues away, Tyrion turns to Marillion to insist that when he makes a ballad of these proceedings he be sure to\\nmention that Tyrion was denied a champion and sent bruised and hobbling against Lysa’s finest knight.

Robert reinstates Ned as \\nHand of the King\\nand declares that Ned must sit the \\nIron Throne\\n because he is going hunting.\\nSynopsis\\nUnder the influence of the \\nmilk of the poppy\\n, \\nNed\\n dreams an old dream of the \\nshowdown\\n at the \\nTower of Joy\\n. In the\\ndream as it was in life, his friends ride with him: \\nHowland Reed\\n, Lord \\nWillam Dustin\\n, \\nEthan Glover\\n, \\nMartyn Cassel\\n,\\nTheo Wull\\n, and Ser \\nMark Ryswell\\n. They were seven facing three, but these three were men of the \\nKingsguard\\n and\\nliving legends: \\nLord Commander\\n Ser \\nGerold Hightower\\n, Ser \\nArthur Dayne\\n the \\nSword of the Morning\\n, and Ser\\nOswell Whent\\n. Ned had looked for them on the \\nTrident\\n, and at the \\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n, and at the \\nSiege of\\nStorm\\'s End\\n, but found them guarding this tower near the \\nRed Mountains\\n of \\nDorne\\n. In spite of Rhaegar’s death, they\\nrefused to bend the knee. By the end, only Ned and Howland Reed remain alive. Ned is awoken from the dream in\\nthe midst of making a promise to his dying sister \\nLyanna\\n after the battle.\\nVayon Poole\\n is calling and this wakes Ned. He is informed that it has been six days and King \\nRobert\\n has\\ncommanded that Ned attend him when he wakes. Ned replies that he is too weak, but that he would be pleased to\\nreceive the king in his room. When Ned asks for his captain of the guard (remembering that \\nJory\\n is dead), \\nAlyn\\nappears. He tells Ned that \\nJaime Lannister\\n has left \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, that extra guards have been put on, that his\\ndaughters have been with him every day, and that Jory, \\nHeward\\n, and \\nWyl\\n have been given to the \\nsilent sisters\\n to be\\nsent north to \\nWinterfell\\n. Ned remembers that Jory’s father, Martyn Cassel—who was one of his seven at the Tower\\nof Joy—was buried in the \\nDornish Marches\\n with the others. That takes Ned back to his dream. He does not think it\\nbodes well for him to dream that dream now. It is then that Poole announces the arrival of both Robert and \\nCersei\\n.\\nNed does not think it bodes well that Cersei has come, either. Ned orders that they be sent in, and that the others\\nleave, as what is to be said should be kept secret.\\nWhen Robert asks if Ned knows what his wife has done, Ned states that \\nCatelyn\\n is blameless since she took action\\non his behalf and under his authority as \\nHand of the King\\n. The king tells Ned he is unhappy: the King’s Hand is\\nsupposed to keep the peace, but seven men are dead. Cersei corrects this to eight, as a Lannister \\nguardsman\\n recently\\ndied of his wounds. Robert declares that he will not tolerate it and demands that Ned command \\nTyrion Lannister\\n’s\\nrelease and make peace with Jaime. Ned angrily replies that three of his men were butchered in front of his eyes\\nbecause Jaime wished to chastise him.\\nCersei leaps to Jaime’s defense, accusing Ned and his men of attacking Jaime while returning drunk from a brothel.\\nNed calmly reminds Robert that he should know him better than that, and that \\nLittlefinger\\n will confirm his story.\\nRobert replies that Littlefinger only said they had been returning from a brothel. Ned angrily informs Robert that he\\nwas at the brothel to visit Robert’s \\nbastard daughter\\n. When Robert criticizes the girl’s choice of name Ned has a hard\\ntime keeping his temper as he demands to know how one could expect a 15-year-old whore to have better sense. He\\nthen tells Robert that the girl is in love with him.\\nNed asks for Robert’s leave to bring Jaime back to face justice. Robert tells him to leave it alone and make peace\\nwith Jaime. Ned declares that if that is Robert’s notion of justice he is pleased he is no longer his Hand. Cersei\\n\\ndeclares, \"If any man had dared speak to a \\nTargaryen\\n as he had spoken to you—\" but Robert cuts her off by asking\\nangrily if she mistook him for \\nAerys\\n. Cersei presses on regardless, telling Robert that she took him for a king, that\\nJaime and Tyrion are his brothers by marriage, and that Ned dishonors them all by driving off one brother and\\nabducting the other. She steps too far, however, when she declares that Robert should be the one in skirts and her in\\narmor. Robert’s face goes purple with rage and he lashes out with a blow to Cersei’s face that knocks her to the\\nfloor. Cersei remarks that she will wear the bruise as a badge of honor before she is escorted out by Ser \\nMeryn\\nTrant\\n.\\nRobert, in misery, asks Ned if he sees what Cersei does to him. He continues that he should not have hit her, but\\nsays he does not know how to fight someone you cannot hit. Robert then declares that \\nRhaegar\\n won: Rhaegar has\\nLyanna and he has Cersei. Ned tells Robert that they need to talk, but Robert is sick of talk and intends to hunt on\\nthe morrow; whatever Ned wants to tell him can wait until he returns. When Ned reminds Robert that by then he\\nwill have departed for \\nWinterfell\\n as commanded, Robert throws the \\nHand\\n’s badge of office onto the bed and forbids\\nNed to leave. Ned asks about \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n and is told that is done. Ned continues by asking why Robert\\nwants him as Hand if he will not listen to his advice. Robert states that somebody has to run the kingdom. As he\\nleaves, Robert swears that if Ned resigns again, he will pin the badge on Jaime Lannister.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard IX\\n↑\\nTyrion V\\n ←\\nEddard X\\n→ \\nCatelyn VII\\n↓\\nEddard XI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 40: Catelyn VII\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nEyrie\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn VI\\n↑\\nEddard X\\n ←\\nCatelyn VII\\n→ \\nJon V\\n↓\\nCatelyn VIII\\nCatelyn\\n gets news from \\nRiverrun\\n that \\nHouse Lannister\\n is gathering an army at \\nCasterly Rock\\n.

In the duel, \\nBronn\\n kills Ser \\nVardis Egen\\n and Lysa sets Bronn and Tyrion free outside the\\nBloody Gate\\n to take their chances with the \\nVale mountain clans\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nCatelyn\\n watches dawn break over the \\nEyrie\\n. Below is the waterfall called \\nAlyssa\\'s Tears\\n, named after \\na woman\\n who\\nhad seen her husband, brothers, and all her children slain but never shed a tear. Catelyn wonders how large a\\nwaterfall her own tears will make when she dies.\\nShe asks and Ser \\nRodrik\\n continues with his news. Ser \\nJaime Lannister\\n is gathering an army at \\nCasterly Rock\\n.\\nCatelyn’s brother \\nEdmure\\n writes that he has commanded Lords \\nVance\\n and \\nPiper\\n to guard the pass below the \\nGolden\\nTooth\\n. Edmure’s letter goes on to declare that he will yield no foot of \\nTully\\n land without soaking it in \\nLannister\\nblood. Catelyn is in a foul mood and asks why the letter makes no mention of \\ntheir father\\n, the lord of \\nRiverrun\\n, who\\nmust be very sick to give the defense over to Edmure.\\nWhen Catelyn says that she should have been woken immediately when the letter arrived, Ser Rodrik explains that\\nLysa\\n thought it was better to let her sleep. He also mentions that her sister plans to speak with her after the combat.\\nCatelyn declares the combat a \\nmummer\\n’s farce, angry that Lysa cannot see \\nTyrion Lannister\\n has tricked her. In\\nCatelyn’s opinion it is past time that she and Ser Rodrik leave for \\nWinterfell\\n, planning to take a ship north from\\nGulltown\\n. Ser Rodrik pales at the thought of another sea voyage.\\nAs the servants dress her, Catelyn hopes that she can talk to her sister before the duel. The shy girl Catelyn knew at\\nRiverrun has grown into a vain and inconstant woman. When the message came that Tyrion wanted to confess,\\nCatelyn had tried to convince Lysa to talk to the dwarf in private, but her sister insisted on a public show.\\nAs they come to the doors of Lysa’s apartment, Ser \\nBrynden\\n the Blackfish is coming out. He is angry that Lysa has\\nrefused to grant him a thousand men to aid the defense of the \\nriverlands\\n. He declares that he has resigned as Knight\\nof the \\nBloody Gate\\n and will go alone. Concerned about her uncle travelling the \\nhigh road\\n alone, Catelyn suggests he\\nreturn to Winterfell with them and receive his thousand men from her. Ser Brynden agrees and Catelyn and Ser\\nRodrik enter Lysa’s apartment.\\nLysa’s apartments overlook a grassy area scattered with statues (the remnants of a failed attempt to plant a\\ngodswood\\n) where the duel will take place. An elegant looking Lysa is holding court on the terrace, surrounded by\\nher many suitors. The young Lord \\nRobert\\n is in a chair on an elevated platform being entertained by a puppeteer.\\nCatelyn attempts to explain to Lysa that they have nothing to gain by executing \\nTyrion Lannister\\n and everything to\\nlose if his champion should succeed. Lysa and her suitors insist that any knight is superior to a common \\nsellsword\\nlike Bronn. Having seen \\nBronn\\n fight on the high road, Catelyn is much less certain. Trying another approach,\\nCatelyn argues that the Lannisters (especially \\nJaime Lannister\\n) will not be satisfied that they had a trial before\\nexecuting Tyrion. \\nLyn Corbray\\n insists that Tyrion’s head will serve as a warning to the Lannisters, but Lysa insists\\n\\nthat her son wants to see Tyrion fly as if it settles the matter. Catelyn attempts one final time to stop the trial by\\nclaiming Tyrion is \\nher\\n prisoner. Lysa merely rants that Tyrion killed her husband and she means to see him pay.\\nSer Rodrik asks Catelyn quietly if she truly thinks Tyrion did it. She states that she believes the Lannisters murdered\\nJon Arryn\\n, but she cannot say whether it was \\nCersei\\n, Jaime, or Tyrion; Lysa named Cersei in her letter, but now she\\nseems certain it was Tyrion, perhaps because she has Tyrion as her captive. Ser Rodrik agrees that poison could be\\nthe work of Tyrion or Cersei, but Jaime is too fond of blood to have used poison. Catelyn wonders how else they\\ncould have made it look a natural death.\\nWhen Catelyn hears her nephew shriek in delight at the antics of the puppets, she states that the boy is too\\nundisciplined; he will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from Lysa. \\nMaester\\n \\nColemon\\n, having\\noverheard this, pipes in that Jon Arryn agreed and was planning to send the boy to \\nDragonstone\\n. Catelyn corrects\\nhim that it was \\nCasterly Rock\\n, but the maester insists it was Dragonstone.\\nTyrion Lannister is led forward and Robert asks if he can make him fly. Then the two champions appear from either\\nside of the garden. Ser \\nVardis Egen\\n is armored in plate from head to toe with a narrow slit for vision. Bronn looks\\nalmost naked by comparison, wearing only a half helm, a mail coif, and ringmail over boiled leather. However,\\nCatelyn notices that Bronn is 15 years younger and half a hand taller, with a greater reach than Ser Vardis,\\nThe \\nsepton\\n calls upon the gods before making a hasty departure. Robert is impatient for the fight to start. The\\nknight’s heavy kite shield is strapped to his arm by a squire. When offered a shield, Bronn refuses. The knight is\\nhanded an elegant double-edged sword that Lysa announces belonged to Jon Arryn for ceremonial occasions. Lysa\\nexplains that she thinks it is only fitting that Ser Vardis avenge Lord Arryn with his own blade, but Catelyn notices\\nthat Ser Vardis shows some discomfort with the strange sword. Finally, Robert is allowed to initiate the fight. After\\nan initial probing exchange, Bronn starts to leap away from the knight’s advances. The crowd starts declaring that\\nBronn is craven, but Ser Rodrik tells Catelyn that Bronn is trying to tire the knight.\\nAs she watches the fight, Catelyn remembers the duel between \\nBrandon Stark\\n and \\nPetyr Baelish\\n. When Brandon\\nsaw the limited armor Petyr was wearing, he took off most of his own armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor, but\\nher father had promised her to Brandon. As she had given the favor to Brandon, Catelyn had begged him to not kill\\nPetyr and he had agreed. The fight was ended quickly with a deep cut to Petyr’s ribs, which Catelyn was sure was\\nfatal. That was the last time she had seen Petyr \\nuntil King’s Landing\\n.\\nWhen Catelyn returns her attention to the fight she can tell Bronn is quicker. Robert complains that the combatants\\nare not fighting properly, but his mother assures him that the \\nsellsword\\n cannot run all day. Eventually Ser Vardis is\\naddled by a fall, and loses sight of Bronn because of his narrow visor. Bronn uses this opportunity to place a serious\\nblow to the knight’s elbow. Now the knight’s parries begin to grow slower and lower and Bronn attacks with more\\nenergy. Blind to the fact that Ser Vardis is losing, Lysa calls for him to finish the sellsword as if he were delaying\\nthe end on purpose. The knight charges and Bronn almost loses his balance but manages to jump back from the blow\\nand push a statue onto the knight. With Ser Vardis pinned under the fallen statue, Bronn delivers the killing blow\\nand a silence falls over the crowd.\\nRobert asks if it is over, and Lysa is forced to admit it is. Robert then asks if he can make the little man fly and\\nTyrion joyfully says, “Not this little man.” When Lysa makes a thinly veiled threat to execute Tyrion anyway, the\\ndwarf asks if Lysa remembers \\nHouse Arryn\\n’s words: “As High as Honor.” Robert insists that he wants to make\\nTyrion fly, but Lysa is forced to admit that the gods have proclaimed Tyrion innocent. She orders Tyrion and Bronn\\nescorted to the \\nBloody Gate\\n and provided with supplies, but they must take the high road alone. Everyone in the\\ncourt recognizes the proclamation as another sort of death sentence. Tyrion favors Lysa with a mocking bow, saying\\nhe and Bronn already know the way.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn VI\\n↑\\nEddard X\\n ←\\nCatelyn VII\\n→ \\nJon V\\n↓\\nCatelyn VIII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 41: Jon V\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon IV\\n↑\\nCatelyn VII\\n ←\\nJon V\\n→ \\nTyrion VI\\n↓\\nJon VI\\nSer \\nAlliser\\n announces that he is passing eight recruits, including \\nJon\\n.

As the boys pass a celebratory wineskin\\naround, Jon notices \\nSam\\n standing by himself and goes over to him. Sam proclaims that Jon will be first ranger\\nsomeday, like \\nhis uncle\\n “was.” Jon corrects this to “is.” Halder interrupts to ask if Jon is going to drink the wine he\\nis carrying. Then Pyp grabs the wineskin, and squirts it into Jon’s face. Soon the ecstatic boys start a snowball fight\\nand by the time Jon can break free, Sam has disappeared.\\nThe promoted boys are treated to a marvelous feast that night to celebrate. The group discusses and jokes about their\\nassignments: ranger, builder, woodsman, steward. They are all convinced that Jon, as the best swordsman and rider,\\nwill be a ranger, like his uncle “was” the First Ranger. Jon corrects this to “is” once again before pushing his food\\naway and leaving. Pyp follows and asks what is wrong. Jon explains that it is because Sam is not with them. Without\\nthem to protect him, Sam will be at the mercy of Ser Alliser. Pyp assures Jon that they did all they could for Sam,\\nbut that is not good enough for Jon. Jon goes for a long ride by himself.\\nAs he rides he thinks about the world outside the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n and reminds himself that he has not yet sworn his\\nvow. He thinks of all the places he has wanted to travel to and will never visit. He longs to go back to \\nWinterfell\\n to\\nbe with his half-brothers, but then remembers that Lady \\nCatelyn\\n will not welcome him. Jon decides that there is no\\nplace for him in Winterfell or \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, and remembers that not even his mother had a place for him.\\nWhoever she was, his mother must be something dishonorable, otherwise why would Lord \\nEddard\\n be too ashamed\\nto speak of her? On the ride back Jon thinks about what he should do about Sam.\\nJon visits \\nMaester\\n \\nAemon\\n despite the late hour. Aemon’s stewards, \\nChett\\n and \\nClydas\\n, considered the ugliest men in\\nthe Watch, meet him at the door. Chett insists that the maester is asleep and orders Jon to come back in the morning.\\nJon puts his foot in the door to prevent it closing, and refuses to leave since tomorrow will be too late. Chett goes to\\nget the maester, while Jon goes to the library and starts a fire as instructed.\\nWhen Maester Aemon arrives, he sits by the fire and assures Jon that a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion from\\nthe sleeplessness of old age. Jon asks that Sam be accepted as a sworn brother along with the others. Chett\\ncomplains that it is no concern of the maester and Maester Aemon agrees that training is the responsibility of Ser\\nAlliser. Jon continues on to explain about all he and the others have done to protect Sam.\\nChett remains adamant that Ser Alliser will make a man of Sam or kill him trying. Jon replies that the Watch has\\n\\nneed of every man and thus to kill one in futile training would be stupid. Recalling Maester \\nLuwin\\n’s words about\\nwhy a maester’s chain is made of many kinds of metal, Jon declares that the Watch (like a kingdom) needs all sorts\\nof skills and knowledge. Then Jon asks why Sam could not be a steward. As a steward, Chett objects that it is not\\neasy work fit for cowards: they keep the Watch alive by hunting, farming, gather firewood, make clothing, and bring\\nup supplies. Maester Aemon calmly names a number of steward duties and Jon has to admit that none of them suit\\nSam. Then Jon declares that there is one thing Sam can do better than anyone else: help Maester Aemon, since he\\ncan do sums, read, write, and is good with animals like the ravens. The maester considers this for a while and then\\ntells Jon that he will think on it.\\nNavigation:\\nJon IV\\n↑\\nCatelyn VII\\n ←\\nJon V\\n→ \\nTyrion VI\\n↓\\nJon VI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 42: Tyrion VI\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nhigh road\\n through the \\nMountains of the Moon\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion V\\n↑\\nJon V\\n ←\\nTyrion VI\\n→ \\nEddard XI\\n↓\\nTyrion VII\\nTyrion\\n and \\nBronn\\n make camp on the \\nhigh road\\n.

As Tyrion\\nplans, the \\nStone Crows\\n arrive and Tyrion negotiates an agreement.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n and \\nBronn\\n have taken shelter beneath some aspens just off the \\nhigh road\\n. Tyrion is gathering wood and asks\\nBronn if a particular branch will do for a fire. Bronn asks if he has a death wish, as a fire will bring the \\nVale\\nmountain clans\\n down on them. Bronn thinks it is best to travel fast at night, avoid the road, and make no noise or\\nfires. Tyrion states that traveling fast at night is a good way to fall down the mountain and that the clans will find\\nthem no matter what they do. Bronn replies that that means they are dead men. Tyrion insists that he would prefer to\\ndie comfortable and asks if Bronn can find some game; he does not look forward to the salt beef and hard bread that\\nLysa Arryn\\n had provided them.\\nBronn threatens to take Tyrion’s horse and leave, asking what Tyrion would do. Tyrion replies that he would\\nprobably die. When Bronn asks if Tyrion believes his threat, Tyrion admits he does, commenting that Bronn was\\nquick to finish off \\nChiggen\\n when he took an arrow in the belly. Bronn points out that Chiggen was as good as dead\\nanyway and would have done the same for him.\\nBronn explains that although he fought for Tyrion he is not his friend and not his servant. Tyrion accepts this with\\ngood humor, stating that he is mainly interested in Bronn’s sword, not his friendship. When Bronn asks how Tyrion\\nknew he would be his champion, Tyrion explains that he did not know, but anticipated Bronn’s \\nsellsword\\n nature: go\\nfor the gold. Bronn helped take Tyrion captive in hopes of a reward, but the \\nStarks\\n are too proud to take lowborn\\nscum like Bronn into their service permanently, so Tyrion had gambled that Bronn would abandon Lady \\nCatelyn\\n for\\nthe next hopeful venture: rescuing him.\\nBronn tells Tyrion that he has a bold tongue and that someday somebody will cut it out and make him eat it. Tyrion\\nreplies that everyone tells him that. Tyrion then declares that although Bronn is scum, he is not stupid and knows\\nwhere his best interest lie, luckily for Tyrion. When Bronn quickly lights the fire with flint, Tyrion compliments that\\nBronn is also useful and almost as good with a sword as his brother \\nJaime\\n.\\nThen Tyrion asks what Bronn wants: gold, land, or women. He promises that if Bronn keeps him alive he will have\\nit. Bronn asks about what happens if Tyrion dies. Tyrion quips that then he will have one sincere mourner. Bronn\\nthen informs Tyrion that his is no man’s toady. Tyrion replies that he is sure Bronn is no man’s friend, adding that\\nhe is sure Bronn will betray him just like Lady Stark if there is a profit. However, Tyrion begs Bronn to remember\\nthat he will match any price offered to betray him because he likes living. Bronn disappears to go hunting at\\nTyrion’s request.\\nAn hour later they are eating a goat they have roasted. Tyrion complains about the meat’s toughness, but says he\\nwill not complain too loudly since at the \\nEyrie\\n he would have to dance on a precipice for a boiled bean. Bronn then\\ncomplains that Tyrion gave the \\nturnkey\\n a purse of gold and Tyrion states that a Lannister always pays his debts. He\\nkept his silver, however. After giving the turnkey the purse, Tyrion told him that if he ever tired of Lady Arryn’s\\n\\nservice, he need only come to \\nCasterly Rock\\n to get the rest. Bronn asks what Tyrion plans when they reach the river\\nand Tyrion states a whore, a feather bed, and wine for a start and then on to Casterly Rock or King’s Landing since\\nhe has questions about a dagger. Bronn seems surprised that Tyrion is truly innocent.\\nAs they settle down for the night, Tyrion notes that the clansmen are taking their time. Bronn replies that he would\\nfear a trap with them being so open. Tyrion suggests they sing to scare them away. As Tyrion whistles a song, he\\nasks Bronn if he has ever heard it before. Bronn states he has heard it in inns and whorehouses. Tyrion goes on to\\nsay the \\nfirst girl\\n he bedded used to sing it. He tells Bronn the story of when he and his brother \\nJaime\\n rescued her.\\nThey heard a scream and Tysha came running onto the road chased by two men. Jaime went after the men while\\nTyrion dismounted to protect the girl. He tells Bronn that she was about a year older than him, low born, half-\\nstarved, and unwashed. When Jaime left to get help from \\nCasterly Rock\\n, Tyrion took her to an inn where they shared\\na meal and talked. The wine went to 13-year old Tyrion’s head and he found himself in bed with her. When he broke\\nher maidenhead she wept and then kissed him. He found a drunken \\nsepton\\n to marry them and set her up a cottage of\\nher own where they played man and wife for a fortnight. Then the septon sobered and told \\nTyrion’s father\\n, and that\\nwas the end of his marriage. Jaime was forced to confess that the girl was a whore and that he set the whole thing\\nup. Then Lord Tywin gave her to a barracks of guardsmen and paid her a silver for each one. Tywin made Tyrion go\\nlast, having him pay her a gold coin since he was a Lannister.\\nBronn states that he would have killed the man who did that to him and Tyrion states that he might yet; a Lannister\\nalways pays his debts. Tyrion rolls into his \\nshadowskin\\n cloak to sleep, and dreams of the \\nsky cells\\n but this time he is\\nthe jailor, driving his father back to the abyss.\\nBronn wakes him with a warning and Tyrion motions for Bronn to stay still. Then Tyrion calls out for the clansmen\\nto join them and share their goat. A voice replies that, since this is their mountain, it is their goat. Tyrion agrees that\\nit is and asks their names. They declare themselves \\nStone Crows\\n and a big man named \\nShagga\\n armed with two axes\\nsteps into the light first. Slowly the rest emerge, armed with a variety of weapons including pitchforks.\\nTyrion introduces himself and declares himself a member of “Clan Lannister.” He offers to pay the clansmen for the\\ngoat they ate. \\nGunthor son of Gurn\\n, who seems to be their chief, asks what he has to give them, and Tyrion tells\\nthem he has silver in his purse, and his weapons and armor. \\nConn\\n replies that Tyrion is going to pay them with their\\nown coin; they can take what they want from their corpses. Gunthor states they have nothing to give but their lives\\nand asks Tyrion how he would like to die. Tyrion replies, “In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden’s\\nmouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.” Shagga laughs but the others seem unamused.\\nGunthor tells Conn to kill Bronn and take Tyrion to milk goats and make the mothers laugh. Bronn springs to his\\nfeet, asking who dies first, but Tyrion screams for him to stop. Tyrion asks the clansmen if their weapons are the\\nbest they could steal, declaring them good for killing sheep at most. He adds that his father’s smiths shit better\\nweapons. Gunthor, thinking of the starving women and children of his tribe, is interested and asks what Tyrion will\\ngive them for their lives. In addition to the list of weapons suggested by the tribesmen, Tyrion offers them the \\nVale\\nof Arryn\\n.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion V\\n↑\\nJon V\\n ←\\nTyrion VI\\n→ \\nEddard XI\\n↓\\nTyrion VII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 43: Eddard XI\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard X\\n↑\\nTyrion VI\\n ←\\nEddard XI\\n→ \\nSansa III\\n↓\\nEddard XII\\nAs \\nHand of the King\\n, \\nNed\\n hears a petition from some \\nHouse Tully\\n bannermen concerning raiding on their holdfasts\\nby \\nGregor Clegane\\n. He strips Clegane of all lands, titles, and his life and sends a force under Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\nto dispense the king\\'s justice.\\nSynopsis\\nEddard Stark\\n is in the throne room where \\nRobert I Baratheon\\n\\'s hunting tapestries have replaced the \\nskulls of the\\nTargaryen dragons\\n. He is extremely uncomfortable after hours on the \\nIron Throne\\n; the throne\\'s spikes and jagged\\nmetal make it impossible to lean back and his shattered leg is throbbing more sharply each minute. \\nAegon the\\nConqueror\\n, who commanded his armorers to create the throne out of the swords laid down by his enemies, had said\\na king should never sit easy. At this point, Ned is damning both Robert and Aegon. His only conciliation is that at\\nleast he can sit, as can the three councilors in attendance: \\nVarys\\n, \\nPetyr Baelish\\n, and Grand Maester \\nPycelle\\n. The rest\\n—including the petitioners, lords, and guards—must stand.\\nThe kingdom has been a tinderbox since \\nCatelyn Stark\\n seized \\nTyrion Lannister\\n, and Ned has the task of figuring out\\nhow best to stanch the hemorrhaging. Ser \\nKaryl Vance\\n explains that the smallfolk kneeling before him are all that\\nremains of the holdfast of \\nSherrer\\n, while those of \\nWendish Town\\n and the \\nMummer\\'s Ford\\n are all dead. The villagers\\ntell of the brutality, murder, rape, and destruction. The \\nraiders\\n were interested not in stealing but in destruction,\\nmaking them \\nLannister\\n invaders. Ser \\nRaymun Darry\\n continues by explaining that the people of Wendish Town took\\nrefuge in their wooden holdfast but the perpetrators burned the holdfast and shot anyone that tried to run out. The\\nSherrer holdfast was made of stone, so this tactic did not work.\\nNed asks for proof that the raiders were from House Lannister and is told that there were 50 or 100 men, all mounted\\non war horses and armored in mail with good weapons. Their armor was plain and they flew no banners but the\\nleader was as big as an ox: \\nGregor Clegane\\n, the Mountain That Rides. Pycelle points out that there are many large\\nmen in the kingdom, but the petitioning knights insist there is none as large as the Mountain. Pycelle asks why the\\nMountain, who holds lands and is an anointed knight, would turn brigand. Ser \\nMarq Piper\\n calls the Mountain a false\\nknight and Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n\\'s mad dog. Pycelle asks Ned to remind the knight that Lord Tywin is the father of\\ntheir gracious queen, \\nCersei Lannister\\n. Ned sarcastically declares that the court might have forgotten if Pycelle had\\nnot reminded them. It is then that Ned looks up to see men going out the door and also spots Septa \\nMordane\\n with\\nSansa Stark\\n; he has a flash of anger since this is no place for a girl, but calms himself that the septa had no way of\\nknowing this was no ordinary day.\\nLittlefinger asks where the knights responsible for protecting these holdfasts were when this destruction was going\\non. The petitioning knights reply that they had answered the call of their liege lord to marshal at \\nRiverrun\\n and below\\nthe \\nGolden Tooth\\n in anticipation of a Lannister invasion. They also declare that now Ser \\nEdmure Tully\\n has dispersed\\nmen to guard all the border holdfasts along the \\nRed Fork\\n. Ned thinks to himself that this may be exactly what Lord\\nTywin wants: to bleed off the strength of Riverrun as Edmure scatters his swords to defend every holdfast.\\nLittlefinger asks what the knights are looking for from the throne if they have already protected their lands. They\\nreply that, as they still keep the king\\'s peace, they seek permission to retaliate. Ned is thankful that they have asked;\\nTywin Lannister obviously hoped to provoke a Tully invasion so that he might claim to be the aggrieved party.\\n\\nPycelle insists that it is Lord Tywin\\'s responsibility to dispense justice to his bannerman, Ser Gregor, but Ned\\nreminds everyone that all justice flows from the king.\\nPycelle immediately suggests that, in that case, they should wait for Robert to return, but Ned asserts his right as\\nHand\\n to speak for the king. He spies Ser \\nRobar Royce\\n, whose father is hunting with Robert, and tells him to ride to\\nthe king and advise him of the situation. Ned refuses the petitioning knights permission for vengeance and tells the\\nvillagers he cannot give them back what they have lost, but can give them justice. He continues by telling the\\nvillagers that the \\nFirst Men\\n believed that the man who passes judgment should wield the sword, but his injury means\\nhe must send another to do his killing. Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n asks for the honor of slaying Ser Gregor, but Ned denies\\nhim, reiterating that the goal is justice, not vengeance. Ned looks at the assembled lords and orders Lord \\nBeric\\nDondarrion\\n, \\nThoros of Myr\\n, Ser \\nGladden Wylde\\n, and Lord \\nLothar Mallery\\n to each assemble twenty men. Ned also\\nsends twenty \\nHouse Stark guards\\n of \\nWinterfell\\n. Lord Beric is given command, as befits his rank. Then Ned\\nannounces in the name of Robert that these men are charged with bringing to justice the false knight Gregor\\nClegane, and that Gregor is stripped of all lands and titles and sentenced to death. Then he tells them to ride at first\\nlight so it can be done quickly, and that the throne will hear no more petitions.\\nAt the base of the throne, \\nVarys\\n is still gathering papers when everyone else has left. He declares Ned a bolder man\\nthan himself. He goes on to suggest that Ned should have sent Ser Loras, as a man who is an enemy of the\\nLannisters would do well to make the \\nTyrells\\n his friends. Varys also reminds Ned that it was a slight not to send Ser\\nIlyn Payne\\n since he is the \\nKing\\'s Justice\\n. Ned does not like the man, but tells Varys that he would prefer not to send\\na Lannister man to kill a Lannister bannerman. Varys informs Ned that he saw Ilyn in the back and he did not look\\npleased, likely because he so loves his work.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard X\\n↑\\nTyrion VI\\n ←\\nEddard XI\\n→ \\nSansa III\\n↓\\nEddard XII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 44: Sansa III\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa II\\n↑\\nEddard XI\\n ←\\nSansa III\\n→ \\nEddard XII\\n↓\\nSansa IV\\nSansa\\n wonders with \\nJeyne Poole\\n why \\nher father\\n did not send the gallant Ser \\nLoras\\n to kill the monster Ser \\nGregor\\n.\\nThe next day her father reveals that he is sending her and \\nArya\\n back to \\nWinterfell\\n. Sansa insists that she cannot\\nleave because she is to marry Prince \\nJoffrey\\n, who is nothing like \\nhis father\\n and will give her children with golden\\nhair. This is an epiphany to her father.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa is bewildered that \\nher father\\n did not send the \\nKnight of Flowers\\n after Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n. She tells her friend\\nJeyne Poole\\n that she thinks it is because her father was in a foul mood from his leg wound. Sansa believes sending\\nSer Loras, who looks like a hero, to slay the monstrous Ser Gregor would have been just like the tales. Sansa tells\\nJeyne that she said as much to Septa \\nMordane\\n, but that the septa only told her not to question her father’s decisions.\\nLittlefinger\\n, who had overheard, claimed that her father’s decisions could do with a bit of questioning. When Sansa\\nhad explained to him about monsters and heroes, Littlefinger told her life was not a song.\\nJeyne suggests that Lord Eddard should have sent Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n, but Sansa replies that he is like a second monster.\\nThen Jeyne begins to speak dreamily about Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n, telling Sansa how brave and gallant he is. Sansa\\ncan only think that even though Lord Beric is handsome, he is also old: almost 22.\\nChanging the subject, Sansa tells Jeyne that she has had a dream about Prince \\nJoffrey\\n taking the white hart the\\nking’s party is hunting in the \\nKingswood\\n; it was actually only a wish, but Sansa thinks it sounds better to call it a\\ndream. In her heart, Sansa thinks that her prince is far worthier than his drunken father. Jeyne asks if Joffrey just\\ntouched the hart in the dream, since that is what heroes always do in the stories, but Sansa insists that Joffrey shot it\\nwith a golden arrow and brought it back for her because she knows Joffrey likes hunting and killing.\\nSansa does not think Joffrey had anything to do with killing her father’s men; that was all his uncle \\nJaime\\nLannister\\n’s doing. She knows her father is still angry about it, but believes that blaming Joffrey would be like\\nblaming her for something \\nArya\\n did. The mention of Arya leads Jeyne to speak of how she saw Arya walking on her\\nhands. Both agree that they cannot understand why Arya does anything.\\nNext Sansa tells Jeyne about \\nYoren\\n coming before the throne to ask for more men to man \\nthe Wall\\n. After seeing the\\ndirty, smelly \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n recruiter (nothing like her \\nUncle Benjen\\n), Sansa felt sorry for her bastard brother \\nJon\\nSnow\\n. No one would volunteer for the Watch, so her father gave Yoren his pick of the dungeons. Jeyne soon\\ninterrupts Sansa to suggest they go to the kitchen to get some lemon cakes and Sansa agrees.\\nThe next morning Sansa wakes to watch Lord Beric depart with his men and thinks it is a song come to life.\\nAfterward, the \\nTower of the Hand\\n is so empty Sansa is even happy to see Arya. Arya asks if the men have gone to\\nhunt down Jaime Lannister, and Sansa explains that they have gone for Ser Gregor Clegane. Sansa then asks Septa\\nMordane whether they will put the Mountain’s head on a spike over his own gate or bring it back to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n.\\nThe septa is horrified that Sansa would discuss such a thing over breakfast.\\nArya wonders why men were not sent after Jaime Lannister, since he killed \\nJory Cassel\\n and the others, or after \\nthe\\nHound\\n for killing her friend \\nMycah\\n. Sansa declares that it is not the same thing because Mycah attacked Joffrey.\\n\\nArya erupts, shouting that Sansa is a liar. Sansa responds snobbishly that Arya can say whatever she wants but will\\nstill have to bow and call her “Your Grace” after she marries Joffrey. Arya throws an orange at Sansa, staining her\\nbeautiful ivory dress and driving Sansa to declare that it should have been Arya they killed, not \\nLady\\n. The septa\\norders both of them to their rooms, where Sansa tears off her stained clothes and goes to sleep.\\nSansa is dreaming of Lady when Septa Mordane wakes her and brings her to her father. Once Arya is brought, Sansa\\nimmediately claims that Arya started the fight and ruined her dress. Eddard silences Sansa and Arya takes the\\nopportunity to apologize and ask for Sansa’s forgiveness. Sansa is dumbfounded but eventually asks about her dress.\\nArya offers to wash it, or failing that to sew her a new one.\\nEddard interrupts to tell them that he did not call them in to talk about dresses but to inform them that he is sending\\nthem back to \\nWinterfell\\n. Both sisters exclaim their unhappiness, and Eddard laughs that at last they can agree upon\\nsomething. Sansa insists that she has done nothing wrong and tells her father to send Arya away since she started it.\\nEddard explains that he is not sending them away as a punishment, but to keep them safe.\\nSansa insists that she cannot go; she is to marry Prince \\nJoffrey\\n, whom she loves as much as Queen \\nNaerys\\n loved\\nPrince \\nAemon\\n. She wants to be his queen and have his babies. Eddard assures Sansa that he will find her an\\nappropriate match and that Joffrey is no Prince Aemon. Sansa insists that she wants Joffrey and that she will give\\nhim a son with beautiful golden hair who will be the greatest king there ever was, as brave as a \\nwolf\\n and as proud as\\na \\nlion\\n. Arya points out that Joffrey is not a lion, but a \\nstag\\n like his father, and a craven and a liar besides. Sansa cries\\nout\\nHe is \\nnot!\\n He\\'s not the least bit like that old drunken king.\\nEddard gets a strange look on his face before telling them that they will sail as soon as he can find a ship. He also\\nwarns them not to tell anybody. Septa Mordane returns to urge Sansa to stop crying while Arya insists that a journey\\nby ship will be an adventure and that they will get to see everybody back at Winterfell again.

Later, Ned meets with Cersei and tells her that he will tell \\nRobert\\n the truth when he\\nreturns, offering her the chance to flee and save her children. Cersei warns that Ned has made a mistake.\\nSynopsis\\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n tells \\nEddard Stark\\n that the pain means that the bone is healing, but Ned only replies that he\\nwill be happy when his leg stops throbbing. Pycelle provides him with the \\nmilk of the poppy\\n for the pain, but Ned\\nsays he sleeps too much already. Pycelle tells him sleep is good for healing.\\nPycelle informs Ned that Queen \\nCersei\\n has received a letter from her father. Lord \\nTywin\\n is angry about Ned sending\\nmen to bring Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n to justice. Ned replies that it does not bother him; Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n rides\\nunder the king’s banner and if Lord Tywin attempts to interfere he will have \\nRobert\\n to answer to, and the only thing\\nRobert likes better than hunting is making war on defiant lords. Pycelle leaves, telling Ned that he will come again\\nthe next day.\\nNed knows Pycelle is Cersei’s creature, and doesn’t care. He is not actually confident in Robert, but he does not\\nwant Cersei to know that. He calls for honeyed wine, which will not cloud his mind as badly as the milk of the\\npoppy, because he needs to think. Ned thinks how sometimes a child’s innocent eyes can see things that grown men\\nare blind to and how some day he will have to tell \\nSansa\\n how she made it all come clear to him.\\nLittlefinger\\n pays a visit an hour after Pycelle leaves, bringing news that \\nVarys\\n has heard whispers that \\nsellswords\\n are\\nflocking to \\nCasterly Rock\\n. Ned asks about Robert and is told that, having found the white hart dead, the king is now\\nafter a fierce boar. Most of the hunting party has returned, however, including Prince \\nJoffrey\\n and \\nthe Hound\\n.\\nLittlefinger states that he would have liked to have seen the Hound’s reaction to learning that \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n is\\nafter the \\nbrother\\n he hates. With that Littlefinger leaves for a dinner, but not before noting the book of \\nThe Lineages\\nand Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms\\n, and teasingly asking if it is a sleeping potion.\\nNed considers that, outside of his retainers, there is not a man in the city he trusts: Littlefinger leaving before the\\nslaughter\\n of his guard rankles him, Varys knows too much and does too little, Pycelle is Cersei’s, and Ser \\nBarristan\\nis too old and rigid in his sense of duty.\\nArya\\n and Sansa will sail in three days. Ned knows that honor will require him to go to Robert with all he knows\\nwhen he returns. Last night he dreamed of when Lord Tywin had presented the bodies of Prince \\nRhaegar\\n’s children\\nto Robert. Ned remembers that Robert could be merciful if a man were brave and honest; he had pardoned Ser\\nBarristan, Varys, Pycelle, \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n, and Littlefinger and let them keep their office for an offer of fealty.\\nHowever poison in the dark he will never forgive and would kill them all. \\nBran\\n must have learned some part of the\\ntruth; otherwise they would not have tried to kill him. Ned decides that he must find a way to save the children.\\nNed calls in \\nFat Tom\\n, now in command of his guardsmen and asks to be taken to the \\ngodswood\\n. Ned also orders the\\nguard doubled despite the shortage of manpower. Ned sends Tom to find Queen Cersei and give her a letter inviting\\nher to join him. As he sits in the godswood, Ned feels the presence of his gods under the faceless \\nheart tree\\n and his\\n\\nleg does not seem to hurt as much.\\nWhen Cersei arrives at nightfall, Ned notes that she is proudly displaying the bruise Robert has given her. For the\\nfirst time in a long time, Ned can see her beauty. When he declares that he knows the truth \\nJon Arryn\\n died for,\\nCersei scoffs whether he has brought her here to pose riddles or to kidnap her. Ned replies that if she believed such\\nthings she would not have come. He then asks about the bruise, and if Robert does such things often. She replies that\\nit has never been on the face before and that her brother Jaime would have killed Robert if he knew.\\nWhen Ned suggests a correction of “brother” to “lover,” Cersei does not trouble to deny it. Cersei admits that she\\nand Jaime have been lovers since they were children and that when Jaime is in her she feels whole. When Ned asks\\nabout his son Bran, Cersei admits that he saw her and Jaime, offering her love for her own children as a reason for\\nthe attempted murder. Ned counters with a declaration that all three of Cersei’s children are Jaime’s. The last time a\\nBaratheon\\n had a child with a \\nLannister\\n was 90 years before when \\nTya Lannister\\n wedded \\nGowen Baratheon\\n; the\\nsingle child was large and lusty boy with a full head of black hair. Thirty years before that a Lannister had taken a\\nBaratheon maid; all the children had black hair. According to \\nThe Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the\\nSeven Kingdoms\\n, the children of a Lannister and a Baratheon always had black hair.\\nNed asks Cersei how it is possible that she never had a child by the king, and she admits she almost did but had the\\nchild aborted. Cersei goes on to claim that she cannot stand to even touch Robert now, and has not let him inside her\\nfor years. Instead she pleasures the king in other ways when he leaves his whores long enough; Robert is always so\\ndrunk that he never remembers.\\nWhen Ned asks what made her hate Robert so much, Cersei reveals that on their wedding night Robert called her\\n“\\nLyanna\\n” in the midst of the consummation. The story leads Ned to declare that he does not know which of them to\\npity more, but that he must still do his duty. Cersei makes a sexual advance on Ned while telling him that the realm\\nneeds a strong Hand and that he will never regret being kind to her. Ned immediately rejects the advance by asking\\nif she made the same offer to \\nJon Arryn\\n and she slaps him. Offended by Ned’s honorable persona, Cersei brings up\\nJon Snow\\n and accuses Ned of many other possible debaucheries.\\nNed makes it clear that he intends to tell Robert everything when he returns and warns Cersei to leave \\nKing\\'s\\nLanding\\n. He recommends that she take a ship to the \\nFree Cities\\n with all her immediate family, including \\nher father\\n,\\nto escape Robert’s wrath. Cersei stands, laughs, and declares Ned a fool for not taking the throne himself fourteen\\nyears before, when he forced Jaime to surrender the seat. Ned replies that he has made more mistakes than Cersei\\ncan imagine, but that was not one of them. Cersei insists that it was, saying \"When you play the game of thrones,\\nyou win or you die.

He draws his blade and demands what he\\nis owed. \\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n gives him a crown of molten gold.\\nSynopsis\\nThe \\nstallion’s heart\\n is still raw and steaming when it is placed before \\nDaenerys\\n. As part of the ancient \\nDothraki\\nmotherhood ritual she begins to eat the tough, stringy flesh. The Dothraki believe that the heart of the stallion will\\nmake her son strong and swift and fearless. If she chokes on the blood or retches the omens are less favorable: the\\nchild could be weak, deformed, stillborn, or female. In preparation, Daenerys has eaten bowls of blood and dried\\nhorse flesh and fasted for a day and a half, yet still her stomach roils and her jaw aches.\\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n stands over her as she eats, his face hard, but as she continues Daenerys begins to see pride in his eyes.\\nWhen she is done, Daenerys pronounces the words she has rehearsed to the \\ndosh khaleen\\n, the crones of \\nVaes\\nDothrak\\n. Even the most powerful \\nkhals\\n bow to the wisdom and authority of these crones, each of whom is the\\nkhaleesi\\n of a dead \\nkhal\\n.\\nThe crones proclaim, “The prince is riding; a boy, a boy, a strong boy,” and begin to chant. After the crowd finishes\\nchanting there is silence. Then one of the crones announces the greatness of the new prince, the \\nStallion Who\\nMounts the World\\n. Daenerys reveals the name of her son: \\nRhaego\\n, in honor of her \\nolder brother\\n.\\nKhal Drogo leads her out of the pit with his \\nbloodriders\\n behind, followed by the rest, down the godsway. As they\\nwalk, Drogo asks about the name of their son and Daenerys explains about her brother, a fierce warrior who died\\nbefore she was born; the last of the dragons. Drogo declares that it is a good name.\\nEventually they arrive at the lake called the \\nWomb of the World\\n. Here Daenerys strips out of her soiled clothing and\\nenters the lake. She cleanses her face and body of the dried blood. When she emerges from the lake, \\nDoreah\\n brings\\nher a robe of sandsilk, but Drogo waves her away. Daenerys can see his manhood through his trousers and helps him\\nunlace; with three quick strokes, he is done.\\nThey ride down the godsway to Drogo’s tent-hall where there is a great feast prepared for those too low of rank to\\nattend the ceremony. As Dany rides up the aisle, the crowd hails the life within her. When she dismounts, Daenerys\\ncannot find \\nViserys Targaryen\\n. She sees Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n in a place of respect in the midst of the hierarchy and\\ninvites him to her own table.\\nWhen Ser Jorah arrives she asks about Viserys. He explains that her brother went to the market to find wine.\\nDaenerys then questions why he was allowed to go alone since \\nthe Usurper\\n would pay well for his head. Ser Jorah\\nassures her that Viserys should be safe, as nobody can carry a blade or shed a man’s blood in \\nVaes Dothrak\\n.\\nDaenerys states that men still die; some of the merchants have huge eunuchs to strangle thieves bloodlessly. Ser\\nJorah declares that her brother should be wise enough not to steal anything. The knight goes on to explain that her\\nbrother was going to steal her dragon eggs until he threatened to cut off Viserys\\' hand. Daenerys declares that she\\nwould have given Viserys an egg if he had asked: she does owe him for their survival and he is all she has left of her\\n\\nfamily. Jorah tells her that she belongs to the Dothraki now.\\nDaenerys asks Ser Jorah about the Stallion Who Mounts the World. He explains that the Stallion is the \\nkhal\\n of \\nkhals\\n,\\nwho is prophesized to unite the Dothraki into a single \\nkhalasar\\n and lead them to conquer the world.\\nDoreah interrupts Daenerys to point out her brother entering the hall in rags, drunk, and carrying a sword. Angry\\nmutterings rise all around her and the music dies away. Daenerys has a sense of dread and asks Ser Jorah to stop him\\nand bring him to her. Viserys starts screaming for Daenerys and reproaching the indignity of starting the feast before\\nhis arrival. Ser Jorah is quickly by his side and tries to stop him, but Viserys jerks free. Then he moves to sit with\\nDrogo and the other \\nkhals\\n.\\nDrogo rises and declares through translation that Viserys’ place is not on the high bench but at the back where the\\nlowest of the low sit shrouded in shadow so that others do not have to look upon them. Viserys declares drunkenly\\nthat that is no place for a king, but Drogo emphasizes that it is his place, mocking him as the Sore-foot King and the\\nCart King. Viserys draws his blade, angering the Dothraki.Then he spots Daenerys and stalks over. She begs him to\\nthrow away the sword but Viserys ignores her. Viserys demands his crown or else he will take Daenerys back, but\\nhe will be happy to cut out her child and leave it for Drogo. To emphasis his point, Viserys presses his sword against\\nher belly hard enough to prick her navel through her silks.\\nJhiqui\\n is sobbing in fear, stating that she dare not translate Viserys’ words; if she does she fears Khal Drogo will\\ndrag her behind his horses up the \\nMother of Mountains\\n. Daenerys agrees to translate instead. After hearing the\\ntranslation, Drogo makes a statement in Dothraki and steps down from the high bench with his bloodriders. Viserys\\nasks and Daenerys translates: “You shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.” Viserys\\nsmiles and declares that that is all he ever wanted. His smile is what saddens Daenerys the most.\\nDrogo orders his bloodriders to seize the man who was her brother, breaking his arm and taking away his sword in\\nthe process. Drogo puts his belt of golden medallions into an emptied stew pot. Viserys finally realizes what is\\nhappening and begins to plead and struggle. Ser Jorah tells Daenerys to look away, but she refuses. When the gold is\\nhalf melted, Drogo declares “Crown for Cart King!” and upends the pot over Viserys’ head. Soon it is over; not a\\ndrop of blood is spilled.

The \\nKings of Winter\\n watch him with eyes of ice\\nand the \\ndirewolves\\n at their feet snarl. Finally, he comes to the tomb where \\nhis father\\n sleeps with \\nLyanna\\n and\\nBrandon\\n beside him. Lyanna\\'s statue whispers, “Promise me, Ned,” and her eyes weep blood.

When Ned reaches \\nMaegor\\'s Holdfast\\n,\\nhe finds the \\nKingsguard\\n guarding the bridge, the steps, and the royal apartments. Ned only has to look at Ser\\nBarristan Selmy\\n, who is waiting outside the king’s bedchamber, to know something is terribly wrong.\\nInside the bedchamber, he finds Robert in bed with \\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n, \\nRenly Baratheon\\n, and \\nCersei Lannister\\ngathered around him. The room smells of smoke, blood, and death. Tattered and blood-stained clothes litter the\\nfloor. Ned can see that his friend is dying. Renly explains that it was a boar, and Robert curses himself for drinking\\ntoo much wine and missing his thrust. When Ned asks where the rest of them were, Renly explains that Robert had\\ncalled everyone off to try to take the boar himself. Ned lifts the blanket and verifies that they have done what they\\ncan to close the rip from groin to nipple, but it is not nearly enough. The smell of death is horrible and\\noverpowering; Robert declares that even he can smell it, but still takes pride in having killed the boar, which he\\nwants served at his funeral feast.\\nRobert then orders everyone but Ned to leave. Pycelle tries to give Robert the \\nmilk of the poppy\\n before leaving, but\\nRobert refuses. Once they are gone, Ned damns Robert for being so headstrong.

Robert\\nthen expresses gratitude and admiration that Ned was the only one to tell him that he was wrong.\\nRobert tells Ned to write his final testament, in which he names Ned as \\nLord Regent\\n and Protector of the Realm\\nuntil his son comes of age. Ned cannot bring himself to tell Robert that \\nJoffrey\\n is not his son, so instead he\\nclandestinely changes the words to “my heir,” feeling soiled as he does so. Ned tells Robert that he cannot die\\nbecause the realm needs him, but Robert replies that the realm knows what a wretched king he was: as bad as \\nAerys\\n.\\nNed insists that Robert was not as bad as Aerys and Robert declares that at least this one thing he did right: he has\\ndeclared Ned as Regent and Ned will do it well. Robert signs the document and tells Ned that they are to serve the\\nboar at his funeral feast. He then asks that Ned rescind the death warrant on Daenerys and also to help his son be\\nbetter than he has been.

The king has Renly and Pycelle bear witness to his placing the seal on\\n\\nthe letter. Then the king asks for and drinks the milk of the poppy. As he fades off to sleep, he asks Ned if he will\\ndream and Ned assures him he will. Then Robert declares that he will give Ned’s love to \\nLyanna\\n. Last of all, Robert\\nrequests that Ned guard his children. Unable to tell the truth and unable to lie, all that Ned can think of is Robert’s\\nbastards when he tells him that he will.\\nPycelle tells Ned that he has done all that he can, but the wound has already mortified because it took two days to\\nget Robert back. When Ned asks how long, he is told that by rights the king should be dead already. Renly adds that\\nRobert was always strong, though perhaps not wise, recounting that Robert slew the boar even with his guts hanging\\nout. Ned replies admiringly that Robert was never one to leave the battle with an enemy standing.\\nSer Barristan is still standing outside and Ned tells him that the king is not to be disturbed. Ser Barristan laments that\\nhe has failed his sacred trust. Ned reassures the old knight that no one can defend a man against himself and even the\\nking blamed the wine. The knight admits that Robert was reeling drunk. \\nVarys\\n, who has just appeared, asks who\\ngave Robert all the wine, and Ser Barristan tells them it was the king’s elder squire, \\nLancel Lannister\\n. Varys states\\nthat he hopes the lad does not blame himself. Ned informs Varys that the king wants the assassination of Daenerys\\ncanceled. Varys tells him that those birds have flown but he will do what he can.\\nTomard\\n and \\nCayn\\n are helping Ned across the bridge when Renly catches up and asks for a private word. Renly asks\\nif Robert’s will makes him regent and, knowing his answer, tells Ned that he has 100 swords to offer him. Renly\\ndeclares that if they strike now, they can take the \\nRed Keep\\n and seize the royal children. Ned refuses, stating that\\nwhile Robert is still alive he will not shed blood in the castle. Renly insists that every moment Ned delays gives\\nCersei more time to prepare. Ned declares that they should pray for Robert’s recovery; sometimes the gods are\\nmerciful. Renly answers that the \\nLannisters\\n are not.\\nBy the time he returns to his \\ntower\\n, Ned is wondering if he should have accepted Renly’s offer; if the queen fights\\nhe will need every sword he can get. He has no taste for these intrigues. Ned first asks Cayn to bring \\nLittlefinger\\n to\\nhim and then commands Tomard to take 20 men to escort his daughters to the ship to take them to Winterfell. He\\nthen tells Tomard to stop at \\nDragonstone\\n on the way and deliver a letter for to Lord \\nStannis\\n, for his eyes only. After\\nTomard leaves, Ned sits in grief for his friend Robert and thinks how some will say that he had betrayed his king’s\\nfriendship and disinherited his sons. He hopes the gods will know better and that Robert will learn the truth in the\\nland beyond the grave. He then composes a letter to Stannis, telling him of Robert’s death and offering him the\\nthrone as the rightful heir. As he seals the letter, Ned reflects that his regency will be short and then he can return to\\nWinterfell.\\nLittlefinger arrives and congratulates Ned for being named Protector of the Realm. When asked how he knows,\\nLittlefinger states that Varys told him and that Ned has just confirmed it. Ned damns Varys and his birds and states\\nthat he does not trust him. Littlefinger declares that Ned is learning. Ned says he knows the secret that \\nJon Arryn\\nwas murdered for. Littlefinger\\'s lack of reaction to the truth shows that he obviously knew the secret all along.\\nNed declares his intention to offer the throne to Stannis, but Littlefinger says he would be wise to bow to \\nJoffrey\\n.\\nStannis is not a friend of Ned or Littlefinger; even his brothers cannot stand him because he is hard and unyielding.\\nStannis will appoint his own Hand and Small Council, and his ascension will mean war for the realm. Stannis will\\nseek the heads of Cersei and the children to secure his position on the \\nIron Throne\\n (an act that will incite \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n and the houses sworn to \\nCasterly Rock\\n to an uprising), those of Lords \\nTyrell\\n and \\nRedwyne\\n as revenge for\\nthe \\nSiege of Storm\\'s End\\n, and even Lord \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n for his \\nrebellion\\n. According to Littlefinger, anyone who\\nstood by the \\nTargaryens\\n during \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n or rose with the Greyjoys will have cause to fear Stannis\\' ascent\\nto the throne.\\nLittlefinger proposes another course of action: that Ned make his peace with the Lannisters, wed \\nSansa\\n to Joffrey,\\nRobb\\n to \\nMyrcella\\n, and \\nArya\\n to \\nTommen\\n and rule as Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey\\ncomes of age in four years’ time. This should be sufficient time to deal with Stannis and, should Joffrey prove\\nunsuitable, they can reveal the truth of his parentage and place Renly on the throne. Ned declares that what\\nLittlefinger is proposing is treason. Littlefinger replies that it will only be treason if they lose. Ned tells him that he\\nforgets Jon Arryn, \\nJory Cassel\\n, and the attempt to kill \\nBran\\n. Littlefinger states that the only thing he forgot was that\\nhe was talking to a \\nStark\\n.\\nNed declares that he is going to call on the aid Littlefinger promised \\nCatelyn\\n. Cersei has a dozen knights and 100\\n\\nmen-at-arms, enough to overwhelm his household guard. Littlefinger then points out there are lords that have no\\nlove for the \\nLannisters\\n that have guards. Ned states they are not enough—he needs Littlefinger to secure him the\\nCity Watch of King\\'s Landing\\n. Littlefinger insists that when the Hand proclaims one king and the Queen another,\\nthe Gold Cloaks will side with the one who pays better. With that in mind, Littlefinger states that he will meet with\\nCity Watch Commander \\nJanos Slynt\\n with a bribe of 6,000 \\ngold dragons\\n.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard XII\\n↑\\nDaenerys V\\n ←\\nEddard XIII\\n→ \\nJon VI\\n↓\\nEddard XIV\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 48: Jon VI\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n - godswood in the \\nhaunted forest\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon V\\n↑\\nEddard XIII\\n ←\\nJon VI\\n→ \\nEddard XIV\\n↓\\nJon VII\\nJon\\n is disgusted to learn that he will be a steward, not a ranger. \\nSam\\n convinces Jon that being the \\nLord\\nCommander’s\\n steward is actually an honor meant to groom him for command. Jon and Sam are taken to a \\ngodswood\\nbeyond the Wall\\n to say their vows before the \\nold gods\\n. After they have taken their vows, \\nGhost\\n returns with a human\\nhand in his jaws.\\nSynopsis\\nJon\\n is eating breakfast when \\nSam\\n excitedly tells that he has been passed out of training with Jon and the rest. Jon\\nfeigns surprise and Sam explains that he will be working for \\nMaester\\n \\nAemon\\n, who needs somebody who can read\\nand write to work in the library and with the birds. Sam is concerned about getting to the \\nsept\\n in time, otherwise the\\nofficers may change their minds. When they arrive at the sept the other recruits are genuinely shocked to see Sam,\\nbut no one dares to say a word.\\nAll the officers arrive together. \\nLord Commander\\n \\nJeor Mormont\\n makes his customary speech about taking vows and\\nbeing a member of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n. Mormont asks if any wish to leave before taking their vows, but no one does.\\nThen Mormont asks if any of them follow the \\nold gods\\n and Jon speaks up. The recruits whisper that there is no\\ngodswood\\n at \\nthe Wall\\n. Mormont confirms that \\nCastle Black\\n has no need of a godswood since the \\nhaunted forest\\nbeyond the Wall stands as it did in the \\nDawn Age\\n and there is a \\nweirwood\\n grove half a league from the castle. It is\\nthen that Sam speaks up that he also wants to swear his vows before the \\nheart tree\\n, despite being born into the \\nFaith\\nof the Seven\\n. When Ser \\nJaremy Rykker\\n questions why Sam would forsake the gods of his \\nHouse\\n, Sam declares that\\nthe Night’s Watch is his House now and the Seven have never answered his prayers.\\nAt the end of the ceremony, the Lord Commander announces the assignments: \\nHalder\\n and \\nAlbett\\n to the builders;\\nGrenn\\n, \\nPypar\\n, \\nTodder\\n, and \\nMatthar\\n to the rangers; Samwell, \\nDareon\\n, and Jon to the stewards. Jon is flabbergasted\\nand believes there must be a mistake, but when he sees Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\n’s black eyes studying him he knows it is\\nan intentional snub. The Lord Commander pronounces his last words and leaves. The Firsts call the recruits from\\neach of the groups.\\nAfter the rest are gone, Lord Steward \\nBowen Marsh\\n states that Sam will work in the library and rookery with\\nMaester Aemon, since \\nChett\\n has been reassigned to the kennels. Dareon will be sent to \\nEastwatch\\n to work with the\\nmerchants. Jon will be personal steward to the Lord Commander at Mormont\\'s own request. Jon sarcastically\\nsuggests a number of menial duties for himself and is told “certainly” and given several more duties. When Jon asks\\nif they take him for a servant, Maester Aemon answers that they took him for a man of the Night’s Watch, though\\nperhaps they were wrong.\\nOutside in the yard, Jon rants about the unfairness of his appointment, since he is a better swordsman and rider.\\nDareon is angered by Jon’s tantrum, since he himself was unfairly sent to the Wall for a false accusation. Sam quiets\\nJon by telling him the Lord Commander probably intends to groom him for command. Sam explains that \\nhis father\\nonce insisted that he be at his side for all important events but once he fell out of favor his father no longer cared.\\nSuddenly Jon is ashamed; Sam has accepted his situation like a man, while he has been playing the boy. Jon admits\\nthat Sam is right and agrees to take his vows.\\n\\nLate that afternoon, they proceed through the cold tunnel under the Wall and through three gates that Bowen Marsh\\nmust unlock. When they are finally outside again, Sam worries about the \\nwildlings\\n but is told they have never come\\nthis close to the Wall. Never-the-less, they are joined by an escort of rangers. Jon whistles and \\nGhost\\n lopes out of the\\ntunnel and then into the woods. The haunted forest is much like the \\nWolfswood\\n around \\nWinterfell\\n, but its feel is\\nmuch more ominous. It is dusk when they finally arrive at a clearing with nine weirwoods, a number unheard of\\nsouth of the Wall. Sam looks at the faces on each of the trees and says that he can feel the old gods watching.\\nAs night falls, Jon and Sam kneel and say their vows together:\\nNight gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands,\\nfather no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in\\nthe darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the\\ndawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to\\nthe Night\\'s Watch, for this night and all nights to come.\\nWhen they are finished, Bowen Marsh declares that they knelt as boys and now rise as men of the Night’s Watch.\\nThe gnarled forester \\nDywen\\n says they should be getting back because there is something in the night he dislikes.\\nThen Ghost returns, his red eyes and white face eerily like the faces carved in the weirwoods.

When\\nLittlefinger\\n arrives wearing the same clothes as the previous day, he declares that the task Ned set him is done.\\nVarys\\n arrives next with news that Lord \\nRenly\\n has left the city along with Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n and fifty retainers,\\nslipping out a postern gate an hour before dawn and riding south for \\nStorm\\'s End\\n or \\nHighgarden\\n. Ned is\\ndiscomforted by the news, since he had remained hopeful of Renly’s support.\\nNed entrusts Ser \\nBarristan\\n to read the writ naming him Protector of the Realm until the heir comes of age. Ned\\nthinks to himself that the \\ntrue heir\\n is already of age, but says nothing; he does not trust Varys or Pycelle and Ser\\nBarristan is honor bound to protect the boy he thinks is his rightful king. The need for deceit bothers him, but Ned\\nknows he must keep Cersei’s secret until he is firmly established as regent. There will be plenty of time to deal with\\nthe succession when his daughters are safe and Stannis has arrived with his forces. Ned asks the council to proclaim\\nhim Protector of the Realm as Robert wished. Before anyone can reply, the meeting is interrupted by \\nFat Tom\\n and\\nthe royal steward with news that the king demands the small council’s immediate presence in the throne room. Ned\\nis unsurprised that Cersei would strike quickly, and orders Tom to assemble an escort.\\nEscorted by eight men-at-arms and supported by Littlefinger, Ned makes his way across the yard, reassured by the\\nnumber of Stark guardsmen on the walls. Inside the throne room, Joffrey sits the \\nIron Throne\\n with Cersei and his\\nsiblings below, guarded by \\nSandor Clegane\\n and all of the \\nKingsguard\\n except \\nJaime Lannister\\n and Ser Barristan, who\\nhas just arrived with Ned. Behind the throne stand twenty Lannister guardsmen armed with swords, and along the\\nwalls are a hundred \\ngold cloaks\\n armed with spears, enough to outnumber the Lannisters five to one. At the sight of\\nthe gold cloaks, Ned is encouraged that Littlefinger has kept his promise.\\n\\nJoffrey stands and commands that the council make arrangements for his coronation which he wishes held within the\\nfortnight. The young king then declares that today he will accept oaths of fealty from his loyal councilors. Ned has\\nVarys deliver Robert’s will to Cersei. The queen glances at the words then tears it up, questioning if Ned meant a\\npiece of paper to be his shield. The honorable Ser Barristan exclaims that those were the king’s words, but Cersei\\ndismissively declares that they have a new king now. Then Cersei advises Ned that if he bends the knee and swears\\nfealty to Joffrey he will be allowed to retire peacefully to Winterfell. Instead, bound by his honor, Ned declares that\\nJoffrey has no right to the throne and that \\nStannis\\n is the true heir.\\nJoffrey bursts out in anger and Cersei orders Ser Barristan to seize Ned as a traitor. The old knight hesitates and is\\nquickly surrounded by Ned’s guardsmen. At Cersei’s command, the Hound and the Lannister guardsmen draw their\\nswords to aid in the arrest. Ned responds by ordering \\nJanos Slynt\\n to have his gold cloaks take the queen and her\\nchildren into custody. As Ned is stating he wants no bloodshed, a gold cloak shoves a spear through Tomard’s back.\\nA brief fight ensues, quickly killing all of Ned’s guardsmen.

Syrio calls his\\nstrikes and Arya blocks each in turn until one hits her breast from the wrong side and Syrio says she is dead. Arya\\ncomplains that Syrio cheated by lying. The swordsman says only his words lied, not his eyes or his arm, but she was\\nnot seeing. Arya insists that she watched him every second, but Syrio declares that watching is not seeing. To\\nillustrate his point, Syrio tells her how he became the \\nFirst Sword of Braavos\\n.\\nSyrio explains that there were many who were stronger, faster, or younger, but he was the best because he could see\\nthe truth. After the death of the previous First Sword, many \\nbravos\\n were called to the \\nSealord\\n and as many were sent\\naway. Finally, Syrio was called before the Sealord, who had a fat yellow cat on his lap. The Sealord said the animal\\nhad been brought to him from a faraway land by one of his captains and asked if Syrio had ever seen her like. Syrio\\nreplied that he had seen a thousand like him in the alleys of Braavos, and that same day Syrio was named the First\\nSword. Arya says she does not understand. Syrio explains that the cat was just an ordinary one, but the other men all\\nexpected a marvelous beast, so that was what they saw. In addition, the Sealord had called it “her” and that was what\\nthe others saw, even though it was clearly a tomcat. Arya understands then, and Syrio tells her to uses her senses\\nfirst and her mind second. Then he declares that when they get to Winterfell it will be time to put “\\nNeedle\\n” in her\\nhand.\\nThe great wooden doors fly open to reveal five \\nLannister guardsmen\\n and Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n of the \\nKingsguard\\n. Meryn\\norders Arya to come with him to see her father. Arya is about to follow when Syrio stops her and asks why Lord\\nEddard\\n would send Lannister men instead of his own. Arya immediately realizes the truth of Syrio’s statement and\\npicks up her stick sword. When Meryn insists he is trustworthy as a member of the Kingsguard, Arya replies that so\\nis \\nthe Kingslayer\\n.\\nDispensing with the charade, Meryn orders Arya seized. When a guard approaches Arya, Syrio stands before her.\\nThe guard orders Syrio out of the way, calling him an old man. Syrio declares his name and that they will be\\nspeaking to him with more respect. Unimpressed, the guard goes for his sword but Syrio is faster and breaks the\\nman’s fingers with his wooden sword. Then Meryn orders the Lannister guards to attack and Syrio instructs Arya to\\ngo to her father. As the guards attack Syrio, Arya can see that Syrio was only toying with her during their practices;\\nby the time Arya reaches the far end of the hall, Syrio is surrounded by five dead or dying men. Then Meryn, in his\\nheavy plate armor, draws his sword. Syrio tells Arya to go, but she watches as the First Sword lands many blows on\\nthe knight\\'s armor before Meryn breaks Syrio’s wooden sword. Arya turns and runs through the kitchen, crying.\\nAs she runs, Arya thinks of everything Syrio has told her: “Swift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. Quick as a snake.\\nCalm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than\\nswords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords…”\\n\\nHer sword grip is slick with sweat when she reaches the turret stair. She wonders if she should go up or down. She\\nthen remembers Syrio telling her to do the unexpected, so she goes down to a cavernous cellar that she knows is a\\ndead end. She climbs up to a window. Outside the window she can see the stout door to the \\nTower of the Hand\\n is\\nsplintered, one of her father’s guards lies dead on the stairs, and she can hear fighting. She thinks about when she\\nheard a man say that if one \\nHand\\n can die, so can another. As she moves, Arya pretends that she is catching cats but\\nthen realizes that she is the cat and is dead if they catch her.\\nOutside the stable she finds \\nHullen\\n lying on the ground, looking dead. When she approaches him, he opens his eyes\\nand tells her to warn her father before dying. Inside, Arya finds more dead men including \\nDesmond\\n, who said he\\nwould protect her father. There is only a single Lannister body, and Arya remembers Desmond\\'s claim that every\\nnorthman\\n was worth ten \\nsouthrons\\n. Losing her temper, Arya kicks Desmond\\'s body and calls him a liar.\\nAs Arya collects horse tack, she finds her broken chest on the ground. She gropes around for \\nNeedle\\n. Just as her\\nfingers touch the sword a stable boy appears behind her with a pitchfork. She asks him to help her saddle a horse,\\nsaying her father will reward him. The boy responds that her father is dead and that \\nthe queen\\n will reward him.\\nWhen he grabs her arm, Arya forgets all of Syrio’s lessons, only remembering the lesson that \\nJon Snow\\n taught her.\\nShe sticks the pointy end through the boy’s belly, killing him.\\nAs she saddles her mare, Arya realizes that the gates will be closed and the guards will let no one out; she has to go\\nanother way. Immediately she wonders if she can find the room with the monsters again. However, to do that she\\nmust cross the open yard and the walls are crowded with more \\ngold cloaks\\n and soldiers than she has ever seen.\\nReciting Syrio’s words to herself, she walks slowly across the yard to the empty royal sept, hiding Needle under the\\ncloak she has put on; it is the scariest thing she has ever done. Taking two of the candles in the sept, she crawls out a\\nback window.\\nIt takes Arya more than an hour to find the room: crawling through windows, over walls, and through cellars. She\\ngoes back to light her candle and returns. Now the monsters do not frighten her. Neither do the rats in the dungeons.\\nThe \\ncrypts of Winterfell\\n were scarier, and she and her siblings were once taken there by \\nRobb\\n to visit their own\\nwaiting tombs. Then Jon had suddenly appeared covered in flour, pretending to be a ghost, but that had not scared\\nher.

There she is informed that her father is\\na traitor and is persuaded to write letters to her relatives explaining what has happened.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa\\n is locked in a room with \\nJeyne Poole\\n, who does nothing but cry for \\nher father\\n. Sansa, thinking Jeyne was\\nacting childish, has told her friend that she would ask \\nQueen Cersei\\n to let her see her father, but it does not seem to\\nhave helped.\\nSansa herself wept the first day. She was used to the sound of fighting in \\nWinterfell\\n, but knowing it was real—with\\nangry shouts and the moans of dying men—was different. At first she pleaded for news and to see someone familiar,\\nsuch as her father or her \\ngallant prince\\n, but she got no answer. Then they shoved Jeyne into the room and she\\nclaimed they were killing everyone and that there were bodies on the steps. The next day the fighting was over and\\nLannister\\n guardsmen patrolled the walls. The servants who bring them food and clothes refused to answer any\\nquestions. At sunset they heard the bells tolling from the \\nGreat Sept of Baelor\\n proclaiming King \\nRobert\\n’s death.\\nSansa is afraid for her beautiful prince and her father and at night she dreams of Joffrey on the throne with her\\nbeside him with everyone she knows coming before them to bend their knee.\\nSer \\nBoros Blount\\n comes for her on the third day. Resolved to be a lady no matter what, Sansa complements the ugly\\nknight. He leads her out of Maegor’s Holdfast, where she sees a body impaled on the spikes of the dry moat. Rather\\nthan being taken to the queen’s apartments, Sansa is brought to the council chamber and presented to Queen Cersei\\nand the \\nsmall council\\n, though her prince is not there as she was hoping.\\nThe queen asks if she has been well taken care of and Sansa affirms that they have, though no one will tell them\\nwhat happened. Sansa\\'s use of the word \"us\" leads to confusion until Sansa explains that Jeyne is staying with her.\\nCersei is surprised to discover that Jeyne has been put in with Sansa and expresses concern about what absurd tales\\nJeyne might have told Sansa. Remembering her promise, Sansa asks about Vayon Poole, unable to imagine anyone\\nkilling a steward who does not even carry a sword. Cersei asks what to do with Jeyne and \\nLittlefinger\\n states that he\\nwill find a place for her. The queen then instructs that Jeyne be taken to Littlefinger’s apartments and that saying\\nLittlefinger will take her to her father should calm her down. Sansa asks where Vayon is and where Jeyne is being\\nsent, wondering why Littlefinger must be involved, but Cersei brushes off the question.\\nCersei tells Sansa that Joffrey loves her, but that her father is a traitor. Varys and Pycelle explain that Lord Eddard,\\nwho had sworn to protect King Robert’s children, was planning to turn the kingdom over to \\nStannis Baratheon\\n. Then\\nCersei shows Sansa the letter her father wrote to Stannis, which has been taken off \\nthe captain of his guard\\n. Sansa\\ninsists that it cannot be true because her father was the king’s friend.\\nCersei informs Sansa that she cannot allow the daughter of a traitor to marry her son. Sansa is overwhelmed by the\\nunfairness of taking away her beloved because of something her father did. Cersei states that she knew Sansa was\\ninnocent from the moment Sansa came to her with Lord Eddard’s plan to take her away. Sansa insists that she did\\nthis because she loves Joffrey, remembering that she felt very wicked sneaking away to the queen. She had wanted\\n\\nto go to the king, but loud and often drunk King Robert had always frightened her. She had also believed the king\\nwould probably have just sent her back to her father. After having informed the queen of her father’s plans, Sansa\\nwas locked in the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast, under guard. A few hours later the fighting had started.\\nThe small council discusses whether Sansa could also turn out to be traitorous. \\nVarys\\n and \\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\nopine that the child of a traitor is also likely to become traitorous. Littlefinger points out that Sansa reminds him of\\nher mother\\n rather than her father. Queen Cersei expresses doubt that Sansa can be trusted since \\nher sister\\n turned her\\nwolf on Joffrey. Sansa replies that she is nothing like her traitorous sister; she only wants to be Joffrey’s wife.\\nQueen Cersei then suggests that if the rest of Sansa\\'s kin prove loyal it would rest some of the council’s fears.\\nTherefore, Cersei asks that Sansa write to her lady mother and her brother \\nRobb\\n explaining how Lord Eddard\\nbetrayed his king. Sansa does not know what to say, but Cersei assures her that they will provide her with the words.\\nThe important thing is that the \\nStarks\\n keep the King’s Peace; otherwise it will go hard on them and on Sansa. Sansa\\nis also told write that she is being well cared for and that her family must come to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n and pledge fealty\\nto Joffrey.\\nSansa asks to see her father, but is told that if she is truly loyal she should not want to see him. Sansa says she is\\nconcerned about him and what will happen to him. She is told that her father is well and that the king will decide his\\npunishment. Sansa realizes that the king is now her gallant Joffrey, whom she knows would never hurt her father\\nand who is sure to listen to her pleas. Perhaps her father will only be exiled for a few years. However, if her mother\\nor Robb did something treasonous it will all go wrong.\\nSansa agrees to write the letters and ends up writing four: to her mother, her brother Robb, her \\nAunt Lysa\\n, and her\\ngrandfather \\nHoster Tully\\n.

Both of the corpses have the same pale skin, black\\nhands, and staring blue eyes.\\nRemarking that they are only two of the six men that Benjen took with him, \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n asks Ser\\nJaremy how two men could die so close to \\nthe Wall\\n without the rangers knowing; Othor even wears a hunting horn.\\nSer Jaremy insists that no horn was blown or it would have been heard. He goes on to complain that he does not\\nhave sufficient men to patrol and mentions the Lord Commander’s own order to stay close to the Wall following\\nBenjen’s disappearance.\\nMormont asks how the men died. A quick examination shows that Jafer was killed by an axe blow to the neck and\\nthat Othor is riddled with wounds. The old forester \\nDywen\\n suggests that Othor was known to carry an axe. Ser\\nJaremy points out that \\nwildlings\\n carry axes as well, suggesting it to be the work of \\nMance Rayder\\n, which Mormont\\nfinds questionable so close to the Wall. Ser Jaremy asks who else it could have been. Jon knows the answer, they all\\ndo, but \\nthe Others\\n have been gone for 8,000 years if they ever existed at all.\\nMormont declares that if Benjen had been attacked so close to \\nCastle Black\\n, he would have returned for more men\\nbefore going after the attackers. Ser Jaremy suggests that, sometime in the six months that Benjen has been gone, his\\nparty might have been attacked by wildlings and that Othor and Jafer were only the last survivors. To support this\\nclaim, the knight points out that the two bodies cannot have been dead for more than a day.\\nSam\\n now speaks up. The fat boy is present to be the eyes of blind old Maester \\nAemon\\n, but Jon had to force the\\ncowardly boy to even look at the bodies. Now Sam insists that Ser Jaremy is wrong about the bodies. At the Lord\\nCommander’s urging, Sam points out that the blood in the corpses’ veins is dry and crusty, as if they have been dead\\nfor a long time. However, the bodies do not stink and have not begun to decompose; they are also untouched by\\nmaggots or scavengers. Suspicious of the untouched nature of the corpses, Mormont orders \\nChett\\n to bring one of the\\nhounds closer, but no matter how hard he tries, the hound fights to stay away from the bodies. In addition, Sam\\npoints out that there are no pools of blood to indicate the men were killed there, indicating that the bodies have been\\nmoved. The old forester Dywen and Ser Jaremy also note that they do not recall either Othor or Jafer having blue\\neyes.\\nSeveral of the other rangers urge that the bodies should be burned, but the Lord Commander wants Maester Aemon\\n\\nto examine them further. It proves impossible to tie the bodies to the horses, who panic at their proximity to the\\ncorpses, so they are carried back on crude slings.\\nLord Commander Mormont orders Ser Jaremy to search the area for ten leagues around, using hunters and foresters\\nif he does not have enough men. If Benjen or any more of his men are around he will have them found, and if there\\nis anyone else around, he will have them found as well.\\nAs they ride back, Jon follows the Lord Commander and finds that it is too warm, with the Wall weeping copiously.\\nThis weather is called by the old men “Sprit Summer,” when the season is giving up its ghosts. This means that\\nwinter is coming, and a long summer means a long winter. Jon now thinks back to the stories that \\nOld Nan\\n told of\\nthe Others coming riding in the dark and everything, including cities, falling before them and how they feed their\\nservants on the flesh of human children.\\nWhen they finally see the Wall, Lord Commander Mormont calls for Sam and compliments him, telling him that he\\nis fat but not stupid.\\nWhen they arrive at the gate, the Lord Commander is told by \\nBowen Marsh\\n, the Lord Steward, that there has been a\\nraven. Mormont orders the bodies put in a storage room. Meanwhile, Jon notices everyone is looking at him and\\nknows something is wrong. Jon searches out his friends and \\nPyp\\n tells him that King \\nRobert\\n is dead. Jon wonders if\\nhis father will now return to \\nWinterfell\\n and decides that when he visits he will ask for the truth about his mother. His\\nfriends ask about the bodies, but Jon only says they were queer.\\nAs he walks to the Lord Commander’s Tower Jon notices the stares again, and when he arrives he is told that\\nMormont wants to see him. When he enters, Mormont surprises him with an offer of wine and asks him to sit. Jon\\nstates that it is grievous news about his father and the king which Mormont confirms. The Lord Commander tells\\nJon that it is said that the king loved to hunt and that the things we love destroy us every time. He then states that if\\nit had not been for the love a woman, his son \\nJorah\\n would not have thought to sell poachers into slavery. Jon does\\nnot understand, but the Lord Commander gives no answer, only a repeated order to sit and drink.\\nJon is told that his father has been imprisoned as a traitor for plotting with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to\\nPrince Joffrey\\n. Jon denies that his father could ever be a traitor, but then recalls that he fathered a bastard; where was\\nthe honor in that? The Lord Commander explains that he plans to use his contacts in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n to ensure that\\nEddard is allowed to take the black; they could use men of Eddard’s ability on the Wall. Jon thinks that it would be a\\nterrible injustice to strip his father of \\nWinterfell\\n but knows it would be preferable to death. Then he remembers\\nJoffrey mocking \\nRobb Stark\\n and Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n, and asks if the king will listen. Mormont replies that Joffrey\\nmay listen to \\nhis mother\\n, though it is too bad \\nTyrion Lannister\\n is not there. Mormont declares it a bad thing that\\nJon’s “mother” took Tyrion captive, but Jon haughtily reminds him that \\nCatelyn Stark\\n is not his mother. Jon then\\nasks about his sisters and Mormont promises to ask about them. Then Mormont states that he hopes Jon is not going\\nto do anything stupid; his duty is now here and his old life ended when he took the black. He then dismisses Jon,\\ntelling him that he can help write the letter the next day.\\nDespite Mormont’s words, Jon remains convinced the Starks are his family and wonders how it cannot be his\\nconcern. He also wonders whether his father could truly be a traitor. At the evening meal Jon realizes that everyone\\nknows about his father’s arrest. When his friends rally to him and assure him that they do not believe the stories, Jon\\nrealizes that they are now his brothers as much as Robb and \\nBran\\n and \\nRickon\\n. Then Jon hears Ser \\nAlliser\\n mocking\\nboth Jon and his father. In the blink of an eye, Jon jumps over the table and attacks Ser Alliser with a knife, but his\\nfriends hold him back and he is marched to his sleeping cell. Later, Mormont visits him and reminds Jon that he told\\nhim not to do anything stupid. Now the high officers must meet to decide his fate. A guard is left at his door, and his\\nfriends are not permitted to visit him, though Ghost is allowed to stay.\\nThat night, Jon wakes to Ghost scratching at the door, and it is very cold. When he opens his door, Jon finds his door\\nguard dead and he hears noises coming from the Lord Commander’s chamber. Taking the dead guard’s sword, Jon\\nascends to the Lord Commander\\'s chamber where he finds the door open and \\nMormont\\'s raven\\n squawking. He sees\\nthe shadow of a man in black with icy blue eyes going into the Lord Commander’s sleeping chamber.\\nGhost attacks the man, and Jon pulls down the curtains so that he can see. The man has his black hands around\\nGhost’s throat. Jon cuts off an arm with his sword and Ghost is able to wrench free. The next stroke cuts halfway\\n\\nthrough the man’s face, and now Jon recognizes Othor. The severed hand claws at his calf and Jon pulls it off. Ghost\\nattacks the hand while Jon strikes the undead man in the neck, but Othor slams into him, knocking him down. In the\\nfall, Jon loses his sword. Othor is on top of Jon and attempting to choke him, but is finally pulled off by Ghost. As\\nhe regains his feet, Jon spots the Lord Commander standing naked in the doorway with an oil lamp as the hand\\napproaches him. Jon grabs the oil lamp from the Lord Commander and throws it on the drapes, setting them afire.\\nThen Jon grabs the burning drapes and throws them onto Othor, praying that the \\nwight\\n will burn.\\nNavigation:\\nJon VI\\n↑\\nSansa IV\\n ←\\nJon VII\\n→ \\nBran VI\\n↓\\nJon VIII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 53: Bran VI\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran V\\n↑\\nJon VII\\n ←\\nBran VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys VI\\n↓\\nBran VII\\nBran\\n watches the \\nKarstarks\\n arrive, then goes to the \\ngodswood\\n to pray. He is interrupted by \\nOsha\\n, who tells him\\nabout the \\nold gods\\n and the \\nOthers\\n. She insists that \\nRobb\\n should be marching north not south. Bran passes on her\\nadvice to Maester \\nLuwin\\n. Then Robb marches his army south.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n watches from a guard turret with \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n’s fareye as the \\nKarstark\\n forces arrive at \\nWinterfell\\n. When\\nRobb\\n heard the news that \\ntheir father\\n had been taken captive in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, he called the Stark bannermen\\ntogether for war. The Karstarks are the last to arrive: three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot lead by\\nLord \\nRickard Karstark\\n with his sons \\nHarrion\\n, \\nEddard\\n, and \\nTorrhen\\n riding beside him. The Karstarks are said to have\\nStark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but the fierce men do not look like Starks to Bran.\\nBran has not been allowed to leave the castle since the \\nincident\\n in the \\nwolfswood\\n. Robb insists that there are no men\\navailable to guard him and is not dissuaded by Bran’s argument that \\nSummer\\n will protect him. The incident in the\\nWolfswood shames Bran as he is not able to protect himself; even \\nRickon\\n would have been able to kick them. A\\nyear ago he would have visited the village anyway, climbing over the walls, but now he can only watch with\\nMaester Luwin and \\nHodor\\n.\\nMaester Luwin has taught Bran all the banners and now he has faces to associate with them. Bran asks how many\\nknights there are and Luwin tells Bran that there are over 12,000 men, but only 300 knights because \\nthe North\\n holds\\nto the \\nold gods\\n and knights are anointed in a sept of the \\nFaith of the Seven\\n. However, Luwin assures him, \"a man’s\\nworth is not marked by a \\nser\\n before his name.\" Bran asks when they will leave and is told they must leave soon or\\nthe countryside will be eaten clean. Robb has a long way to go and the fighting has started. More men will join Robb\\nas he travels south.\\nBran tells Hodor that he does not want to watch anymore. Maester Luwin reminds Bran that his brother is busy\\ngreeting the Karstarks, but Bran assures him that he wants to visit the \\ngodswood\\n. Hodor now carries Bran in a basket\\nstrapped to his back, an idea Luwin got from the baskets used by the serving women to carry firewood. Being\\ncarried this way does not shame Bran the same as being carried like a baby, although Hodor sometimes forgets Bran\\nis on his back when going through doorways.\\nWhen Bran exits the castle there are Karstark men arriving. Some men mock him, but Bran has been warned of this\\nby the maester. His attitude is to let them mock since he does not want to stay in his bedroom. Bran calls for\\nSummer, and the Karstark horses reel as the \\ndirewolf\\n goes by.\\nWhen Bran arrives in the godswood, he pulls himself out of his seat on Hodor’s back using a branch of the\\nweirwood\\n. Then he lets Hodor lower him down beside the water and says he wants to be alone with Summer. Bran\\nhas been finding himself drawn more to the \\nheart tree\\n and now he takes comfort from its deep red eyes; the old gods\\nare watching over him. He feels safe and it gives him time to think, which he has been doing a lot of recently.\\nBran prays for Robb not to go away, for the safety of his family, and for \\nRickon\\n to understand. Rickon has grown\\nwild and violent since he learned that Robb was leaving. Once Rickon disappeared and, when he was finally found\\n\\ndown in the crypts, the youngest Stark had slashed at the men with a sword and \\nShaggydog\\n bit \\nGage\\n on the arm and\\ntook a chunk out of \\nMikken\\n’s thigh. It took Robb and \\nGrey Wind\\n to bring Shaggydog under control. After that\\nFarlen\\n chained Shaggydog in the kennels and now Rickon cries even more.\\nLuwin and Bran have both asked Robb to stay but he refuses, saying he has no choice. Bran believes this is only half\\na lie because Robb could send someone else to guard \\nthe Neck\\n. Robb’s response was that their father would not send\\nothers to die while he stayed behind the walls of Winterfell. Robb denies all who request being given supreme battle\\ncommand. Many of the lords try to test Robb by making demands, but he is able to handle them much as his father\\ndid and bend them to his will, even when anger flares. When \\nGreatjon Umber\\n demanded the right to command, he\\ndrew his sword against Robb. \\nGrey Wind\\n immediately reacted by biting off two of his fingers. Since the incident,\\nthe Greatjon has been Robb’s staunchest supporter. That night, Robb came to Bran’s bedchamber pale and shaken.\\nRobb also told Bran that the most frightening bannerman is \\nRoose Bolton\\n, who never says a word but only looks at\\nhim. When Bolton does this, all Robb can think of is the room in the \\nDreadfort\\n where the Boltons hang the skins of\\ntheir enemies. Bran states that this is only a story of \\nOld Nan\\n’s, but then asks for confirmation.\\nThere are many horrible stories that come with travelers, and it is impossible to say which is real, although some are\\nobviously untrue. Then the letter from Sansa arrived with the seal of House Stark. After Robb had read the letter he\\ncrushed it. Sansa had said nothing of Arya and Robb asked what is wrong with her. Bran replied that Sansa has lost\\nher wolf, remembering the day four of the guardsmen returned with bones of \\nLady\\n. They buried the bones in the\\ncemetery with the faithful servants of Winterfell; she went south and only her bones returned, like Lord \\nRickard\\nStark\\n, \\nBrandon Stark\\n, and two hundred men, and none returned. Now \\ntheir father\\n, \\nArya\\n, \\nSansa\\n, \\nJory Cassel\\n, and \\nFat\\nTom\\n have gone south and not come back and later \\nmother\\n and Ser \\nRodrik\\n left and have not come back. Now Robb is\\ngoing south and it frightens Bran. Bran prays that the gods look after Robb and his men going south, and that they\\ndefeat the \\nLannisters\\n and bring Father back.\\nBran is surprised by words from \\nOsha\\n who is apparently able to move quietly in the shackles she has to wear. She\\ntells him that she can hear the gods answering him. When Summer comes around the pool to sniff her, she flinches.\\nBran calls Summer back and asks Osha, whom he has not seen since she was taken captive, what she is doing here.\\nThe \\nspearwife\\n replies they are her gods too and the only gods beyond \\nthe Wall\\n. Bran notes that she looks more\\nwomanly with her longer hair and her dress of brown roughspun. She tells Bran that \\nGage\\n lets her out to do her\\nprayers from time to time while she lets him do what he wants under her skirt when he feels the need; it is nothing to\\nher, she likes the smell of flour on his hands and he is gentler than \\nStiv\\n.\\nShe offers to leave but Bran asks her to stay and tell him what she means about hearing the gods. She tells him to\\nopen his ears, to which Bran replies that it is only the wind. Osha asks him who sends the winds, insisting that the\\nold gods can see him and hear his words. Bran asks what they say and Osha replies that they are sad because they\\ncannot help his brother in the South. The old gods have no power there because all the weirwoods were destroyed\\nthousands of years ago; they cannot watch over his brother because they have no eyes.\\nNow Bran listens and it seems there is sadness in the wind, but then he only hears Hodor, who arrives naked from\\nhis bath in the hot springs. When Osha sees Hodor she declares that his size denotes \\ngiant\\n blood in him. When Bran\\ntells her that Maester Luwin taught him that there are no more giants, Osha tells him that the Maester should ride\\nbeyond the \\nWall\\n. The giants sometimes breed with men \\nbeyond the Wall\\n, producing half-breeds, though it goes\\nmuch worse on the women that have sex with a giant. She then asks Bran if he knows what she is talking about and\\nhe tells her does, as he has seen animals mating.\\nAs Hodor leaves to dress at Bran’s command, Bran admits that he is very big. Osha confirms there are giants beyond\\nthe Wall, and worse than giants: when men leave their fires they often do not come back, or sometimes they come\\nback as \\nwights\\n with blue eyes and cold black hands. Osha explains that she tried to tell Robb, Maester Luwin, and\\neven \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n of this, but they would not listen. She asks Bran why else she would flee south in the company\\nof Stiv and the rest of those fools. She goes on to declare that \\nMance Rayder\\n, once a sworn brother of the \\nNight\\'s\\nWatch\\n, thinks he can fight the wights. Osha states that she, unlike Mance, is of the north, from a long line of the \\nfree\\nfolk\\n. Osha laments again that she cannot get Robb to listen and Bran suggests that perhaps Robb will listen to him.\\nOsha is dubious but gives Bran the message:\\nYou tell him this, m’lord. You tell him he’s bound on marching the wrong way. It\\'s north he should be taking\\nhis swords. North, not south.\\n\\nBran does not get to tell his brother this, because Robb takes his meal in the solar with the great lords to make final\\nplans for the march, while Bran has to act as the host to the Karstarks in the \\nGreat Hall\\n. When he arrives in the hall,\\nBran can feel the eyes on him and hears them murmuring about him being broken. He whispers under his breath that\\nhe wants to be a knight, which Maester Luwin overhears. He tells Bran that some call his order the “knights of the\\nmind,” and that Bran could forge a maester’s chain at the \\nCitadel\\n in \\nOldtown\\n. Bran states that he wants to learn\\nmagic and that the \\ncrow\\n promised he would fly. The maester says he can teach Bran many things but no one can\\nteach him magic. Bran replies that the \\nchildren of the forest\\n could teach him. Then he remembers what he promised\\nOsha, and tells the maester of the threat in the north. The maester promises to talk to Osha, but it is obvious even to\\nBran that what he has said has made little impression.\\nTwo days later, Robb and his army march south. Robb tells Bran that now he must be the lord, the Stark in\\nWinterfell. Bran—who has never felt so little, alone, or scared—does not know how to be a lord. He is told to listen\\nto Maester Luwin and to take care of Rickon who has refused to say goodbye, claiming that no one ever comes back.\\nRobb states that Mother will be home soon and promises to bring Father back. As Robb’s force leaves, Bran\\nremembers Osha’s words: he is marching the wrong way. Then he hears the cheers from the village, and thinks they\\nwill never cheer for him. All that seems to be left in Winterfell are women, children, old men, and Hodor.\\nNavigation:\\nBran V\\n↑\\nJon VII\\n ←\\nBran VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys VI\\n↓\\nBran VII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 54: Daenerys VI\\nPlace(s): \\nVaes Dothrak\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys V\\n↑\\nBran VI\\n ←\\nDaenerys VI\\n→ \\nCatelyn VIII\\n↓\\nDaenerys VII\\nDaenerys\\n is unable to convince \\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n to assault the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n to regain her throne. While Drogo is\\nhunting, Daenerys goes to the market where a wine merchant offers her a cask of wine. When Ser \\nJorah\\n insists that\\nthe merchant drink first, the merchant refuses and attempts to flee. When Drogo learns of the attempt to poison\\nDaenerys, he makes the decision to attack the Seven Kingdoms.\\nSynopsis\\nAfter taking his pleasure, \\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n arises from the sleeping mats and declares that the \\nStallion Who Mounts the\\nWorld\\n has no need of an \\niron chair\\n. \\nDaenerys\\n reminds him that it is prophesized that the Stallion will ride to the ends\\nof the earth, but Drogo responds that the earth ends at the black salt sea, which no horse can drink. Daenerys tries to\\nexplain ships to him, but Drogo is not interested and leaves to go hunting. She can only hope that if his hunting goes\\nwell he might return in a more receptive mood; maybe he will even kill a \\nhrakkar\\n, the white lion of the plains.\\nAlthough he is brave even by Dothraki standards, like all his people Drogo still fears the sea.\\nDaenerys sends for Ser \\nJorah\\n. When he arrives, she pleads for help convincing her husband to ride west. Ser Jorah\\nexplains that Drogo has never seen the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n and probably thinks of them as small islands like \\nLys\\n or\\nLorath\\n; the riches of the east seem a lot more tempting. He continues that she should have patience and not make \\nher\\nbrother\\n’s mistake. Ser Jorah promises that eventually they will go home. The word “home” saddens her when she\\nremembers that the Seven Kingdoms are a place she has never seen either, and she wonders if the \\ndosh khaleen\\n is\\nher future.\\nIn an attempt to cheer her up, Ser Jorah asks if she would like visit the \\nWestern Market\\n, where a great caravan has\\njust arrived and may carry a letter from Magister \\nIllyrio\\n. Daenerys likes this idea since it will be nice to see the\\ntreasures, to hear the sound of the \\nValyrian\\n language, and (since Drogo is gone) to travel in a litter; she does not\\nwant to appear weak in front of her husband by not riding a horse.\\nDaenerys finds the market quiet compared to the bazaars of the \\nFree Cities\\n. The caravans come from east and west\\nnot so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other. The Dothraki do not fully understand the concept of\\nbuying and selling, but the merchants are welcome as long as they do not disturb the peace or profane the \\nMother of\\nMountains\\n and give the traditional gifts to the \\ndosh khaleen\\n. Daenerys enjoys the wonder and magic of the \\nEastern\\nMarket\\n, with its strange foods and people, but the Western Market reminds her of home. She tells Ser Jorah about\\nhow she loved to play in the bazaars of the Free Cities when she was a little girl even though they seldom had\\nmoney to buy anything. She especially remembers the honeyfinger cakes of \\nTyrosh\\n. When she asks if they have\\nsuch cakes in the Seven Kingdoms, Ser Jorah is unable to say.\\nSer Jorah asks her pardon to seek out the merchant captain to ask about letters from Illyrio, but when Daenerys\\noffers to join him he is insistent that he go alone. Daenerys finds this curious and wonders if the knight plans to visit\\na brothel afterwards. Daenerys wanders joyfully around for half of the morning, even laughing for the first time\\nsince her brother’s death. As per Dothraki custom she receives several items as gifts and reciprocates with\\nmedallions from her belt.\\nTurning a corner, they come upon a wine merchant offering thimbles of wines. Daenerys accepts a taste of the wine,\\n\\nspeaking in Valyrian, which surprises the merchant, until \\nDoreah\\n steps up to declare all of Daenerys’ titles. The\\nmerchant immediately insists that the wine he was going to offer her is not worthy of a princess and offers her a cask\\nof his finest wine. Daenerys graciously accepts the cask, knowing that Drogo has acquired a taste for fine wine from\\nhis time in the Free Cities.\\nAs Daenerys is ordering the cask taken back to the litter, Ser Jorah appears and states he wants a taste of the wine.\\nThe wine merchant resists, insisting that Ser Jorah is not fit for such wine, but relents and pours two cups when Ser\\nJorah threatens him. Then Ser Jorah orders the merchant to drink. Instead, the merchant throws the cask at Daenerys\\nand flees. Ser Jorah pushes Daenerys out of the way and Doreah just barely catches her before she falls on her\\npregnant belly. \\nJhogo\\n uses his whip to trip the merchant. The ruckus brings a dozen caravan guards and the\\nmerchant captain running. The merchant captain seems to guess what has happened. He orders the merchant taken\\naway to await Khal Drogo and gives the merchant’s goods to Daenerys as a gift. Daenerys asks Ser Jorah how he\\nknew but the knight insists that he only suspected because the letter from Magister Illyrio had made him fearful. As\\nthey return, Daenerys notes that her baby is moving restlessly and she comforts him with words about being the\\nblood of the dragon.\\nWhen they get back to the hollow hummock that serves as her home, Daenerys orders the rest to leave her with Ser\\nJorah. The knight explains that the letter from Magister Illyrio brings news that \\nthe Usurper\\n has offered lands and a\\nlordship to anyone that kills Daenerys and her child or her brother. Daenerys observes, with a laughing sob, that the\\nUsurper owes Drogo a lordship for killing Viserys.\\nDaenerys then thinks that the Usurper has woken her dragon and looks over to her dragon eggs. She commands Ser\\nJorah to light the brazier despite the heat and then asks him to leave. She then pushes the eggs under the coals,\\nwondering if she is destroying the eggs. Nothing happens and Daenerys is very disappointed, but wonders even to\\nherself what she was expecting.\\nDrogo returns with the carcass of a \\nhrakkar\\n as the stars come out. After he has told her that he will make her a cloak\\nof its skin, Daenerys tells him what has happened. Drogo becomes very quiet as Ser Jorah tells him that this will not\\nbe the last attempt. For their roles in saving his \\nkhaleesi\\n, Drogo gives Ser Jorah and Jhogo their choice of his horses.\\nDrogo also proclaims a gift for his unborn son, \\nRhaego\\n: the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Drogo then swears to the\\nMother of Mountains that he will take his \\nkhalasar\\n west and ride the wooden horses to Westeros to kill the men in\\nthe iron suits and tear down their stone houses.

She is accompanied by Ser \\nBrynden Tully\\n and Ser \\nWylis\\n and Ser \\nWendel\\n \\nManderly\\n with their\\n1,500 men, including 20 knights and 200 mounted men. Their father, Lord \\nWyman Manderly\\n—who is too fat to sit a\\nhorse—has remained to see to the defenses of \\nWhite Harbor\\n but sent his two stout sons, who would have been the\\nfattest men Catelyn had ever seen if she had not met their father.\\nSer Brynden, upon seeing the fortress, thinks it is a deathtrap. Most of the ancient fortress has long since rotted away\\nleaving only 3 out of 20 towers. Catelyn reassures him that, according to \\nher husband\\n, it is more formidable than it\\nseems. The \\nthree\\n \\nremaining\\n \\ntowers\\n command the only causeway across the impenetrable bogs of the Neck; to\\nassault any one of the towers an enemy must wade through waist-deep muck and \\nlizard-lion\\n-infested moats then\\nclimb the moss-covered towers while exposed to attack from the other two towers. In addition, there are also\\nsupposed to be cold, vengeful ghosts of \\nthe North\\n that hunger for southron blood. Ser Brynden jests that he, as a\\nsouthron, should not linger in this place.\\nCatelyn heads for the \\nGatehouse Tower\\n, understanding the lone \\nStark\\n banner to mean that \\nRobb\\n has made his seat\\nthere. She arrives to find Robb surrounded by his father’s bannermen in a drafty hall. At first, Robb does not notice\\nCatelyn, but his \\nwolf\\n does. After his bannermen fall quiet, her son looks up and is happy to see her. Each of the lords\\npay their respects to her, \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n being the last. He expresses surprise at Catelyn’s presence, so she explains\\nthat she learned Robb had called the banners when she came ashore at White Harbor. She then introduces the\\nManderly brothers and her uncle.\\nWhen Robb asks, Catelyn explains that she has sent Ser \\nRodrik\\n back to \\nWinterfell\\n to act as \\ncastellan\\n and to assist\\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n in military matters. After some of the lords give Catelyn reassurance that Winterfell is safe, Lord\\nRoose Bolton\\n states that it is rumored she holds \\nTyrion Lannister\\n, who would be a good hostage. Catelyn admits she\\nlost the dwarf because the gods saw fit to free him with help from \\nher sister\\n. Speaking of Lysa, Catelyn recalls that\\nbefore leaving the \\nEyrie\\n, she attempted to convince her sister to let her take \\nRobert Arryn\\n as a fosterling, but Lysa’s\\nrage had been frightening.\\nCatelyn then sends the bannermen and Theon away to speak to Robb alone. Once they are gone, Catelyn notes that\\nher son looks older, especially with his new beard. Catelyn, who is afraid for her son, notes to Robb that he is only\\nfifteen and leading a host to war. Robb insists that there was no one else. Catelyn argues that he could have given\\ncommand to any of the bannermen, or even Theon, although he would not have been her choice. Robb responds that\\nnone of them are Starks. Catelyn then reminds Robb that he was fighting with wooden swords less than a year ago.\\nRobb’s eyes flare with anger, but he softens and asks if she is sending him back to Winterfell. Catelyn explains that\\nshe cannot do such a thing; if she did, the bannermen would lose respect for him, which would hurt him when he\\n\\nbecomes Lord of Winterfell one day. Robb’s relief is obvious.\\nRobb asks if Catelyn knows about Lord Eddard\\'s capture and she says she does; \\nRobert\\n\\'s sudden death and Eddard’s\\nfall scared her greatly. Catelyn asks about the girls and Robb tells her that letters addressed to each of them from\\nSansa\\n arrived at Winterfell. Robb returns with a crumpled parchment and hands it to her. She reads it with concern\\ngiving way to disbelief, then to anger, and then to fear. She exclaims that it is \\nCersei’s\\n letter, and that they have\\nSansa hostage and mean to keep her. Robb points out that there is no mention of \\nArya\\n and that he was hoping that\\nCatelyn still held Tyrion to exchange for his sisters.\\nRobb then asks about the knights of \\nthe Vale\\n and is told that Lysa will do nothing; only one knight of the Vale will\\nride to war: the best, Ser Brynden Tully. Robb asks Catelyn what they are going to do with the 18,000 men he does\\nhave. Catelyn can tell that Robb is caught in indecision, which will not do. Knowing he is worried about his father\\nand sisters, Catelyn explains to her son that if he goes to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n to bend the knee he will never be allowed\\nto leave, and if he retreats to Winterfell his lords will lose respect for him. In either case, Cersei can then do as she\\nlikes to her captives without fear. Their only hope is that Robb can defeat the \\nLannisters\\n in the field; Cersei cannot\\nharm her captives because she will need them as hostages if things go against her. However, if Robb loses there is\\nno hope for any of them and they will suffer the fate of the \\nTargaryen children\\n; there is naught but stone at the heart\\nof \\nCasterly Rock\\n. Robb states that that makes it simple: he will not lose.\\nCatelyn then asks about the situation in the \\nRiverlands\\n. Robb informs her that \\nthe war\\n has begun. A fortnight past,\\nSer \\nJaime Lannister\\n \\nsmashed\\n the \\nTully\\n force led by Lords \\nVance\\n and \\nPiper\\n at the \\nGolden Tooth\\n and is now\\nadvancing on \\nRiverrun\\n. Meanwhile, Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n has come up from the south with an even larger army.\\nThis army \\nambushed\\n the party of Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n sent to bring Gregor Clegane to justice, killing \\nRaymun\\nDarry\\n and most of the men from Winterfell. Lord Beric may have escaped, but no one knows for sure. Now Lord\\nTywin is marching north to \\nHarrenhal\\n, burning as he goes.\\nThe news is worse than Catelyn imagined. She asks Robb if he plans to await Lord Tywin’s army at Moat Cailin,\\nbut Robb says that no one thinks that Tywin will be stupid enough to come that far; instead he will take the castles\\nof the river lords one by one. Robb believes that they should march south to meet him. Catelyn questions the idea of\\nleaving their strong position at Moat Cailin, fearing that her son has no chance against seasoned battle commanders\\nlike Tywin and Jaime Lannister. Robb explains that his supplies are running low and that an army the size of his\\ncannot live off this land forever; now that Lord Manderly’s force has arrived, they need to march. Catelyn realizes\\nthe truth in what Robb says, remembering that Robb’s is not a standing army, but a levy of fishermen and farmers\\nthat will not stay cohesive if left idle.\\nDeclaring that marching is all well and good, Catelyn asks Robb where he plans on marching \\nto\\n. Again Robb is\\nuncertain; the Greatjon believes they should take the battle to Lord Tywin, while others think they should join with\\nSer \\nEdmure Tully\\n to defend Riverrun. Catelyn tells her son that, since he appointed himself battle commander, he\\nmust command; he cannot appear indecisive in front of his lords.\\nCatelyn asks Robb again what he intends to do. He declares that both plans have their merits, but he does not think a\\ncommander as experienced as Lord Tywin will be easily surprised and his forces are too strong to defeat easily.\\nRobb decides to have his infantry continue down the \\nKingsroad\\n but to send his horse across the \\nGreen Fork\\n and then\\nsouth to relieve Riverrun. This will put the river between his two forces but also between Tywin and Jaime.\\nHowever, the only available crossing of the Green Fork is at \\nthe Twins\\n, which is controlled by \\nHouse Frey\\n.\\nAlthough a bannerman to \\nHouse Tully\\n, Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n has never been the most loyal; all Catelyn can think of is\\nthat the “Late” Lord Frey failed to arrive at the \\nBattle of the Trident\\n until after the battle was done. She tells Robb\\nthat \\nher father\\n has never trusted Lord Walder and that he should not either.\\nCatelyn, impressed by Robb’s plan, asks who will command each force. Robb informs her of his plan to lead the\\nmounted force to Riverrun himself, while command of his main army of foot soldiers moving south to intercept\\nLord Tywin will be given to the Greatjon. In an attempt to show Robb his error, Catelyn points out that his father\\nconsidered the Greatjon one of his most fearless men, but that his father is not fearless; he is brave, but that is\\ndifferent. Robb reconsiders and decides he needs a man of caution and cold cunning to lead the main force. Robb\\nrealizes that he should put \\nRoose Bolton\\n, whose cold cunning scares even him, in command; hopefully Bolton will\\nscare Lord Tywin as well.\\n\\nRobb states that he wants Catelyn to return to Winterfell. She insists that her father is dying and her brother is\\nsurrounded by foes; her place is with them at Riverrun.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn VII\\n↑\\nDaenerys VI\\n ←\\nCatelyn VIII\\n→ \\nTyrion VII\\n↓\\nCatelyn IX\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 56: Tyrion VII\\nPlace(s): \\ninn at the crossroads\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VI\\n↑\\nCatelyn VIII\\n ←\\nTyrion VII\\n→ \\nSansa V\\n↓\\nTyrion VIII\\nTyrion\\n meets \\nhis father’s\\n army at the \\ninn at the crossroads\\n, escorted by 300 \\nVale mountain clansmen\\n. Tyrion and\\nLord Tywin are discussing their war plans when Tyrion’s clansmen burst in, but Tywin handles them coolly. When\\nnews arrives that \\nRobb Stark\\n’s host is advancing, Tywin offers rich rewards to the clansmen if they fight for him.\\nSynopsis\\nChella\\n of the \\nBlack Ears\\n is the one who locates \\nLord Tywin\\n’s army, which she deduces to be 20,000 men. \\nTyrion\\nhas gathered a force of over 300 \\nmountain clansmen\\n and \\nGunthor son of Gurn\\n is collecting more. He wonders what\\nhis father will make of his little army, since he is not sure what to make of them himself.\\nTyrion wants to meet his father without the clansmen, but \\nUlf son of Umar\\n expresses distrust and \\nShagga\\n insists that\\nhe will go with the “boyman,” and if he lies Tyrion will lose his manhood. Tyrion is forced to quickly give in to the\\ndemands of his captor-followers (he’s still not sure which they are) and selects representatives from each clan to\\naccompany him. As a parting jibe, he asks the remaining clansmen to try not to kill each other while he is gone.\\nTyrion dislikes having to work with the clans because they think everyone’s voice should be heard in council, which\\ncauses them to argue endlessly.\\nWhen they come to the first strongpoint, which Tyrion approaches alone, the captain recognizes Tyrion and gives\\nthem an escort. They travel past burned land and buildings. There are many carrion birds, although there are no\\nbodies. When they arrive at the guarded camp containing hundreds of campfires, they are met by a party led by Ser\\nFlement Brax\\n, who is surprised to see Tyrion. He tells Tyrion that his father has taken the \\ninn at the crossroads\\n as his\\nheadquarters, which Tyrion finds a fitting full-circle to his \\nunpleasant abduction\\n.\\nAs they pass the many banners, Tyrion guesses that Chella’s count cannnot be far wrong. He also notes that his\\nclansmen are awed, which pleases him; the more impressed they are by the power of \\nHouse Lannister\\n the easier they\\nwill be to control. When they arrive at the inn, Tyrion is pleased to see the body of the innkeepter \\nMasha Heddle\\nrotting in a gibbet. When the stableboys emerge hesitantly to take their horses, Shagga is suspicious but Tyrion is\\nable to convince him. House guards at the door direct Tyrion to his father in the common room.\\nLord Tywin Lannister is sharing ale with his brother, Ser \\nKevan Lannister\\n. Kevan sees Tyrion first and expresses\\nsurprise, but Tywin only remarks that the rumors of his demise were unfounded. Tyrion tells his father that he is\\nsorry to disappoint him, feeling uncomfortable with his deformities under his father’s gaze. He quickly covers his\\ndiscomfort with a quip that he is thankful they started a war for his sake. His father takes the opportunity to chastise\\nTyrion for going meekly with \\na woman\\n; his brother \\nJaime\\n would not have gone without a fight. Tyrion replies that\\nJaime is also taller.\\nLord Tywin then explains that Lannister honor demanded they go to war after Tyrion was captured. Tyrion asks\\nthem how that \\nwar\\n is going. His father explains that Jaime has been covering himself in glory, \\nsmashing\\n the forces\\nof Lords \\nPiper\\n and \\nVance\\n at the \\nGolden Tooth\\n and pushing on to \\ndefeat\\n the main \\nTully\\n forces outside \\nRiverrun\\n and\\ncapture \\nEdmure Tully\\n. Lord \\nBlackwood\\n has fallen back to hold Riverrun against Jaime, but the other \\nriver lords\\nhave dispersed to their own lands. Many of these lords have now fallen one by one to Lord Tywin’s army, leaving\\nonly the \\nFreys\\n and \\nMallisters\\n to oppose them. Lord Tywin in not concerned; he knows that \\nWalder Frey\\n will not\\n\\nbestir himself until the winner is clear and \\nJason Mallister\\n lacks the strength to stand alone. The only real threat is\\nthat the \\nStarks\\n or \\nArryns\\n will interfere.\\nTyrion tells them they need not worry about the Arryns, but the Starks are another matter. He is informed of \\nEddard\\nStark\\n’s arrest and that \\nRobb Stark\\n has called the Stark banners. Tywin remains unperturbed, declaring that Robb is\\nonly a child. When Tyrion questions how \\nCersei\\n has convinced King \\nRobert\\n to imprison his dear friend Ned, he\\nlearns that the king is dead and \\nJoffrey\\n now reigns. Tyrion immediately understands that his sister is the true ruler\\nand knows that things will be very different.\\nTyrion is then offered a command in the army: he is to handle \\nMarq Piper\\n and \\nKaryl Vance\\n, who have been raiding\\nJaime’s supply trains across the \\nRed Fork\\n, and \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n, who has been harassing Tywin’s forging parties.\\nTyrion is not impressed with this command of perhaps 20 men, so he reveals to his father he has a promise to keep:\\nweapons and armor for 3,000 clansmen and wagons to carry them.\\nThen the door opens with a crash as the Captain of the Guard flies across the room. Shagga stamps in, followed by\\nthe other clansmen. Lord Tywin coolly asks who they are and Tyrion explains that they followed him and he wants\\nto keep them. The clansmen insist that free men have the right to sit on war councils. Once Tyrion has introduced\\nthe clansmen, he introduces his father, complete with all his titles. Lord Tywin claims that even in the \\nwesterlands\\nthey have heard of the prowess of the mountain clans, and asks what brings them here. The reply is horses, silk, and\\nsteel.\\nIt is then that news arrives that Robb Stark’s host is coming down the \\nkingsroad\\n. Lord Tywin is pleased that he will\\nbe given such an easy chance to defeat House Stark so he can turn his attention towards \\nStannis Baratheon\\n. He gives\\norders that Ser \\nAddam Marbrand\\n fall back to draw the northerners further south, harassing them along the way.\\nAfter ordering the army assembled, Tywin compliments the clansmen’s fearless reputation and promises that if they\\nfight for him he will provide them with all that Tyrion promised them and more. The clansmen insist that they are\\nbeing promised what is already owed. Tywin quickly covers by claiming that his words were a courtesy and that his\\nboldest knights fear to face the northerners. \\nTimett\\n takes the bait and declares that the \\nBurned Men\\n fear nothing.\\nWith the Burned Men agreeing, all the other clans agree, but only if Tyrion accompanies them into battle until the\\npromises he made them are honored.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VI\\n↑\\nCatelyn VIII\\n ←\\nTyrion VII\\n→ \\nSansa V\\n↓\\nTyrion VIII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 57: Sansa V\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa IV\\n↑\\nTyrion VII\\n ←\\nSansa V\\n→ \\nEddard XV\\n↓\\nSansa VI\\nSansa\\n attends \\nJoffrey\\n’s first court session as king.

When he is dismissed from the \\nKingsguard\\n, Ser\\nBarristan Selmy\\n storms out. In his place, \\nthe Hound\\n is appointed to the Kingsguard. Finally, Sansa comes forward to\\nask for leniency for \\nher father\\n, and it is agree that mercy will be granted if he confesses and names Joffrey the true\\nking.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa\\n attends King \\nJoffrey\\n’s first court session. As a reward for being good and promising not to leave the \\nRed\\nKeep\\n, Sansa has been granted freedom of the castle by Queen \\nCersei\\n. However, even Sansa realizes that it is an\\nempty honor since she cannot get past the guards in any case, and has nowhere to go if she did. In addition, the\\nqueen has attached an “honor guard” to accompany Sansa everywhere.\\nThe throne room has been stripped of all the hunting tapestries that King \\nRobert\\n loved so well. Sansa also notes that\\nthere are no smallfolk and only perhaps twenty of the hundred lords accustomed to wait on King Robert. Sansa\\nwonders where the others have all gone. As she passes among them, many of the men pretend not to know her and\\nnone will meet her eyes.\\nJoffrey and Cersei are announced by a herald and enter escorted by members of the \\nKingsguard\\n. Once he is seated\\non the \\nIron Throne\\n, Joffrey declares that it is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and reward the faithful and asks\\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n to read his royal decrees. The list of those that must present themselves to swear fealty goes\\non for a long time. Finally, near the end, the names of Sansa’s own \\nfamily\\n are called, even down to \\nArya\\n and\\nRickon\\n. The naming of Arya suggests to Sansa that her sister must have escaped and be safe in \\nWinterfell\\n.\\nIt is then announced that the king’s grandfather, Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n is to take up the office of \\nHand of the King\\n in\\nplace of the traitor \\nEddard Stark\\n. It is also decreed that Cersei Lannister, as Queen Regent, be seated on the \\nsmall\\ncouncil\\n in place of \\nStannis Baratheon\\n and that \\nJanos Slynt\\n, Commander of the \\nCity Watch of King\\'s Landing\\n, be\\nraised to the rank of Lord and granted the ancient seat of \\nHarrenhal\\n as well as a seat on the small council. Janos\\nSlynt then enters the hall, displaying his new \\nlordly sigil\\n, to take his seat at the council table. The elevation of Slynt,\\na butcher’s son, to the lordship of Harrenhal visibly angers many of the knights and lords present. Finally, Pycelle\\nreads a decree that, in these times of turmoil, the council considers the safety of King Joffrey to be of paramount\\nimportance.\\nQueen Cersei stands and calls forth Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n. She proceeds to thank the old knight for his many years of\\nservice in the Kingsguard, but declares that the time has come for him to set aside his burden. Ser Barristan is\\nconfused until the new-made Lord Slynt explains bluntly that he is being relieved as \\nLord Commander of the\\nKingsguard\\n. Ser Barristan is plainly stunned and protests that only death may relieve a Kingsguard of his sacred\\ntrust. Cersei asks whose death: his or his king’s. Joffrey goes even further, accusing Ser Barristan of letting his\\nfather die and declaring him too old to protect anyone.\\nSer Barristan reminds them that he has long ago forsaken his \\nancestral lands\\n and \\nkeep\\n and a wife-to-be in order to\\nserve in the Kingsguard. He goes on to recount his history as a member of the Kingsguard, protecting and serving\\n\\nthree kings. \\nLittlefinger\\n notes that all three of these kings are dead. Then Cersei reiterates that Ser Barristan’s time is\\ndone because Joffrey needs young and strong men around him, and that Ser \\nJaime Lannister\\n will succeed him as\\nLord Commander. Ser Barristan is outraged that a man who killed the king he swore to protect should be made the\\nLord Commander.\\nVarys\\n attempts to calm the situation, insisting that they are not ungrateful to Ser Barristan and that Lord Tywin\\nLannister has agreed to grant Ser Barristan a tract of land in the \\nWesterlands\\n with men and gold sufficient to build a\\nstout keep and servants to see to his every need. Ser Barristan venomously describes such a gift as a hall to die in\\nand men to bury him. He removes his white cloak and armor and drops them on the floor, declaring that he will die a\\nknight. Littlefinger quips “A naked knight, it would seem,” which raises laughs from the entire hall, even the\\nremaining members of the Kingsguard.\\nThe laughter ends abruptly when Ser Barristan draws his sword, but the old knight insists they should have no fear,\\neven though he could still cut down the remaining five Kingsguard with ease. He adds in disgust that any man who\\nwould serve under the Kingslayer does not deserve the white cloak. Then he throws his sword at the foot of the Iron\\nThrone, declaring to Joffrey, “Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others.” Before he leaves, the old knight\\nsuggests that perhaps \\nStannis\\n will depose Joffrey and sit upon the throne. The knight’s footsteps echo through the\\nhall as he takes the long way out.\\nJoffrey is incensed at Ser Barristan’s talk of Stannis and at being called a boy. He orders Ser Barristan seized and\\nquestioned. Finally, Janos Slynt announces that his gold cloaks will see to it. It is then announced that \\nSandor\\nClegane\\n will fill the vacancy created by the departure of Ser Barristan. Joffrey asks the Hound what he thinks, and\\nClegane declares that he has no lands or wife to forsake, but that he will not take a knight’s vows. Ser \\nBoros Blount\\nof the Kingsguard protests that the members of the Kingsguard have always been anointed knights, but is quickly\\nrebuffed.\\nThe time has finally come for Sansa when she hears the herald ask for any further business. She nervously comes\\nforward, thinking that she must be as strong as her \\nlady mother\\n. She calls out and Joffrey, seeing her, tells her to\\ncome forward, which emboldens her. She begs mercy for her father. Queen Cersei expresses displeasure, but Varys\\nonly claims that she is a child who does not understand what she says. Joffrey tells the others to let her speak.\\nThe small council questions her about her father’s treason, and Sansa knows better than to deny it. Instead she tells\\nthem that others must have lied to her father, and that he only claimed Joffrey was not the king because of the pain\\nfrom his broken leg and the effects of the \\nmilk of the poppy\\n. Joffrey calls for his mother, who states that if Lord\\nEddard confesses his crime, then they will know he has repented. Sansa prays that her Joffrey be as kind and noble\\nas she believes he is. Joffrey agrees that if Eddard admits his guilt and swears fealty he will be granted mercy.

When Eddard states that his life is not worth forsaking his\\nhonor, Varys tells him that Cersei has \\nSansa\\n, whose life is also at stake.\\nSynopsis\\nNed\\n’s cell contains nothing but straw that stinks of urine. There are no windows, so the darkness is absolute. Ned\\nthinks back to \\nRobert\\n’s words, “The king eats and the \\nHand\\n takes the shit,” and thinks, “The king dies, and the Hand\\nis buried.” The cell is deeper under the \\nRed Keep\\n than Ned dares imagine. He remembers the story of \\nMaegor the\\nCruel\\n murdering the masons to keep the castle’s secrets. He also remembers \\nCersei\\n’s words, “When you play the\\ngame of thrones, you win or you die,” and he knows that he has played and lost. He wants to weep, but he is still a\\nStark\\n of \\nWinterfell\\n and his grief and rage freeze inside him.\\nAs his injured leg throbs, Ned damns them all, but can only blame himself; he was a fool. To keep himself sane, he\\nthinks and plans aloud. \\nStannis\\n and \\nRenly\\n \\nBaratheon\\n are likely gathering armies at \\nDragonstone\\n and \\nStorm\\'s End\\n.\\nCatelyn\\n will raise \\nthe North\\n and the armies of \\nRiver\\n and \\nVale\\n will join her.\\nAs time drags on, Ned finds himself thinking more and more of Robert Baratheon as he was in the flower of his\\nyouth. In the darkness of his cell he can hear Robert ask him, “Gods, how are we come to this? You here, and me\\nkilled by a pig.” Ned broods on how he failed Robert by hiding the truth and letting them kill him. When Ned is half\\nasleep, a jailer arrives with water, which he drinks eagerly. He asks the jailer for news but is ignored.\\nAs his solitude grows, Ned vividly remembers when he was eighteen at the \\nTourney at Harrenhal\\n. He remembers\\nBrandon\\n’s laughter, Robert’s valor in the melee, \\nJaime Lannister\\n joining the \\nKingsguard\\n, and \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\ndefeating Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n in the final joust. Then Ned remembers the moment when all the smiles died, as\\nRhaegar rode past \\nhis own wife\\n to lay the queen of beauty’s laurel in \\nLyanna\\n’s lap. It was a crown of winter roses,\\nwhich Lyanna loved the scent of. In his delirium, Eddard grasps the laurel, but there are thorns underneath and blood\\ntrickles down his fingers. Then he remembers his promise to Lyanna again, and weeps that he is going mad.\\nThe jailer continues to come with a jug of water each day, but no food, and eventually Ned no longer asks questions.\\nHe is sure that Cersei will not kill him as long as Catelyn holds \\nthe Imp\\n.\\nA new jailer arrives with wine instead of water. The voice that tells him to drink is familiar; it is \\nVarys\\n in a very\\neffective \\ndisguise\\n. Varys tells him that \\nArya\\n escaped (which is for the best since Joffrey has no love for her), and\\nthat \\nSansa\\n is still betrothed to Joffrey and kept close by the queen. Sansa \\npleaded\\n for his life in court a few days\\nprevious. Ned reminds Varys that Cersei will not kill him because Catelyn holds her brother. Varys replies that\\nTyrion is the wrong brother. Besides, Catelyn has let Tyrion escape and he is probably now dead in the \\nMountains\\nof the Moon\\n.\\nNed accuses Varys of standing by while his guards were slaughtered; Varys makes no apologies since he was\\nunarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister soldiers. Varys continues by telling Ned that he plays his part: a\\ncourageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight. Ned asks if Varys will free him, but Varys points out\\nthat he would be the prime suspect. When asked if he will deliver a message, Varys admits that he will read it and\\nthen decide if it serves his purpose first. When asked his purpose, Varys states that it is peace.\\n\\nVarys tells Ned that he struggled to keep Robert alive and protected him from his enemies for fifteen years, but\\ncould not protect him from his friends. Then Varys asks what madness led Ned to tell the queen he knew the truth of\\nJoffrey’s birth. Ned says it was the madness of mercy; he had hoped to save the children’s lives. Varys remarks that\\nhe often forgets that Ned is one of the few honest men in the world, but when he sees the reward Ned has earned he\\nunderstands why.\\nNed then asks if Varys questioned \\nLancel Lannister\\n about the wine. Varys explains that Cersei gave Lancel the\\nwineskins and told him it was the king’s favorite vintage. In any case, if it had not been the boar, it would have been\\nsome other form of accident because Cersei needed to be rid of Robert to deal with his brothers: Stannis the iron\\ngauntlet and Renly the silk glove. Varys then points out that Ned should have taken \\nLittlefinger’s\\n advice and\\nsupported Joffrey. Ned is shocked that Varys knows about the offer.\\nVarys then informs Ned that the queen will visit him the next day. She is frightened of him, but fears other enemies\\nmore: \\nJaime Lannister\\n fights the \\nriver lords\\n, \\nLysa Arryn\\n is no friend, \\nthe Martells\\n lust for vengeance for the\\nmurdered \\nElia\\n and her babes, and \\nRobb Stark\\n marches down \\nthe Neck\\n. Robb may only be a boy, but he is a boy with\\nan army. Then there is Stannis who has a true claim to the throne, is a skilled military tactician, and is utterly\\nwithout mercy. Most of all, Cersei fears that while \\nher father\\n battles the Starks and their allies, Stannis will descend\\non King\\'s Landing, kill her and her children, and proclaim himself king.\\nHowever, Varys explains, Cersei knows “a tame wolf is more use than a dead one,” but telling her Stannis is the true\\nheir will only lose Ned his head. Ned asks if he is expected to serve the woman who killed his king and crippled his\\nson. Varys replies that he expects Ned to serve the realm: admit his treason, command Robb to lay down his sword,\\ndenounce Stannis and Renly, and carry Cersei’s secret to the grave. Cersei knows Ned is a man of honor and will let\\nhim join his \\nbrother\\n and his \\nbastard son\\n in the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n. The thought of Jon brings shame and deep sorrow to\\nNed.\\nNed accuses Varys of being Littlefinger’s man, but Varys denies it, saying Littlefinger is the second most devious\\nman in the kingdom. Varys only feeds him choice whispers so that Littlefinger thinks he is his, just like the queen.\\nNed agrees that sounds just like Varys and asks whom the eunuch truly serves. Varys replies that he serves the\\nrealm, and the realm needs peace.\\nWhen Varys asks what his answer will be, Ned says his life is not as precious as his honor. Varys points out that\\nneither he nor the queen has forgotten about Sansa. Caught off-guard by this, Ned begs Varys to leave Sansa out of\\nhis schemes, insisting his daughter is just a child. Varys notes that \\nRhaenys Targaryen\\n was also a child when the\\nLannisters broke down her door. As he leaves he tells Ned that the next visitor can bring him either food and \\nmilk of\\nthe poppy\\n or Sansa’s head. The choice, Varys says, is up to Ned.\\nNavigation:\\nEddard XIV\\n↑\\nSansa V\\n ←\\nEddard XV\\n→ \\nCatelyn IX\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 59: Catelyn IX\\nPlace(s): \\nThe Twins\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn VIII\\n↑\\nEddard XV\\n ←\\nCatelyn IX\\n→ \\nJon VIII\\n↓\\nCatelyn X\\nRobb\\n’s host arrives at \\nthe Twins\\n, where \\nCatelyn\\n negotiates their crossing of the \\nGreen Fork\\n with Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nCatelyn’s\\n apprehensions grow as \\nRobb\\n’s host moves south towards \\nthe Twins\\n.

A dozen Lannister scouts have been\\nkilled, and the Lannister force under Ser \\nAddam Marbrand\\n is retreating south, burning as they go. Theon declares\\nthere is no way the Lannisters will know they have split their forces, but Catelyn cautions that Walder Frey may tell\\nthem. She encourages them to place archers to kill any ravens leaving the Twins, but Theon says it has already been\\ndone.\\nAs she wonders what the Freys have been doing, Catelyn is told that there has been some fighting between the Freys\\nand Marbrand’s men, but most of the Frey strength is at the Twins. This gives hope to Robb that Lord Frey will\\nhonor his vows, but Catelyn points out that it is one thing to protect one’s land and another to engage in open battle.\\nThe only way across the \\nGreen Fork\\n north of the \\nRuby Ford\\n is the bridge at the Twins, especially with the river\\nrunning high and no wood for rafts. Theon suggests that they can storm the Twin if they must (they have five times\\nLord Frey’s numbers), but Catelyn responds that it would not be easy. There is also no time; while they laid siege to\\nthe Twins, Lord Tywin would bring up his host and attack from the rear. Catelyn can see that Robb is unsure as he\\nasks her what his father would do. Catelyn insists that he would find a way across no matter what it takes.\\nSer Brynden arrives with the dire news that Edmure’s host has been \\ndefeated\\n under the walls of Riverrun and\\nscattered. Edmure himself has been wounded and captured, but some survivors have taken refuge inside Riverrun.\\nOther news is that Lord Frey has withdrawn his strength inside his twin castles. Robb is frustrated, and states that he\\nwill pull the walls down around Lord Frey. Catelyn rebukes him, saying he sounds like a sulky boy and that\\nsometimes words are needed. She explains that the Freys have never failed to extract their toll in the 600 years that\\nthey have controlled the crossing. What this toll will be, they have yet to learn but if Robb is unwilling to pay the\\ntoll, the only option Catelyn can see is to retreat to \\nMoat Cailin\\n to meet Lord Tywin in battle. She rides away, not\\nwanting to make it seem that she was usurping Robb’s authority and asks herself if her husband has taught their son\\nwisdom, or how to kneel.\\n\\nIt is near midday when they arrive at the Twins, two ugly stout castles on either side of the Green Fork with a wide\\nbridge between them. The Freys have gotten rich off the tolls from this bridge. Upon seeing the castles, the northern\\nlords can see it would be very nearly impossible to take by storm. A dozen knights led by Ser \\nStevron Frey\\n, heir to\\nLord Walder, come forward from the sally port. Ser Stevron asks who leads and Robb rides forward to be told that\\nLord Walder invites him to share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain his purpose. None of Robb’s\\nlords like this, fearing that Robb could easily be captured and sold to the Lannisters. Catelyn can tell that Stevron is\\nnot pleased by the accusations, and attempts to save the negotiations by volunteering to go herself. There are\\nobjections, but she tells them that Lord Walder is her father’s bannerman and will not harm her, hoping it is true. It\\nis agreed and Stevron’s brother, Ser \\nPerwyn Frey\\n, remains as a hostage to her fair treatment.\\nThe frail 90-year-old Lord Walder Frey meets Catelyn in the great hall with all but one (the hostage, Perwyn) of his\\n21 sons, 36 grandsons, and countless other descendants. Walder is impolite and direct; even some of his sons point\\nout his impoliteness, but he does not respond well to their criticism. Catelyn knows that she has to be careful with\\nher words and explains that she is there to ask him to open his gates so they can proceed to Riverrun where she\\nwould have expected to find him. Lord Walder insists that he was still gathering his strength when her brother lost\\nthe battle. Catelyn doubts Lord Walder’s version of events, but does not press the issue. She asks that they talk\\nprivately, and Lord Walder commands all the others to leave.\\nOnce they are alone, Lord Walder declares that his descendants are all waiting for him to die, then he asks why he\\nshould let Robb’s host cross. When Catelyn makes a very subtle threat about the size of Robb’s army, Lord Walder\\nretorts that her son’s army will be 20,000 fresh corpses when the Lannisters arrive. When Catelyn reminds Lord\\nWalder of his vows to \\nHouse Tully\\n, the old man counters that he also swore allegiance to the king, making her and\\nher son nothing but rebels. Lord Walder then takes his turn at threatening: if he had the sense the gods gave a fish he\\nwould deny them the crossing and let the Lannisters have them. However, the old man quickly reveals that he does\\nnot care for the Lannisters either, with their gold, their lions, and their arrogant pride. Lord Walder goes on to say\\nthat if the Lannisters want his help they must \\nask\\n. Catelyn humbly stresses that \\nshe\\n is asking, as are her father, her\\nbrother, her sons, and her husband with her voice.\\nWalder complains about her father insulting him by not being present for his last few weddings; an insult despite\\nLord Hoster’s failing health. The old man complains about Lord Hoster not marrying Edmure to one of his\\ndaughters, then he complains about how his heirs were defeated in a tourney he attended. He also complains that \\nJon\\nArryn\\n would not foster two of his grandsons, or let him foster \\nRobert Arryn\\n. When Lord Arryn announced that his\\nson was going to be fostered with Lord \\nStannis\\n, \\nLysa\\n stormed off and all the Jon could do was apologize. Catelyn\\nasks if it was not Lord Tywin that Robert Arryn was to be fostered with, but Lord Walder insists that he knows the\\ndifference between Stannis and Tywin. Then Lord Walder asks again why he should allow them to cross and the\\nhaggling begins.\\nCatelyn returns to Robb followed by Ser \\nJared Frey\\n, Ser \\nHosteen Frey\\n, Ser \\nDanwell Frey\\n, Walder’s bastard \\nRonel\\nRivers\\n, and a long column of pikemen. She tells Robb that he has been granted the crossing and that all but 400 of\\nLord Frey’s forces will join his army. In exchange, two of Lord Walder’s grandsons will be fostered by the Starks at\\nWinterfell\\n, \\nOlyvar Frey\\n will become Robb’s squire, Arya will marry Walder’s youngest son \\nElmar\\n, and Robb\\nhimself will marry his choice of Lord Walder’s daughters when the fighting is done. Robb, realizing he has no\\nchoice if he wants to cross, consents. Catelyn suggests that he should leave 400 archers and swordsmen at the Twins\\nto ensure Lord Walder keeps faith under a reliable man. Robb suggests Ser \\nHelman Tallhart\\n and Catelyn agrees.\\nRobb and his cavalry cross that evening as Lord Walder Frey watches from a litter while \\nRoose Bolton\\n and the\\ninfantry stay on the east bank to march south and confront Lord Tywin.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn VIII\\n↑\\nEddard XV\\n ←\\nCatelyn IX\\n→ \\nJon VIII\\n↓\\nCatelyn X\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 60: Jon VIII\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon VII\\n↑\\nCatelyn IX\\n ←\\nJon VIII\\n→ \\nDaenerys VII\\n↓\\nJon IX\\nJon\\n is presented with the \\nValyrian steel\\n sword \\nLongclaw\\n by \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n. Jon attempts to refuse, but\\nthe commander insists. Later, Jon gets a message that Maester \\nAemon\\n wants to see him. The maester knows that Jon\\nis divided between his duty and his family loyalties and explains that he sympathizes. When Jon rejects his empathy,\\nthe old man reveals that he is Aemon Targaryen, son of King \\nMaekar I\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nJon\\n lies that he is well when asked by \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n. His right hand is swathed in bandages halfway to\\nthe elbow and pains him constantly. When he threw the burning curtains onto the \\nwight\\n of \\nOthor\\n, Jon burned his\\nhand more seriously than he realized, but Maester \\nAemon\\n has assured him that there will be no permanent damage\\naside from the scars. Jon is glad, however, that only \\nGhost\\n can see him writhe and weep from the pain at night. Yet,\\nwhen he does manage to sleep, Jon has nightmares of battling a wight with \\nhis father\\n’s face that are far worse.\\nJon notices that the Lord Commander looks old and grumpy without his beard, which has been shaved after it was\\nbadly singed in the fire. Mormont explains to Jon that the rangers’ search has found no sign of \\nhis uncle\\n or more\\nwights; two of those were bad enough. Still both Mormont and Maester Aemon are sure there will be more because\\nthe cold winds are rising.\\nJon states there was a bird last night, saying he hoped for news of his father. Mormont assures Jon that he would\\nhave told him if there was. This message brought word that Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n has been cast out of the \\nKingsguard\\nand is now wanted for treason, having killed two \\ngold cloaks\\n sent to arrest him. Mormont’s distaste is plain for men\\nwho would send gold cloaks to arrest a knight as renowned of Ser Barristan the Bold. The Lord Commander goes on\\nto lament that they have \\nwhite shadows\\n in the woods, \\nundead\\n stalking the halls, and a \\nboy\\n on the \\nIron Throne\\n.\\nMormont notes that Grand Maester \\nPycelle\\n did not include any news about Jon’s sisters; they only tell the Night\\'s\\nWatch what they want them to know. Jon thinks that \\nhe\\n is only told what Mormont want \\nhim\\n to know; he has heard\\nnothing of his brother \\nRobb Stark\\n in the south.\\nMormont asks when Maester Aemon believes Jon will be able to resume using his hand. Jon says soon and the Lord\\nCommander brings out a sword, declaring that Jon is ready for it. Jon is puzzled but is told to take the sword. He\\nrecognizes it as a \\nbastard sword\\n of \\nValyrian steel\\n. Mormont explains that the sword is named \\nLongclaw\\n and has\\nbelonged to \\nHouse Mormont\\n for five centuries. After it was burned in the fire in his tower, Mormont has had the\\npommel remade into the likeness of a white wolf\\'s head with red garnets for eyes.\\nWhen he was young, Jon dreamed of doing great deeds and being granted \\nIce\\n in reward for saving his father’s life,\\nbut he knew it was a folly. Now the memory that he might wish to steal his brother’s birthright shames him. Jon\\ndoes not feel that he deserves Longclaw either and attempts to decline, but Mormont insists he has earned it with his\\nquick thinking to use fire to destroy the wight. Jon accepts, but reminds himself that Mormont is not his father and\\nhe still dreams of Ice.\\nMormont tells Jon that he will now have to practice his two-handed strokes as well, suggesting that Ser \\nEndrew\\nTarth\\n from the \\nShadow Tower\\n, who will assume the duties of master-at-arms, can help him. Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\n has\\n\\nbeen sent to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n with the hand of \\nJafer Flowers\\n to attempt to get the boy king’s attention. Mormont\\nexplains that a message from an anointed high-born knight should get more attention than from an old crow. It also\\nputs a thousand leagues between Jon and Ser Alliser.\\nMormont insists, however, that none of this means that he approves of Jon’s actions: it takes a man to wield\\nLongclaw and he expects Jon to act the part. Jon agrees, thinking again that it is not the blade he would have chosen,\\nbut a fine one. He is also glad to be free from Ser Alliser. Then Mormont sends Jon to fetch his supper. As he leaves,\\nJon sees the guards smiling; one man comments on the sword’s quality and another tells Jon he earned it. Jon is\\nangry but cannot say why.\\nOutside, Jon’s friends are waiting for him, wanting to see the sword. Pyp jokes that Jon is probably the only man in\\nthe entire history of the Night’s Watch to be rewarded for burning down the Lord Commander\\'s Tower. Even Jon\\nhas to smile; no one blames him for setting the fire that destroyed the wight, even if it did gut the top two floors of\\nthe tower. The other wight was hacked to pieces, but not before killing Ser \\nJaremy Rykker\\n and four other men. The\\nthought of the wights sours Jon’s mood and he quickly leaves his friends to get the Lord Commander’s supper. Jon\\nis deeply affected by facing the wight, but does not blame his friends for not understanding. They cannot\\nunderstand; they did not see the pale glow of the blue eyes or feel the cold black hands. They also do not know of\\nthe fighting in the \\nriverlands\\n.\\nGhost is lying beside the door to his room. Jon thinks back to when he found the \\ndirewolf\\n hidden in the snow. He\\nshows Ghost the pommel of the swords, stating it is him. Then \\nSam\\n arrives. He does not want to see the blade,\\nstating he has seen his father’s Valyrian steel \\nblade\\n and it was so sharp he feared he might hurt one of his sisters.\\nSam then announces that Maester Aemon wants to see Jon. Jon is puzzled since it is not time for his bandages to be\\nchanged, but then accuses Sam of telling the maester that he knows about the riverlands. Sam insists that he thinks\\nthe maester knew anyway. Jon tells Sam that he will find the maester himself.\\nClydas\\n is helping Maester Aemon in the rookery when Jon arrives. The maester dismisses Clydas and asks Jon to\\nassist him with feeding the ravens. As they work, Aemon explains that although other birds can be trained to fly\\nmessages the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n has always preferred ravens. The old man goes on to explain that the sworn brothers do\\nnot wed because love is the bane of honor and duty, which the Night’s Watch cannot afford; they must be totally\\ncommitted to defending the realm from the darkness to the north.\\nWhen Jon fails to understand, the maester explains that in every man’s life there comes a day when he must choose\\nbetween his duty and his family, and only one man in ten thousand is strong enough to choose duty. Jon questions if\\nthe maester believes this is his day. Maester Aemon only replies that he knows the choice is always hard. Jon insists\\nthat the old man does not know what it feels like to be in his situation.\\nMaester Aemon sighs and sadly tells Jon that his vows have been tested three times: once as a boy, once in his\\nprime, and once as an old man. The old maester elaborates that the last test was just as hard as the others, regardless\\nthat he was blind, frail, and helpless. He recalls how it grieved him to sit forgotten as his ravens brought news from\\nthe south of the ruin of his House and the death of his \\nbrother’s grandson\\n, and \\nhis\\n son\\n, and even the \\nlittle\\n \\nchildren\\n.\\nJon asks who Maester Aemon is, almost in dread. The old man insists that he is only a maester of the \\nCitadel\\n bound\\nto \\nCastle Black\\n and the Night’s Watch, but that his father was \\nMaekar\\n, the First of His Name, and that his brother\\nAegon\\n ruled after their father in his stead. Jon is astounded. Aemon declares that he \\ndoes\\n know how Jon feels, and\\nso he will not tell Jon to stay or go. Jon must make his own choice, and live with it for the rest of his days as Aemon\\nhas.\\nNavigation:\\nJon VII\\n↑\\nCatelyn IX\\n ←\\nJon VIII\\n→ \\nDaenerys VII\\n↓\\nJon IX\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 61: Daenerys VII\\nPlace(s): \\nA \\nLhazareen\\n town in the \\nDothraki Sea\\n.\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys VI\\n↑\\nJon VIII\\n ←\\nDaenerys VII\\n→ \\nTyrion VIII\\n↓\\nDaenerys VIII\\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n has defeated another \\nkhalasar\\n, capturing a town and many captives. \\nDaenerys\\n intervenes when she sees\\nDothraki\\n warriors raping the women. When she finds Drogo, Daenerys is concerned about her husband’s wounds\\nand calls for the healers. \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n, one of the women she has rescued, speaks up that she is a healer, and\\nDrogo agrees to let her tend to his wounds in her temple.\\nSynopsis\\nDaenerys\\n moves through the trampled fields filled with the dead and wounded around the burning town of the Lamb\\nMen, or \\nLhazareen\\n. \\nKhal\\n \\nOgo\\n’s \\nkhalasar\\n was attacking the town when Khal \\nDrogo\\n arrived. Daenerys remembers\\nthat Khal Ogo was among those who shared the high bench at the \\nfeast\\n when \\nViserys\\n was crowned. However, this is\\nnot \\nVaes Dothrak\\n. Daenerys suspects some of the villagers probably mistook them for deliverance, but once Khal\\nOgo was defeated Drogo’s \\nkhalasar\\n plundered the town just as badly.\\nNow the captives from both the village and Ogo’s \\nkhalasar\\n are being collected for slaves. To an outsider the\\nLhazareen look similar to the Dothraki, but now Daenerys can plainly see the differences. In addition, the Dothraki\\ncaptives do not seem to fear slavery, while the villagers stumble about in fear and sorrow.\\nSer \\nJorah Mormont\\n meets Daenerys at the entrance to the village. The knight brings news that Drogo has killed Khal\\nOgo and \\nhis son\\n, taking only minor wounds. He also informs her that most of the rival \\nkhalasar\\n has fled, but there\\ncould still be as many as 10,000 captives. Ser Jorah says he has suggested they drive the slaves south to \\nMeereen\\nwhere they will fetch a better price; more than enough gold to hire the ships they need to reach the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n.\\nAs she watches the carnage around her, Daenerys can only think about the price of the \\nIron Throne\\n.\\nThe scenes of rape disturb Daenerys the most. She orders Ser Jorah and her \\nbodyguards\\n \\nJhogo\\n and \\nQuaro\\n to stop the\\nrape of a \\nwailing girl\\n. Ser Jorah tries to explain that this is not wise since she is depriving the riders of their reward\\nfor shedding blood for their \\nkhal\\n. Jhogo and Quaro point out that the Dothraki believe the girl should feel honored\\nand even Daenerys’ handmaid \\nIrri\\n agrees. Daenerys is not dissuaded and commands Ser Jorah and the others to stop\\nthe rape. Ser Jorah declares that she truly is \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n’s sister and obeys.\\nStopping the rape requires the death of two of the rapers. When asked what to do with the raped girl, Daenerys\\ncommands \\nDoreah\\n to tend to her hurts, mainly because the blonde-haired \\nLysene\\n girl does not look Dothraki.\\nDaenerys then rides on into the settlement and begins to rescue all of the other rape victims she sees. Ser Jorah tries\\nto explain that she cannot save them all, but Daenerys refuses to believe him.\\nDaenerys finds Drogo with an arrow through his arm and an \\narakh\\n cut that has taken off one of his nipples. Drogo\\ninsists that they are only scratches and boasts that he personally slew not only Khal Ogo, but also his son \\nFogo\\n, who\\nwas \\nkhal\\n after Ogo. Daenerys praises her husband.\\nThen a warrior named \\nMago\\n, who rides with the \\nkhas\\n of \\nKo\\n \\nJhaqo\\n, rides up with angry words about Daenerys’\\nactions. After listening to both sides, Drogo explains to Daenerys that rape is part of the Dothraki way of war.\\nDaenerys insists that the Lhazareen women should be made wives and given a place in the \\nkhalasar\\n. A \\nbloodrider\\nnamed \\nQotho\\n asks haughtily if a horse breeds with sheep, but Daenerys replies that a dragon feeds on both horse and\\n\\nsheep. Drogo laughs at this and proclaims that his son inside her has made Daenerys fierce. The \\nkhal\\n goes on to tell\\nMago to find another lamb to mount, as these belong to the \\nkhaleesi\\n.\\nWhen Drogo reaches out to Daenerys, he winces and Daenerys cries for the healers. She is told that Drogo sent the\\nhealers away to tend the more grievously wounded. \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n, a Lhazareen woman Daenerys rescued, speaks\\nup, saying she can help. \\nAggo\\n is about to cut her throat when Daenerys demands that the woman, who wears the\\nremains of fine clothing, be allowed to speak. Mirri Maz Duur explains that she is a healer and \\ngodswife\\n. Drogo’s\\nbloodriders\\n mistrust her, naming her a healer of sheep and a \\nmaegi\\n.\\nDaenerys asks Mirri Maz Duur how she learned to become a healer, and the godswife states that she has learned\\nfrom many including a \\nmaester\\n named \\nMarwyn\\n. Talk of a maester immediately interests Ser Jorah, and he asks for\\ndetails. Ser Jorah then tells Daenerys that maesters know much of healing. Mirri Maz Duur explains that the \\nGreat\\nShepherd\\n sent her to earth to heal all his lambs. Drogo finally speaks up and permits the godswife to heal him. Mirri\\nMaz Duur suggests that the healing magic will be stronger inside her temple. Drogo rises to walk and falters, but he\\nrefuses \\nHaggo\\n’s offer to help. Seeing that her husband is weak, Daenerys moves up to help him, telling him that\\nsince she is not a man she can help him.\\nMirri Maz Duur brings Drogo into the remains of her temple and says it is best if the rest leave, but Daenerys and\\nthe bloodriders refuse. Daenerys assures everyone that Mirri Maz Duur will do no harm, feeling she can trust a\\nwoman she saved from rape. The godswife says if they insist on remaining they can help hold Drogo down. She\\npulls out the arrow, pours boiling wine on the wound, then sews the skin back in place. Next, she applies a plaster of\\nleaves to the chest wound and instructs Drogo not to drink wine or \\nmilk of the poppy\\n or to remove the poultice for\\nten days. When told he will have a great scar, Drogo declares, “I sing of my scars.”\\nDaenerys asks the godswife about an earlier comment about birthing songs and learns she is also a midwife.\\nTherefore, she asks Mirri Maz Duur to attend her when she gives birth. Drogo tells her, “You do not ask a slave, you\\ntell her.” Then Drogo commands that the \\nkhalasar\\n must ride and leaves. Qotho lingers long enough to remind the\\ngodswife, “As the \\nkhal\\n fares, so shall you.”\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys VI\\n↑\\nJon VIII\\n ←\\nDaenerys VII\\n→ \\nTyrion VIII\\n↓\\nDaenerys VIII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 62: Tyrion VIII\\nPlace(s): \\nBy the \\nGreen Fork\\n of the \\nTrident\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VII\\n↑\\nDaenerys VII\\n ←\\nTyrion VIII\\n→ \\nCatelyn X\\n↓\\nTyrion IX\\nTyrion\\n and his \\nclansmen\\n are assigned to the vanguard under the command of Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n.

In the ensuing \\nbattle on the Green Fork\\n, Tyrion and his clansmen do well and the enemy is routed.\\nAfterward Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n learns that Robb Stark has tricked him.\\nSynopsis\\nA long table draped with a golden cloth has been set up on a hill overlooking the \\nkingsroad\\n for Lord \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n and his chief knights and lords bannermen to take their evening meal. \\nTyrion\\n, arriving late, is embarrassed\\nas he waddles up to the table. Lord Tywin mocks that he will charge Tyrion with burying the dead if he arrives as\\nlate to battle as he does to table. Tyrion replies sourly that surely a peasant or two could be found for him to kill.\\nThe news from Ser \\nAddam Marbrand\\n is that \\nRobb Stark\\n has moved south from the \\nTwins\\n with \\nHouse Frey\\n’s levies\\nin tow and is now no more than a day away. Tyrion mockingly protests that he is about to eat and Tywin asks if the\\nthought of coming to grips with Robb unmans him. Tyrion jests that he would prefer to come to grips with the roast\\npig, which is far more tender and better smelling than Robb.\\nThe army’s quartermaster, Lord \\nLeo Lefford\\n, who has had to supply Tyrion’s 300 \\nclansmen\\n, uses this opportunity to\\nquip that he hopes the clansmen are braver than Tyrion or else they have wasted good steel. Tyrion assures him that\\nthe arms and armor will be put to good use. Ser \\nKevan\\n, who Tyrion knows is giving voice to Lord Tywin’s thoughts,\\ntakes the opportunity to inform Tyrion that he and his clansmen will fight in the vanguard since they seem so\\nferocious. Tyrion stresses the ferocity of the clansmen by recounting their recent lethal fight over a sausage.\\nLord Tywin uses this as evidence of a poor commander who cannot maintain discipline. Tyrion knows that \\nhis\\nbrother\\n could always make men follow him eagerly, but Tyrion lacks such charisma and must use gold and his\\nfamily name to get men to follow him. Tywin then tells Kevan that because the clansmen have no discipline, maybe\\nthey should not be in the vanguard. When Lord Tywin suggests that he should guard the baggage instead, Tyrion\\nangrily agrees to command the vanguard, only to learn that he will not command, but be under Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n.\\nDisgusted, Tyrion excuses himself after only eating one bite of the delicious pork.\\nTyrion gets lost in the camp but finds his way by following the sounds of \\nShagga\\n’s laughter in the dark. \\nConn\\n calls\\nfor him to share their meat and Tyrion agrees to join them when it is cooked, doubting that will be before the battle.\\nWhen he reaches his tent, he finds Bronn sharing wine with his new servants—a groom, a body servant, a squire\\nnamed \\nPodrick Payne\\n, and a slim young dark-haired whore named \\nShae\\n. Tyrion told Bronn to find him a young one\\nwith a pretty face and to be sure to tell her who and what he is, so as to avoid the displeasing look of revulsion that\\nsometimes greets him. He likes the girl Bronn has found.\\nTyrion invites Shae into his tent. When he asks if she is a maiden, Shae tells him that finding out will cost him\\ndouble and Tyrion decides they will get along fine. Tyrion explains that her duties besides sleeping with him include\\nserving him and monogamy. When they have sex, Shae expresses pleasure, which pleases Tyrion, who decides he\\ndoes not care if it is feigned. Tyrion also finds it good to be with a woman after nearly a year of enforced abstinence.\\n\\nAfterward, he sneaks out of the tent without waking Shae. Outside, he asks Bronn where he found her and is told\\nthat she was stolen from a knight because all the pretty ones were taken. Tyrion comments that he did not ask Bronn\\nto make him an enemy, but agrees to keep Shae. When Tyrion asks for the name of the knight so he can avoid him\\nin battle, Bronn insists that Tyrion will have him for protection. Tyrion then tells Bronn that if they both survive the\\nbattle, he can name his reward. Bronn asks who would want to kill Tyrion and Tyrion explains who has put them in\\nthe vanguard. Bronn only laughs and jests that a small man with a big shield will give the enemy archers fits.\\nTyrion returns to the tent to find Shae. When Tyrion asks whom Bronn has taken her from, she tells him that the\\nknight was a minor figure and a small man. Tyrion mockingly asks if she takes him for a giant, but Shae insists she\\ndoes, calling him ‘’my giant of Lannister.’’\\nTyrion wakes before dawn to battle horns and Shae’s cries. Outside, Bronn informs him that the \\nStark\\n host has come\\ndown the kingsroad at night and they are forming up for battle a mile north. Tyrion’s well-fitting suit of armor is at\\nCasterly Rock\\n, so Podrick Payne and Shae help him into the ill-fitting oddments that have replaced it. Tyrion asks\\nShae to weep for him if he dies, but she only asks how he will know. He is helped onto his heavily-armored horse\\nand given his battle-axe. Shae tells him he looks fearsome, but Tyrion disagrees. He instructs his squire Podrick to\\ntake her safely home if they lose. As the sun rises and he rides north, the clansmen fall in behind him.\\nOn the \\nbattlefield\\n, Lord Tywin commands the reserve in his magnificent armor that puts Jaime’s to shame. Ser\\nKevan commands the center and Ser Addam Marbrand the right, where Lord Tywin has massed his armored\\nknights. The northmen will be tired after their long sleepless march; Tyrion wonders what Robb Stark was thinking.\\nTyrion spies the massive Ser Gregor Clegane with the vanguard massing on the left. Bronn, looking at Ser Gregor,\\nstates that it is best to follow a big man into battle since he attracts all the archers, which Tyrion finds amusing. They\\nhear Ser Gregor tell his men that if anyone runs he will cut them down himself. Tyrion receives his orders to hold\\nthe left of the left next to the river. When Tyrion’s clansmen reach the \\nGreen Fork\\n, Tyrion commands them to keep\\nthemselves between the enemy and the river. Then the clansmen raise their battle cry of “Halfman!”\\nAlthough the van is all mounted, it is comprised of misfits and sweepings, including half-trained boys. Tyrion notes\\nthat the force is unfit to hold the left, and wonders what his father was thinking. When the enemy appears, their\\nnumbers seem great, but Tyrion knows that his father has more. He also notes that the Freys are among the enemy.\\nThe northerners charge and are answered first by the Lannister bowmen. Ser Gregor orders the charge, and the\\nclansmen quickly leave Tyrion in their dust. The charge nearly breaks against the \\nKarstark\\n spearmen opposing them,\\nbut Ser Gregor’s horse crashes through the shield wall as it dies. The monstrous knight rises from his fallen mount\\nand begins slaying men all around. Before the gap in the enemy line can close, Shagga rides through right behind\\nSer Gregor, followed by the other clansmen.\\nThe northmen’s line begins to crumble under the assault. Then Tyrion and Bronn are in the fight and Tyrion\\nsuccessfully defeats a number of enemies, including a close fight with a tall northerner whom Tyrion only\\novercomes because his horse bites the man’s cheek, giving Tyrion the opening to kill him. Then a knight with a\\nmorning star comes at Tyrion, wounding and unhorsing him. The knight calls for Tyrion to yield, but Tyion uses the\\nspike on his helmet to eviscerate the horse, which falls on the knight, disabling and trapping him. The knight yields\\nto Tyrion. Tyrion can now see that the battle has moved past him. The northerners are being pushed against the hills\\nand pelted by arrows. Finally, Bronn rides up and Tyrion sees his father ride by with the reserves to break the\\nnortherners. Tyrion finds the remnants of his clansmen, of whom perhaps half, including \\nConn\\n and \\nUlf son of Umar\\n,\\nare dead.\\nTyrion searches for his father and finds him sipping wine as his armor is removed. Lord Tywin tells him that his\\nclansmen fought well. Tyrion asks if that surprised him and if they were supposed to be butchered. Lord Tywin\\nadmits that he expected the left to collapse, hoping that Robb Stark would press into the breach where they might\\ncapture him. Tyrion demands to know why he was not informed. His father declares that a feigned rout is always\\nless convincing and that he is not in the habit of trusting men who consort with \\nsavages\\n and \\nsellswords\\n. Lord Tywin\\ncontinues that the Stark boy proved more cautious than expected, but it is a victory. Then Tywin notes that Tyrion is\\nwounded and Tyrion asks that he call for his \\nmaesters\\n.\\nAt that moment, Ser Addam Marbrand rides up with the news that Lord \\nCerwyn\\n, Ser \\nWylis Manderly\\n, \\nHarrion\\n\\nKarstark\\n, and four \\nFreys\\n were captured and Lord \\nHalys Hornwood\\n killed. The bad news follows: Lord \\nRoose Bolton\\nhas escaped, and Robb has crossed with most of his horse at the Twins and is riding hard for \\nRiverrun\\n. Tyrion\\nremembers his father’s words that the Stark boy would be more brave than wise and thinks that he would laugh if it\\ndidn\\'t hurt so much.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VII\\n↑\\nDaenerys VII\\n ←\\nTyrion VIII\\n→ \\nCatelyn X\\n↓\\nTyrion IX\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 63: Catelyn X\\nPlace(s): \\nthe \\nWhispering Wood\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn IX\\n↑\\nTyrion VIII\\n ←\\nCatelyn X\\n→ \\nDaenerys VIII\\n↓\\nCatelyn XI\\nRobb Stark\\n has managed to lead his host to \\nRiverrun\\n without detection. Now \\nCatelyn\\n waits with her guards as her\\nson leads his host to \\nambush\\n Ser \\nJaime Lannister\\n. Once the battle is over, Robb returns with Jaime as a captive.\\nHowever, the death of several of Robb\\'s party mars the sweetness of the victory.\\nSynopsis\\nCatelyn\\n is protected by thirty men under the command of \\nHallis Mollen\\n, \\nWinterfell\\n\\'s captain of the \\nguard\\n, as \\nRobb\\n’s\\nhost waits to descend upon Ser \\nJaime Lannister\\n in the \\nWhispering Wood\\n. Robb had wanted to leave her fifty guards\\nand Catelyn had only wanted ten, so neither of them left happy.\\nRobb’s army rode hard from the \\nTwins\\n to catch Jaime by surprise. Along the way, they were joined by the\\nMallisters\\n and some of the forces scattered after \\nEdmure’s\\n \\ndefeat\\n, but Ser Jaime Lannister still outnumbers them\\nthree to one. However, in order to besiege \\nRiverrun\\n the \\nLannisters\\n were forced to separate their twelve thousand foot\\nand two or three thousand horse into three camps separated by rivers, which leaves them vulnerable. In addition,\\nCatelyn’s uncle, Ser \\nBrynden\\n, led a screening force of three hundred picked men to kill the few outriders that Jaime\\nbothered to post, allowing their advance to remain secret.\\nBefore they face the siege, however, Robb and his men have concocted an elaborate trap. Unable to endure the\\nboredom of a siege, Jaime has personally ridden out three times to chase raiders. To exploit this, Robb sent a few\\nhundred men with \\nTully\\n banners to lure Jaime and his men into an ambush in the narrow valley of the Whispering\\nWood.\\nAs she waits, Catelyn realizes that she is again waiting for a man who has promised to return from war, as she has\\ndone all her life. First, she waited for \\nher father\\n when she was young. Then it was for \\nBrandon Stark\\n, who never\\ncame back. Then she waited for \\nNed Stark\\n, who left a fortnight after he married her to fight in \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n. At\\nleast Ned left her pregnant with Robb, whom she must wait for now.\\nRobb shows no fear as the battle approaches, but Catelyn still fears for the life of her son, remembering him as a\\nbabe at her breast. As Robb’s squire \\nOlyvar Frey\\n helps with his shield and helm, Catelyn sees a tall young knight\\nappear where her son had stood. Robb leaves her to let his men see him before the battle, as his father had once\\nrecommended, with his \\ndirewolf\\n \\nGrey Wind\\n shadowing him.\\nWhile she waits, Catelyn hears \\nsnow shrikes\\n, which remind her of Winterfell. Suddenly, horns blow and arrows fly\\nas the trap closes. Catelyn can initially see the moonlight on the lances, but soon she can only hear the sounds of the\\nbattle in the Whispering Wood\\n. Eventually the sounds fade, and then Robb returns on a different horse with the\\nblood of one of his bodyguards on his arm. They drag Jaime before Catelyn, and the captive declares that he would\\noffer up his sword, but he seems to have mislaid it. Catelyn asks Jaime to return her husband and daughters, but he\\nreplies that he seems to have mislaid them as well.\\nTheon Greyjoy\\n calls for Jaime\\'s head but Robb considers the Kingslayer more valuable alive and, like his father\\nNed, refuses to condone the murder of prisoners. Robb orders Jaime taken away with a strong guard in part to\\nprotect him from Lord \\nRickard Karstark\\n, who will want vengeance for his sons \\nTorrhen\\n and \\nEddard\\n along with\\n\\nDaryn Hornwood\\n. Catelyn then learns that when Jaime saw he was lost, he charged Robb’s party, hoping to cut\\ndown Robb. Robb states that he would be dead if not for Lord Karstark’s sons and the others.\\nDespite these losses, the battle is a resounding victory for Robb. They have taken close to a hundred knights and a\\ndozen lords bannermen captive. Catelyn points out that they have only won one battle, not the war. Although they\\ntook the leader, most of the Lannister host is still besieging Riverrun, and they still have to deal with Lord \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n. Robb agrees that Catelyn is right, and declares that they still have the siege of Riverrun to defeat.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn IX\\n↑\\nTyrion VIII\\n ←\\nCatelyn X\\n→ \\nDaenerys VIII\\n↓\\nCatelyn XI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 64: Daenerys VIII\\nPlace(s): \\nDothraki Sea\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys VII\\n↑\\nCatelyn X\\n ←\\nDaenerys VIII\\n→ \\nArya V\\n↓\\nDaenerys IX\\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n falls off his horse. \\nDaenerys\\n orders the \\nkhalasar\\n to halt and calls for \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n. The godswife\\ndeclares that only blood magic can save Drogo. As the rite is being performed, Drogo’s \\nbloodriders\\n attempt to\\nintervene. A fight ensues in which Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n is injured and all of Drogo’s bloodriders are killed. Daenerys\\nstarts to hemorrhage and Ser Jorah carries her into Drogo\\'s tent.\\nSynopsis\\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n is looking drawn and swaying in his saddle. He makes no reaction as the large \\nbloodflies\\n circle and bite\\nhim. This concerns \\nDaenerys\\n who is used to seeing her husband catch the hated insects with his hands, quick as a\\nsnake, when they come too near. Drogo tore off the poultice \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n had prepared for him six days ago,\\ncomplaining that it itched. Instead, he used the soothing mud plaster of the herb women. He has also been drinking\\npoppy wine, fermented mare’s milk, and pepper beer heavily but not eating much. At night, he thrashes violently\\nand even the kicking of their unborn child not longer seems to interest him.\\nAs Daenerys reaches for him, Drogo reels from the saddle and falls heavily to the ground. Daenerys rushes to him.\\nOnly half conscious and struggling in her arms, Drogo insists that he must ride, for the \\nkhal\\n who cannot ride is no\\nkhal\\n. Now Drogo has fallen from his horse and it has been seen. When Drogo’s \\nbloodriders\\n come up, Daenerys\\ncommands that they will halt for the day and that the slaves be called to erect Drogo’s tent. The bloodriders are not\\nhappy with either command; the region is not a camping ground and a woman cannot command. Daenerys insists\\nthat Drogo will punish them if they do not obey her and commands \\nQotho\\n to find Mirri Maz Duur.\\nOnce the tent is erected, Daenerys and her handmaidens bring the feverish Drogo inside and bathe him. Finally, Ser\\nJorah Mormont\\n arrives with word that Drogo’s fall is known all over the camp. He asks Daenerys to send her maids\\naway and breaks the plaster from Drogo’s wound. The wound has festered and is rank with corruption. Ser Jorah\\ndeclares that Drogo is beyond saving and that they must flee before he dies.\\nDaenerys asks why she should run, since her son will be \\nkhal\\n after Drogo. Ser Jorah explains that the \\nDothraki\\nfollow only the strong; the \\nkhalasar\\n will not follow a baby. Instead, the \\nko\\ns will fight for the leadership and her baby\\nwill be killed as a challenge to their authority. Daenerys insists that her \\nkhas\\n and Drogo’s bloodriders will keep her\\nchild safe, but Jorah reminds her that the bloodriders\\' last duty is only to return her to the \\ndosh khaleen\\n in \\nVaes\\nDothrak\\n and then follow their \\nkhal\\n. Daenerys does not want to return to join the \\ndosh khaleen\\n, but she also refuses to\\nleave Drogo.\\nMirri Maz Duur arrives with Qotho, looking exhausted. Both Qotho and \\nHaggo\\n, taking one look at Drogo, blame the\\ngodwife and start beating her. When Daenerys demands that they stop, Qotho threatens to take Daenerys out to be\\nraped along with the \\nmaegi\\n. Ser Jorah intervenes and eventually the bloodriders leave.\\nAfter they leave, Ser Jorah explains that the bloodriders die with their \\nkhal\\n and are now beyond fear because they\\nsee their death approaching. Daenerys tells Ser Jorah to don his armor. Once the knight has left, Daenerys tells Mirri\\nMaz Duur to heal Drogo. The godswife states that he is beyond help and will be gone by morning. Daenerys pleads\\nwith her, insisting that there must be a way, a magical way. Mirri Maz Duur admits she does know some dark magic\\nlearned at great cost from a bloodmage from the \\nShadow Lands\\n; it will cost a life. Daenerys asks if it means her life,\\n\\nbut Mirri Maz Duur assures her it does not.\\nThey lower Drogo into a bath and bring his stallion into the tent. \\nJhogo\\n pleads with Daenerys not to use forbidden\\nbloodmagic and to allow him to kill the \\nmaegi\\n. It takes \\nRakharo\\n, \\nQuaro\\n, and \\nAggo\\n to force the frightened stallion to\\nthe tub while Mirri Maz Duur chants. The godswife uses a red bronze knife covered in glyphs to cut the horse’s\\nthroat and fill the tub with blood. The godswife then orders Daenerys, who is now filled with fear, to leave the tent;\\nno one must look upon the old and dark powers the godswife’s spell will wake. Outside, the gathered crowd stares at\\nher. When Ser Jorah, now in his armor, sees the bloody footprints Daenerys leaves he asks what foolish thing she\\nhas done.\\nDaenerys can hear the \\nmaegi’s\\n voice and see the shadows moving inside the tent. The Dothraki start to mutter and\\ndraw back. Drogo’s bloodriders return with the healing eunuchs. When Qotho sees what is happening he moves\\ntoward the tent, intending to kill Mirri Maz Duur and then Daenerys. He pushes Daenerys aside as she tries to\\ninterfere and she screams for her \\nkhas\\n to stop him. Quaro is quickly cut down, but Ser Jorah steps forward to\\nconfront Qotho. Without his helmet, the knight is hard pressed by Qotho’s rapid strikes. Then Qotho’s \\narakh\\n cuts\\ninto Ser Jorah’s hip and catches on the bone, giving Ser Jorah the opportunity to kill him.\\nMeanwhile, the other bloodriders and members of Daenerys’ \\nkhas\\n have also come to battle. Jhogo’s whip catches\\nHaggo\\n around the neck, giving Rakharo the chance to kill him. Daenerys is hemorrhaging from the birth of her child\\nand crawling toward the tent, screaming that the price is too high. The bloodrider \\nCohollo\\n catches her and is about to\\nkill her when \\nAggo\\n’s arrow takes him in the chest.\\nWhen Daenerys raises her head again, the crowd is dispersing. Some are saddling horses and riding off as the sun\\nsets. She cannot rise and the shadows are whirling inside the tent. Ser Jorah comes to assist her and calls for her\\nhandmaids to get the birthing women. \\nDoreah\\n informs him that they believe Daenerys is cursed and are gone. Then\\nshe hears someone (possibly Aggo) telling them to take her to the \\nmaegi\\n. Daenerys knows she does not want to go\\ninto the tent, but cannot speak. \\nIrri\\n and Doreah both agree that they heard Mirri Maz Duur say she knows about\\nbirthing.\\nSer Jorah carries Daenerys into the tent.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys VII\\n↑\\nCatelyn X\\n ←\\nDaenerys VIII\\n→ \\nArya V\\n↓\\nDaenerys IX\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 65: Arya V\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya IV\\n↑\\nDaenerys VIII\\n ←\\nArya V\\n→ \\nBran VII\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nArya I\\nArya\\n is surviving on the streets of \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n by hunting pigeons.

Once the confession is done, King \\nJoffrey\\n demands his head.\\nArya attempts to get to him, but \\nYoren\\n of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n stops her. Afterward, he declares that she is coming\\nwith him.\\nSynopsis\\nArya\\n is catching pigeons on the Street of Flour. Compared with catching cats, pigeons are easy. She uses her\\nwooden practice sword to knock one from the air and snaps its neck.\\nAfter taking the pigeon, Arya walks by a cart filled with tarts. When she asks for one, she is charged three coppers\\nshe doesn’t have. The man also declines to trade for her pigeon. Arya uses the seeing taught by \\nSyrio Forel\\n and\\ndecides she could steal one and get away, but the seller guesses her intention and points out the two \\ngold cloaks\\nclose by. Even though they are paying her no attention, the sight of the gold cloaks ties Arya\\'s stomach in knots and\\nshe lets the man pass.\\nAt the \\nRed Keep\\n, which she avoids, Arya can see the heads rotting on spikes. There are all sorts of stories among the\\nsmallfolk: Lord \\nRenly\\n killed King \\nRobert\\n and fled, or the king died hunting a boar, or the king died \\neating\\n a boar, or\\nthe king was poisoned by \\nVarys\\n or by the \\nqueen\\n. The stories only agree that the king is dead.\\nArya wants to leave \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, but the seven city gates are either closed completely, open only to entering, or\\nclosely guarded by \\nLannister\\n guardsmen and gold cloaks, who search everything and ask questions. Once she\\nconsidered swimming the river, but the current is treacherous and she cannot afford a ferry or a ship. Arya imagines\\nthat if she can escape to the countryside, she can dig for roots, find orchards, pick berries, and travel north.\\nThere are pot shops in \\nFlea Bottom\\n where she can get her birds cooked or exchanged for some bread or stew, but the\\npeople in them seem dangerous. Arya has even been chased a couple of times when leaving, probably for her boots\\nor cloak, but she outran them. She often goes hungry rather than endure the stares of the people in the pot shops. The\\nfirst night she spent on the street, her silver bracelet and her bundle of good clothes were stolen while she slept. All\\nthe thieves left her were the clothes and cloak she was wearing, her practice sword, and her real sword “\\nNeedle\\n,”\\nwhich she was sleeping on.\\nShe misses her brothers. She tried to talk to the other children, but must have talked wrong (likely with a \\nnorthern\\naccent) because the young ones all ran away and the older ones asked questions, called her names, or tried to steal\\nfrom her. One girl, twice her age, even knocked her down to try to steal her boots and was rewarded with a smack\\nfrom Arya\\'s practice sword.\\nOn her daily circuit to check the city gates, Arya decides to go to the riverfront on her way to the \\nMud Gate\\n to see if\\nshe might be able to stow away on a ship. The wharfs are too quiet. On a pier she sees men in the livery of\\nWinterfell\\n guarding a ship. She learns from a passing longshoreman that the ship is called the \\nWind Witch\\n out of\\nMyr\\n, which is the same ship that her father contracted to take her and \\nSansa\\n home. As she approaches the ship, Arya\\n\\nsuddenly remembers to use the seeing that Syrio taught her again and realizes she does not know the guards. They\\ncall to her and she plays the part of a boy trying to sell them the pigeon, knowing they will recognize her if she runs.\\nThe ploy works and they send her away dismissively.\\nSomehow, Arya finds her way back to Flea Bottom and discovers her pigeon is gone, either stolen or dropped. Then\\nshe hears the bells of \\nBaelor\\'s Sept\\n and wonders what it means this time. From one of the passersby she hears that it\\nis a summoning and from another she hears that the gold cloaks are carrying the \\nHand of the King\\n to the sept.\\nArya follows the masses. All around her the townsfolk are discussing \\nher father\\n and the rumors of his treason. She\\npushes through the crowd and finds herself next to the statue of \\nBaelor the Blessed\\n, the \\nSepton\\n King, and climbs up\\nso she can see. From this vantage point she can see her father supported by two gold cloaks in a rich velvet doublet\\nand a grey cloak, his face drawn with pain and thinner than Arya has ever seen. With him on the pulpit are the \\nHigh\\nSepton\\n, King \\nJoffrey\\n, Queen \\nCersei\\n, \\nthe Hound\\n, four other members of the \\nKingsguard\\n, \\nVarys\\n, \\nLittlefinger\\n, and\\nSansa\\n; Arya wonders why Sansa is there and why she looks so happy.\\nThen her father makes a speech in which he confesses that he betrayed the trust of King Robert. A stone from the\\ncrowd strikes him, causing a gash on his face and more stones follow. The High Septon intones that Blessed Baelor\\ntaught mercy along with justice and asks Joffrey for his verdict. Joffrey declares that his mother and his betrothed\\nhave requested that Lord Eddard be allowed to \\ntake the black\\n. Then he declares that while he is king treason shall\\nnever go unpunished, and calls for Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n to bring him Eddard’s head. This causes an uproar around Joffrey\\nas the High Septon, Cersei, and even Varys protest the decree.\\nArya jumps to the ground, drawing Needle, but the crowd quickly engulfs her. She sees Ser Ilyn raise \\nIce\\n—he has\\nIce!—and hears Sansa screaming. She continues to fight toward them, using Needle to cut a path. A hand shoots out\\nto grab her and hold her tight, forcing her to drop her sword. The smelly old man who has grabbed her tells her not\\nto look and calls her a boy. Then she hears a soft sighing noise.\\nArya looks at the smelly man and recognizes him as \\nYoren\\n of the Night’s Watch, who talked with her father. He\\ntells her to keep her mouth shut and that she is coming with him. Yoren shakes her hard when she tries to speak.\\nOnce the crowd starts to disperse, he hands her back Needle, saying that he hopes she can use it. He keeps calling\\nher a boy and does not give her the opportunity to deny it, insisting that she is trying to say she is not a smart boy.\\nYoren shoves her inside a doorway and a blade flashes at Arya’s face; she wrenches back her head but cannot\\nescape because Yoren has a strong grip on her hair.\\nNavigation:\\nArya IV\\n↑\\nDaenerys VIII\\n ←\\nArya V\\n→ \\nBran VII\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nArya I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 66: Bran VII\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran VII\\n↑\\nArya V\\n ←\\nBran VII\\n→ \\nSansa VI\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nBran I\\nBran\\n and \\nRickon\\n have the same dream about seeing \\ntheir father\\n in the \\ncrypt of Winterfell\\n. \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n takes Bran\\ndown to the crypts to show him his father is not there. They find Rickon already there. They go back to the\\nmaester’s turret where Luwin tells them about the coming of the \\nFirst Men\\n, the treaty with the \\nchildren of the forest\\nand the coming of the \\nAndals\\n. A raven arrives with news of Lord Eddard’s death.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n is watching Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n train the new young recruits in the yard of \\nWinterfell\\n. \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n is taking\\nmeasurements of the comet through his lens tube. Bran comments that the recruits do not fight very well, and is told\\nthat Lord \\nEddard\\n took the cream of the guard with him to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n and then \\nRobb\\n took the rest along with all\\nthe likely men for leagues around; men are needed to walk the walls of \\nWinterfell\\n. Bran stares resentfully at the boys\\nbelow, remembering how he knocked Prince \\nTommen\\n down many times. Then Bran suggests that he could fight\\nfrom \\nHodor\\n’s back, but Luwin dismisses the idea as impractical. Bran talks about the blind knight \\nSymeon Star-\\nEyes\\n, but Luwin insists that that is only a story and that Bran must put his dreams aside.\\nThe mention of dreams reminds Bran of his new dream of the \\nthree-eyed crow\\n, a dream that was very sad. He tells\\nLuwin how the crow brought him down to the crypts and his father was there. His father was sad because of \\nJon\\n.\\nWhen he woke up, Bran wanted to go down to the crypts to see if his father was there, but \\nHodor\\n would not take\\nhim. Luwin tells Bran that Eddard will be down there someday, but not be for many years. Bran insists the dream\\nwas real and that his father was there. In order to dispel the boy’s delusion, Maester Luwin calls for \\nOsha\\n, who tells\\nthem that she has lived \\nbeyond the Wall\\n, so a hole in the ground will not scare her. Because of Osha’s good\\nbehavior, her chains have been removed, but the shackles remain to show she is not totally trusted. She carries Bran\\nin her arms, but he does not mind.\\nThe vault seems very dark and gloomy. Summer and Osha seem uncomfortable. When Bran states that the men\\nrepresented by the granite statues were the \\nKings of Winter\\n, Osha tells him that winter has no king; if he had seen a\\nwinter he would know. They proceed down the long corridor, past the statues, but Summer refuses to leave the steps.\\nBran tells the accomplishments of the different lords and kings: \\nJon Stark\\n, \\nRickard Stark\\n, \\nTheon Stark\\n, \\nBrandon the\\nShipwright\\n, \\nBrandon the Burner\\n, \\nRodrik Stark\\n, \\nTorrhen Stark\\n, and \\nCregan Stark\\n. When they get to the end with the\\nstatues of \\nBrandon Stark\\n, \\nLyanna Stark\\n and Lord \\nRickard Stark\\n, Luwin sticks his arm into the future tomb of\\nEddard, and \\nShaggydog\\n springs out and savages Maester Luwin\\'s arm.\\nBran calls for Summer, who slams into Shaggydog, knocking the wolf off Luwin. Osha goes to assist Luwin. As the\\nwolves fight, Rickon appears at the mouth of Eddard’s tomb, telling Luwin to leave his father be. When Bran tells\\nRickon father is not there, Rickon states that he saw him last night, and that he is coming home. Luwin, now looking\\nunsure, tells Rickon that Shaggydog was supposed to be chained. Rickon replies that he does not like to be chained,\\nand Luwin states that he is now the third man Shaggydog has savaged and it will only be a matter of time before he\\nkills someone. Bran calmly states they will wait in Maester Luwin\\'s tower, which Luwin states is quite impossible.\\nOsha replies that Bran is the lord. Rickon agrees to come if Shaggy comes too. Maester Luwin reluctantly follows.\\nThey enter Maester Luwin\\'s cluttered turret, where Osha bandaged the maester\\'s wound, following his instructions.\\n\\nLuwin tries to explain to the boys about the logic of them both dreaming the same dream. He says that Rickon is too\\nyoung to understand, to which Rickon states that he is four. Then he tells Bran that he is old enough to know that\\ndreams are just dreams. Osha adds in that some dreams are just dreams and some are not; the \\nchildren of the forest\\ncould teach him something about dreams.\\nBran starts to go into the stories that \\nOld Nan\\n told about the children of the forest: they knew the songs of the trees,\\nflew like birds, swam like fish, talked to animals, and made beautiful music. The maester says that a man who trusts\\nin spells duels with a glass sword. Luwin takes out several arrowheads made of \\ndragonglass\\n, or \\nobsidian\\n, which the\\nchildren of the forest forged. He tells them that the children used shirts of woven leaves and greaves of bark in place\\nof armor and carried blades of obsidian; Osha comments that they still do. Bran and Rickon each take some\\narrowheads.\\n\\'The children lived during the \\nDawn Age\\n, before the coming of men in the land now called the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n.\\nThey lived in the depths of the woods, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Their wise men were called\\ngreenseers\\n and carved the faces in the \\nweirwoods\\n to watch over the forest. No one knows how long they reigned or\\nwhere they came from.\\' Twelve thousand years ago, the \\nFirst Men\\n crossed the \\nBroken Arm\\n of \\nDorne\\n before it was\\nbroken. The First Men were mounted, tall of stature, and wielded bronze weapons.\\nThe First Men chopped down the weirwood trees to build holdfasts, and the enraged children of the forest started a\\nwar. The \\ngreenseers\\n supposedly used dark magic to make the sea rise and break the landmass that is now the broken\\narm of \\nDorne\\n. Finally, a truce was called and the leaders of both races met on the \\nIsle of Faces\\n in the \\nGods Eye\\n.\\nAfter the \\nPact\\n was forged, the greenmen formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces and the First Men eventually\\nadopted the \\nold gods\\n worshiped by the children. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age and began the \\nAge of\\nHeroes\\n. The Pact started 4000 years of friendship between the children and the First Men. While the kingdoms of\\nthe First Men endured, so did the Pact, all through the Age of Heroes, the \\nLong Night\\n, and the birth of the Seven\\nKingdoms.\\nEventually the \\nAndal\\n invaders came with steel, fire, and the seven-pointed star of the \\nnew gods\\n. The war lasted for\\nhundreds of years, and the Andals burned most of the weirwoods remaining in the south, slaughtering the children\\nwhere they found them. The children fled north. During the story, Osha adds that there are still children north of the\\nWall\\n, and also giants, and other old races; Maester Luwin is not happy with Osha filling the two boys with folly.\\nLuwin’s tale is cut off when the two \\ndirewolves\\n start howling. Now Bran is sure that he knew it. The direwolves\\nquiet and a bloodied messenger raven appears. Even Maester Luwin is not sure he wants to know what is in the\\nmessage. Bran, hugging Rickon hard, asks about the message and Osha tells him he knows, while putting a hand\\ngently on his head. Maester Luwin reads the message and tears up as he tells them that they will need to find a stone\\ncarver that knew their father’s likeness well.\\nNavigation:\\nBran VII\\n↑\\nArya V\\n ←\\nBran VII\\n→ \\nSansa VI\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nBran I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 67: Sansa VI\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa VI\\n↑\\nBran VII\\n ←\\nSansa VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys IX\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nSansa I\\nSansa\\n is in a depression after the execution of \\nher father\\n. \\nJoffrey\\n arrives to browbeat her into attending him in court.\\nAfter court, Joffrey takes her to the ramparts to see the heads of her father and household.

The Hound then tells her “Do as\\nyou are bid, child; dress.” He pushes her to the wardrobe almost gently.\\nShe tells Joffrey that she did as she was asked and now only wants to go \\nhome\\n. Joffrey tells her that he is still to\\nmarry her, so she will stay here. She responds that she does not want to marry him because he killed her father\\ndespite promising mercy. Joffrey insists he was merciful: he gave her father a clean death. Sansa now truly sees\\nJoffrey for the first time, and cannot believe she ever found him handsome. Sansa whispers that she hates him.\\nJoffrey tells her that his mother has said he should not strike his wife, so he orders Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n to strike her\\nwith the back of his gloved fist. Sansa sprawls to the floor, her ear bloody. She agrees to attend court and everyone\\nbut the Hound leaves. The Hound tells her that she should save herself some pain and give Joffrey what he wants:\\nshe is to smile, smell sweet, and be his lady love.\\nTwo maids creep timidly into the chamber. Sansa instructs them to prepare a bath and to get powder to hide the\\nbruise on her face. She is amazed at how dirty her bathwater becomes, not having washed since her father’s\\nexecution. She chooses the green silk gown she wore at the \\nTourney of the Hand\\n when Joffery was sweet to her—\\nmaybe he will remember and be gentle.\\nSer Meryn escorts her to the throne room. From her observation of Ser Meryn, Sansa realizes that he feels nothing\\ntowards her; she is only an object. Sansa tells Ser Meryn that he is no true knight, which she thinks the Hound would\\nfind amusing, but she gets no reaction.\\nShe is alone on the balcony as Joffrey dispenses what he considers justice. Mostly he lets his \\nsmall council\\n make the\\n\\ndecisions, but when he intervenes he will not be dissuaded. She sees the ugly face of \\nJanos Slynt\\n at the council table\\nand remembers how he threw down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead. She also notices how he nods approvingly at\\neach of Joffrey’s brutal judgements. She wishes some hero would cut off his head but knows there are no heroes,\\nremembering \\nPetyr Baelish\\n telling her that life is not a song. Sansa thinks “In life, the monsters win.” The last case\\nis a singer accused of singing a song ridiculing King \\nRobert Baratheon\\n. He is made to sing the song before the court\\nand Sansa thinks it is funny; in some verses it seems like he is singing about the queen. Joffrey gives the man the\\noption of keeping his fingers or his tongue.\\nWhen the court is dismissed, Sansa flees the balcony only to be met by Joffrey, Ser Meryn, and the Hound. Joffrey\\nexamines her and tells her she looks much better. Sansa thanks him with hollow words. Joffrey then tells her to walk\\nwith him—the touch of his hand now makes her skin crawl. He asks her what she will get him for his coming name\\nday, but Sansa admits that she was unaware it was near. Joffrey tells her that she is truly a stupid girl, and that his\\nmother has said so and is worried their children will be stupid as well. Despite her expectations, the words still hurt\\nSansa and she realizes that the Hound was right: she is “only a little bird, repeating the words they taught her.”\\nJoffrey then tells her that he will get her with child as soon as possible, and if the child is stupid, she will lose her\\nhead and he will find a smarter wife. He asks when she can have children and she tells him, not being able to look at\\nhim, that Septa \\nMordane\\n told her twelve or thirteen.\\nSansa now realizes they are going up onto the battlements and begs not to go there. Joffrey insists that he wants to\\nshow her how traitors are punished. He also threatens to have Ser Meryn drag her if she refuses. The Hound\\nencourages her to go and Sansa realizes that one way or the other she must go up, so she goes willingly. It seems\\nlike she climbs a thousand steps to the top. Sansa looks out across the city to the countryside beyond and lets her\\nimagination cross the hundreds of leagues north to her home in Winterfell. Joffrey demands to know what she is\\nlooking at and instructs her to look at the heads of her father, her septa, and a dozen more. Her father’s head does\\nnot look recognizable or even real. Sansa decides that they can make her look, but they cannot make her see. Joffrey\\nis disappointed by Sansa’s hollow and stoic reaction.\\nSansa cannot understand why they would kill Septa Mordane, but Joffrey insists she was a traitor as well. He asks\\nagain what Sansa will give him for his name day as a preamble to declaring that instead he will bring Sansa the head\\nof her traitor brother \\nRobb\\n. Joffrey explains that Robb used treachery and deceit to defeat his \\nUncle Jaime\\n. Sansa\\nsuggests that Robb may give her Joffrey’s head. This mistake results in two harder blows by Ser Meryn. Joffrey\\ncommands her to clean off the blood.\\nFor a fleeting moment, Sansa realizes that it would only take a shove to send Joffrey over the parapet to splatter far\\nbelow. Just as suddenly, the moment is gone when the Hound comes between her and Joffrey to dab the blood from\\nher broken lip with surprising gentleness. She thanks the Hound; she is a good girl and remembers her courtesies.\\nNavigation:\\nSansa VI\\n↑\\nBran VII\\n ←\\nSansa VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys IX\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nSansa I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 68: Daenerys IX\\nPlace(s): \\nDothraki Sea\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys VIII\\n↑\\nSansa VI\\n ←\\nDaenerys IX\\n→ \\nTyrion IX\\n↓\\nDaenerys X\\nDaenerys\\n has terrible nightmares during her long recovery. She wakes to learn that \\nher child\\n was born dead, a\\ntwisted monstrosity. When she visits with Drogo he is comatose, but \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n insist that he is alive.\\nDaenerys is horrified by the cost of the bloodmagic. That night, she attempts to revive Drogo, but by morning knows\\nhe is gone forever and smothers him with a pillow.\\nSynopsis\\nIn her dreams, \\nDaenerys\\n keeps hearing, \\n“You do not want to wake the dragon, do you?”\\n She is walking down a hall,\\nher bare feet leaving bloody footprints. Suddenly she is with \\nDrogo\\n under the open sky of the \\nDothraki Sea\\n. Drogo\\nis stroking her, waking her passion, and when he enters her the stars are gone, great wings fill the sky, and the world\\ntakes flame. Then she sees Ser \\nJorah’s\\n drawn and sorrowful face telling her that the last dragon was \\nRhaegar\\nTargaryen\\n while standing over a hot brazier containing red-hot stone eggs. In turn, he is replaced by \\nViserys\\n with his\\nmolten gold crown screaming \\n“The dragon does not beg, slut,”\\n and \\n“I will be crowned.”\\n Then he painfully pinches\\nher nipples and suddenly Daenerys is frantically running to a distant \\nred door\\n that is her salvation. She knows that\\nthe darkness is there, but she does not dare look back or she will be lost. She sees \\nher son\\n as a grown warrior, proud\\nand tall, before flames consume him. Then the \\nghosts of kings\\n are lining the hallway urging her to go faster. Then\\nshe is flying over the \\nDothraki Sea\\n, and all are fleeing before her. She finally throws open the red door to see her\\nbrother Rhaegar, the last dragon, in his armor, but when she opens his visor she sees her own face.\\nDaenerys wakes to the taste of ashes, with \\nJhiqui\\n standing over her. Her body hurts very much. She calls for\\nsomething, but does not know what. Jhiqui says “Yes,” and bolts from the tent shouting. When they return,\\nDaenerys is crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah carries her back to bed and tells her to sleep and then \\nMirri\\nMaz Duur\\n gives her something in a cup. A dreamless sleep takes her.\\nIt is dark when Daenerys wakes again. She calls for her handmaidens and they attend to her. They tell her that she\\nhas been sick for a long time. Then Mirri Maz Duur gives her wine and as she falls asleep, asking for a dragon’s\\negg. The next time she wakes, Daenerys has the pale dragon’s egg in her arms and it is warm. There is fine sheen of\\nperspiration on her that she names “dragon’s dew.” There is no fever and she feels strong. She calls for her\\nhandmaidens and asks for a bath, Mirri Maz Duur, Ser Jorah, Drogo, and her child. Her handmaids avoid answering\\nabout Drogo and her child, and Daenerys knows that her child is dead.\\nMirri Maz Duur and Ser Jorah enter to find Daenerys standing over the other eggs, which are all warm. However,\\nwhen asked, Ser Jorah does not feel the heat from the eggs. Ser Jorah looks gaunt and limps from his wounds. He\\ntells Daenerys that her son never lived, but Mirri Maz Duur tells her that the child was monstrous: lizard-like, with\\nscales; his skin fell off, revealing a body filled with grave worms and the stink of corruption, as if he had been dead\\nfor years. She states that her son was strong when Ser Jorah brought her into the tent. Mirri Maz Duur explains that\\ndeath was in the tent and that the shadows touched her.\\nDaenerys realizes that Ser Jorah killed her child by taking her into the tent, for love and loyalty to her. Daenerys\\nstates that she thought the life of the horse would be payment enough and is told that was a lie she told herself.\\nDaenerys is not sure if she knew. Daenerys realizes that the life of the horse, her son, \\nQuaro\\n, \\nQotho\\n, \\nHaggo\\n, and\\nCohollo\\n paid for the life of Drogo. She asks to see what the price bought. Ser Jorah cannot dissuade her and has to\\n\\nhelp her stand since she is weaker than she thought.\\nOutside, in the glaring sun, Daenerys can see there is little left: a scattering of tents, a few score of horses, and\\nperhaps a hundred people. They are the old, the frightened, and the sick. \\nJhogo\\n reminds her that a \\nkhal\\n who cannot\\nride is no \\nkhal\\n. She learns that \\nKo\\n \\nPono\\n declared himself \\nkhal\\n first, and \\nJhaqo\\n after him. They took most of the\\nriders, the herds, and the slaves because Daenerys’ own \\nkhas\\n was too weak to stop them; it is the right of the strong\\nto take from the weak. Most of the rest left during the following nights. \\nMago\\n, now a \\nbloodrider\\n to Khal Jhaqo,\\nseized \\nEroeh\\n (whom Daenerys had denied him) and raped and murdered her. Daenerys repeats her mantra, “If I look\\nback I am lost,” and swears that Mago and Jhaqo will die screaming. Irri warns her that Jhaqo now has 20,000\\nriders, but Daenerys insists that she is \\nthe blood of the dragon\\n. Then she asks to see Drogo.\\nDrogo lies unmoving, unseeing, and covered in \\nbloodflies\\n. Daenerys asks why he is outside alone and Ser Jorah\\nexplains that he seems to like the warmth and staring at the sun with eyes that cannot see. He will follow where led\\nand eat if food is put in his mouth, but otherwise does nothing. Daenerys faces Mirri Maz Duur, who insists that\\nDrogo \\nis\\n alive. Daenerys responds that such is not life for a man that was as alive as Drogo. Then Daenerys asks\\nMirri Maz Duur when Drogo will be as he was. The \\nmaegi\\n replies,\\n“When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like\\nleaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.”\\nDaenerys sends the others away and then accuses Mirri Maz Duur of knowing, of cheating her and murdering her\\nchild. Mirri Maz Duur replies that it was wrong of the \\nkhalasar\\n to burn her temple, and now the \\nStallion Who\\nMounts the World\\n will burn no cities and trample no nations. Daenerys reminds the \\nmaegi\\n that she saved her, but\\nMirri Maz Duur asks what Daenerys saved when three warriors had already raped her, burned her home and her\\ntemple, and cut off the heads of her neighbors and friends. Daenerys insists that she saved her life, but the \\nmaegi\\ntells her to look at her \\nkhal\\n and see what life is worth when all else is gone. Daenerys orders her men to bind Mirri\\nMaz Duur and take her away; the woman only smiles at her.\\nDaenerys orders Drogo brought into her tent. She bathes him herself and washes his hair until darkness falls. She\\nthinks of their first ride beneath the open sky and of when they made \\nRhaego\\n. She is too raw from the miscarriage\\nfor intercourse, but uses other means in an attempt to use the magic of love to bring Drogo back. It does not work\\nand her husband remains comatose. When dawn breaks, Daenerys kisses Drogo for the last time, and then smothers\\nhim with a soft silk pillow.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys VIII\\n↑\\nSansa VI\\n ←\\nDaenerys IX\\n→ \\nTyrion IX\\n↓\\nDaenerys X\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 69: Tyrion IX\\nPlace(s): \\nCrossroads Inn\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VIII\\n↑\\nDaenerys IX\\n ←\\nTyrion IX\\n→ \\nJon IX\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nTyrion I\\nNews of \\nRobb Stark\\n’s \\nvictory\\n at \\nRiverrun\\n prompts vigorous debate among the \\nLannister\\n officers. After dismissing\\nthe officers, Lord \\nTywin\\n details their precarious position to \\nTyrion\\n and dispatches him to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n to serve as\\nacting \\nHand of the King\\n and keep \\nJoffrey\\n from ruining them all. In spite of his father’s direct command, Tyrion\\nintends to bring \\nShae\\n with him.\\nSynopsis\\nThe army has just returned to the \\ninn at the crossroads\\n when a messenger arrives with word of Ser \\nJaime Lannister\\n’s\\ncapture\\n and the \\ndefeat\\n of his army at \\nRiverrun\\n. Lord \\nTywin\\n is upset that the \\nStarks\\n have his son. The news makes\\nTyrion\\n think back on their grueling countermarch. After realizing that \\nRobb Stark\\n had split his forces, Lord Tywin\\nset a grueling pace back toward the \\nTrident\\n in an attempt to reach Riverrun before the Starks. They left the bodies of\\nthe weak and the wounded in their wake every day and it was all for nothing; Robb Stark has beaten them there by\\nmany days.\\nSer \\nHarys Swyft\\n bemoans Jaime’s decision to split his army into three camps, but Ser \\nKevan Lannister\\n explains\\ncalmly that Riverrun’s position at the fork of the \\nTumblestone\\n and the \\nRed Fork\\n forces any besieger to do just that,\\nplacing one army north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and one between the two rivers to the west.\\nJaime’s army had no warning. Few of their outriders returned and those who did had seen nothing. The blame for\\ntheir disappearance fell on a small raiding force commanded by \\nMarq Piper\\n and Jaime rode out personally to deal\\nwith them in the Whispering Wood and did not return. Robb’s force attacked the north camp first during the night.\\nThe Blackfish\\n led the attack, cutting down the sentries. When Lord \\nAndros Brax\\n saw that the northern camp was\\nunder attack, he led the men of the western camp across the Tumblestone in rafts to join the battle. However, the\\ncurrent pushed them downstream into range of the catapults of Riverrun. Many of the rafts were sunk or overturned\\nand Lord Brax was drowned by his heavy plate armor. Those few who reached the far bank found the enemy waiting\\nfor them. Ser \\nFlement Brax\\n, Lord Brax’s son, is disquieted to hear of the death of his father.\\nThe camp between the rivers was overwhelmed as well. While Lord Brax was attempting to cross, two columns of\\narmored horse swept in from the west led by Robb Stark himself with his \\ndirewolf\\n at his side. A few \\nLannister\\npikemen managed to hold against the first charge, but Lord \\nTytos Blackwood\\n led a sortie from Riverrun to take\\nthem from the rear. \\nGreatjon Umber\\n fired the siege towers and Lord Blackwood liberated the prisoners, including\\nSer \\nEdmure Tully\\n.\\nThe south camp, under the command of Ser \\nForley Prester\\n, was able to retreat in good order back toward the \\nGolden\\nTooth\\n with 2,000 spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi \\nsellswords\\n in his camp struck their banners and went\\nover to the enemy. Kevan curses Jaime for not heeding his warning about mercenaries.\\nSer Harys exclaims that all is lost. Jaime’s host is all destroyed or put to flight and the Starks and \\nTullys\\n now stand\\nastride their supply lines, cutting Lord Tywin’s host off from their supplies and their \\nhomeland\\n. Robb Stark can even\\nmarch on \\nCasterly Rock\\n if he wishes. Ser Harys insists that they must sue for peace. At that, Tyrion shatters his wine\\ncup against a wall, declaring that Ser Harys will have better luck drinking from his broken cup than making peace\\n\\nwith Robb Stark now that \\nJoffrey\\n has beheaded \\nEddard Stark\\n.\\nSer \\nAddam Marbrand\\n insists that two battles do not make a war, while Lord \\nLeo Lefford\\n suggests a truce and an\\nexchange of prisoners. Tyrion only scoffs that the Starks hold far more prisoners than they do and that Eddard\\nStark’s head will not get his brother Jaime back; Robb is winning. When Lefford mentions that they hold Robb’s\\nsisters, Marbrand states that only an utter fool would exchange two girls for Jaime. Tyrion also shoots down\\nLefford’s suggestion of a monetary ransom, declaring that the Starks can melt Jaime’s armor if they need gold. Ser\\nHarys then suggests that they get their friends in the court to join them and to raise a new host at Casterly Rock.\\nLord Tywin has been even quieter than usual. After reiterating that they have his son, Tywin orders everyone but\\nTyrion and Kevan out.\\nTyrion is going to ask for wine but his father gives him his, untouched. Lord Tywin tells Tyrion that he was right\\nabout Eddard Stark: alive, Eddard could have been used to bargain a peace and buy time to deal with \\nRobert’s\\nbrothers. Tywin states the execution was madness and rebuffs Tyrion’s attempt to excuse Joffrey for his youth,\\nthough at least Joffrey did not marry a \\nwhore\\n.\\nLord Tywin explains that \\nVarys\\n has heard reports that \\nRenly Baratheon\\n has wed \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n and declared\\nhimself king, with all the might of \\nHighgarden\\n and \\nStorm\\'s End\\n behind him. Lord Tywin also informs them that\\nCersei\\n has commanded him to march to defend \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n. Tyrion can tell that Tywin is not happy about being\\ncommanded. Cersei has not told Joffrey of Renly’s claim, fearing her son will insist on leading the \\nCity Watch\\nagainst Renly and leave the city undefended against \\nStannis Baratheon\\n. Lord Tywin admits that, from the beginning,\\nhe has considered Stannis the most dangerous, and yet the Lord of \\nDragonstone\\n has done nothing; Varys has only\\nheard whisperings that Stannis is building a fleet, hiring sellswords, and seeking the counsel of a \\nshadowbinder\\n from\\nAsshai\\n.\\nTywin then details their position on a map. With Jaime’s defeat, they are in a bad situation: \\nRoose Bolton\\n’s\\nremnants are to the north, enemies hold the \\nTwins\\n and \\nMoat Cailin\\n, and Robb Stark is to the west so they cannot\\nretreat to \\nLannisport\\n without giving battle, while Jaime’s army has ceased to exist and \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n and \\nThoros\\nof Myr\\n plague their foraging parties. Then there are Dragonstone, Storm’s End, and Highgarden to the south calling\\ntheir banners. Tyrion’s jest that at least \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n is still dead goes unappreciated. If they remain where\\nthey are they might get caught between three armies. Tywin explains that he plans to go to \\nHarrenhal\\n to confront\\nRobb Stark. Ser \\nAddam Marbrand\\n will screen their movements, while \\nGregor Clegane\\n, \\nVargo Hoat\\n, and Ser \\nAmory\\nLorch\\n with 300 men each will set fire to the \\nriverlands\\n south of the Red Fork.\\nOnce Ser Kevan leaves to issue the orders, Lord Tywin offers to let Tyrion’s \\nclansmen\\n ride with Vargo Hoat, but\\nTyrion wishes to keep them close. Lord Tywin insists that Tyrion must learn to control them then, because he will\\nnot have King’s Landing pillaged. Tyrion does not understand until his father explains that he is sending him to\\ncourt to act as \\nHand of the King\\n and clean up the mess Cersei and the \\nsmall council\\n have created. Lord Tywin goes\\non to rant about the raising of \\nJanos Slynt\\n, the dishonoring of Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n--who lent honor to any man he\\nserved--and the appointment of \\nthe Hound\\n to the \\nKingsguard\\n. He also tasks Tyrion with bringing Joffrey under\\ncontrol if Cersei continues to fail and gives instructions to execute any councilors who play Tyrion false. When\\nTyrion asks why ‘‘he’’ is being sent, Tywin states it is because Tyrion is his son; Tyrion, however, thinks it is\\nbecause Tywin has given up Jaime for lost. As he leaves, Tywin commands that Tyrion is not to take \\nhis whore\\n to\\ncourt.\\nTyrion sits for a long while in the common room before going to his bed with Shae and whispering that he is of a\\nmind to take her to King’s Landing.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VIII\\n↑\\nDaenerys IX\\n ←\\nTyrion IX\\n→ \\nJon IX\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nTyrion I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 70: Jon IX\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n- \\nMole\\'s Town\\n and areas to the south of it\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon VIII\\n↑\\nTyrion IX\\n ←\\nJon IX\\n→ \\nCatelyn XI\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nJon I\\nJon\\n deserts in the middle of the night, determined to join his brother \\nRobb\\n in the quest for vengeance. South of\\nMole\\'s Town\\n, his friends catch up and bring him back. In the morning, \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n reveals he knows\\nabout the night’s events and convinces Jon to stay and join him on a \\ngreat ranging\\n \\nbeyond the Wall\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nLate at night, \\nJon\\n saddles a mare in the stables of \\nCastle Black\\n. As he mounts up, \\nSam\\n appears in the doorway,\\ninsisting that Jon cannot do this. Jon warns Sam to get out of his way since he does not want to hurt him. When the\\nfat boy refuses, Jon spurs his horse and forces Sam to leap out of the way, stumbling and falling. The mare leaps\\nover Sam. As he heads south down the \\nkingsroad\\n, Jon hopes that Sam has not hurt himself getting out of the way.\\nThe whole castle is silent and there is no one to see him leave; all the sentries are atop \\nthe Wall\\n, looking north. Jon\\ntrusts that Sam loves him enough to give him a head start. In truth, he does not believe the timid boy can summon\\nthe courage to disturb the guards to wake the \\nLord Commander\\n in the night. As he rides, Jon flexes his burnt hand,\\nappreciating having the bandages off.\\nJon stays on the kingsroad in the moonlight, knowing that he must get as far from Castle Black as he can before\\ndawn, planning to then go overland to confuse the pursuit. When he fails to bring the Lord Commander’s breakfast\\nat dawn they will search his cell, discover \\nLongclaw\\n, and know he has deserted. It was hard to leave the sword, but\\nin the end Jon followed \\nJorah Mormont\\n’s example. The thought of betraying old \\nJeor Mormont\\n’s trust bothers Jon,\\nbut it cannot be helped. Jon is still not sure he is doing the honorable thing. Jon thinks that the southerners have it\\neasier; they can talk to their \\nseptons\\n to help sort out right from wrong whereas the \\nheart trees\\n do not talk.\\nOnce out of sight of Castle Black, Jon slows his pace to spare the horse. He hopes to trade her for a new one and\\ncannot do that if she is injured or blown. He will also require an entire set of new clothes; his black wool, leather,\\nand steel will draw the suspicions of everyone north of \\nthe Neck\\n. Once Maester \\nAemon\\n\\'s ravens take flight, not even\\nWinterfell\\n will offer refuge to him.\\nYet fond memories of Winterfell are not why Jon has forsaken his vows. He is \\nhis father\\n’s son and \\nRobb\\n\\'s brother.\\nMaester \\nAemon\\n was right about the pain of choosing, but \\nTyrion Lannister\\n was also right about denying a hard\\ntruth. Jon is done with denying the truth. For the rest of his life, he will be accursed and outcast but it will be worth\\nit so long as he lives long enough to join Robb in avenging their father. Jon even envisions the moment he will\\nreveal himself to Robb. Yet those visions stall at Robb’s reaction, when Jon cannot picture his brother smiling. Jon’s\\nmind flashes to the deserter that their father beheaded and to what his father told the deserter about vows. He\\nwonders what his father’s reaction might have been if that deserter had been his brother \\nBenjen\\n; he thinks it must be\\ndifferent. The thought of being rejected and executed does not bear thinking about, so Jon begins riding harder\\nagain, as if to outrun his doubts. He does not fear death, but he does not want to die like that. He is not a true Stark\\nbut he can die like one; let them say there were four sons.\\nAs Jon approaches the lights of \\nMole\\'s Town\\n, \\nGhost\\n disappears, apparently to go hunting. Jon does not concern\\nhimself, knowing the \\ndirewolf\\n will follow at his own pace. Once he is well beyond the village, Jon stops to drink\\n\\nrunoff from the snow and finds his fingers ache worse than they have in days and he has a pounding headache. Since\\nhis horse is lathered, he walks. Jon still has not seen his wolf and it concerns him. He decides to eat a sparse meal to\\ngive Ghost a chance to catch up. As he is finishing, Jon hears horses coming from the north. Knowing they are too\\nclose to outrun, Jon quickly takes cover with the horse in a grove of \\nsentinel\\n trees off the road.\\nAs the riders ride up, Jon quickly recognizes the voices of the boys of his former training syndicate: \\nGrenn\\n, \\nPyp\\n,\\nToad\\n, \\nHalder\\n, and \\nMatthar\\n. Jon’s mare snorts, and Halder hears it as the others argue about where Jon might be, and\\nasks the others to be quiet. Jon realizes that Sam did not go to the Lord Commander but he did not go to sleep,\\neither. Jon is concerned that the other boys will be named deserters if they are not in their beds by dawn. Just as the\\nboys are about to pass him by, Ghost comes loping through the woods and spooks Jon’s horse, giving away his\\nposition.\\nJon first tries to flee but the boys are on him before he can. He draws his sword and attempts to frighten them into\\nbacking down, but the boys are unafraid. Jon demands to know what they want and they explain they are here to\\ntake him back where he belongs. Jon insists that he belongs with his brother Robb, but the others remind him that\\nthey\\n are his brothers now. Jon wonders why they cannot leave him in peace. They start reciting their vows, Jon\\ncursing them. Pyp moves his horse closer, and the others surround him. Pyp grabs the reins and tells Jon that he\\nmust either come back with them or kill them. Jon knows can easily kill them all, but agrees to go back, cursing\\nthem all. Ghost comes out of the trees and Jon glares at him, but Ghost’s eyes seem to have a knowing look. Pyp\\nnotes that they have to hurry because they must be back before first light, otherwise the Lord Commander will have\\nall their heads. They make it back an hour before dawn. To Jon it no longer seems like home and he decides he will\\nbide his time before his next attempt and avoid the kingsroad next time.\\nThe next morning as Jon is serving his breakfast, the Lord Commander reminds Jon of his comment that the things\\nmen love destroy them and that the hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Then he comments that Jon looks weary\\nand asks if his moonlight ride was exhausting. When Jon expresses his surprise, Mormont explains that Maester\\nAemon told him that Jon would leave, and that he told Aemon that Jon would come back. He adds that he knew\\nhonor would bring Jon back. Jon points out that his friends brought him back, but Mormont replies that he did not\\nsay it was Jon’s honor. He then tells Jon that he had a watch put over him, and that if his friends had not brought him\\nback, he would have been taken anyway.\\nJon thinks his life is forfeit and declares he is not afraid to die. Mormont says he hopes Jon is not afraid to live\\neither, pointing out that if they beheaded every man who rode to Mole’s Town for the night only ghosts would guard\\nthe Wall. Mormont also notes that Jon is plotting to desert again. When Jon keeps silent, Mormont asks if he thinks\\nhe can actually bring his father back to life or make any difference to Robb’s war; each of Robb’s bannermen\\ncommand more swords than the entire Night’s Watch.\\nMormont goes so far as to point out that his own sister, \\nMaege\\n, and her daughters rode south with Robb, but that his\\nplace is the Wall. Mormont asks where Jon believes his place is. Jon thinks that he has no place, no mother, and now\\nno father, but only says he does not know. Mormont says that he knows Jon’s place. The cold winds are rising:\\nCotter Pyke\\n’s men have reported \\nmammoths\\n and \\nhuge misshapen tracks\\n near \\nEastwatch\\n. \\nDenys Mallister\\n has\\nreported that the \\nwildlings\\n are abandoning their villages near the \\nShadow Tower\\n and \\nQhorin Halfhand\\n has taken a\\ncaptive who revealed that \\nMance Rayder\\n, the \\nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\\n, is massing his people in some secret\\nstronghold for an unknown purpose. Then the Lord Commander asks if Jon thinks his brother’s war is more\\nimportant than theirs is. He also asks Jon if he thinks it matters who sits the \\nIron Throne\\n when \\ndead men\\n come\\nhunting in the night. Jon has to agree; he has never thought of it that way before.\\nMormont goes on to say that he believes Jon and Ghost were meant to be here, because the blood of the \\nFirst Men\\n,\\nwho built the Wall, is strong in the \\nStarks\\n of Winterfell; they remember things other men have forgotten. In addition,\\nGhost led them to the two wights. Some men, like Ser \\nJaremy Rykker\\n, might call that happenstance, but Mormont\\nstresses that Ser Jaremy is dead and he is alive. He wants Jon and Ghost with him when they go \\nbeyond the Wall\\n; he\\nwants to find \\nBenjen Stark\\n, alive or dead.\\nWhen Jon asks what he means, Mormont declares that he will not sit meekly and wait for the snows to come. The\\nNight’s Watch will \\nride in force\\n against the wildlings, \\nthe Others\\n, and whatever else is out there. Mormont plans to\\ncommand them himself. He continues that the Lord Commander’s steward also serves as his squire, but he does not\\nwant to be looking over his shoulder. Therefore, he asks Jon:\\n\\nAre you a brother of the Night’s Watch or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?\\nJon pauses to apologize mentally to all his family before declaring that he is Mormont’s man and that he will not run\\nagain. Mormont expresses his approval and orders Jon to go put on \\nhis sword\\n again.\\nNavigation:\\nJon VIII\\n↑\\nTyrion IX\\n ←\\nJon IX\\n→ \\nCatelyn XI\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nJon I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 71: Catelyn XI\\nPlace(s): \\nRiverrun\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn X\\n↑\\nJon IX\\n ←\\nCatelyn XI\\n→ \\nDaenerys X\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nCatelyn I\\nCatelyn\\n returns to \\nRiverrun\\n for the first time in many years. After meeting with her ailing \\nfather\\n, she seeks out \\nRobb\\nin the \\ngodswood\\n. After praying with his bannermen, Robb calls a council to determine their next move. The council\\nargues for hours about which way to march and which king to support until \\nGreatjon Umber\\n gives a rousing speech\\nand the bannermen proclaim Robb the \\nKing in the North\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nTo \\nCatelyn\\n, it seems a thousand years since she left \\nRiverrun\\n by boat with an infant \\nRobb\\n to head north to \\nWinterfell\\nfor the first time. Now she is returning by boat across the \\nsame river\\n with a son who wears plate and mail instead of\\nswaddling clothes. With them in the boat is \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n, and in the boat following are \\nBrynden Tully\\n, \\nGreatjon\\nUmber\\n, and \\nRickard Karstark\\n.\\nAs they draw near, the men on the walls cheer them as the banners of \\nHouse Tully\\n fly from every rampart, but\\nCatelyn cannot feel anything but sadness since she received news of \\nher husband\\n’s death, and she wonders if her\\nheart will ever lift again. After passing under the wall through the wide Water Gate, they are greeted on the water\\nstair by Catelyn’s brother Ser \\nEdmure Tully\\n and Lord \\nTytos Blackwood\\n. A worn-looking Edmure embraces Catelyn,\\nexpresses his condolences, and promises vengeance against the \\nLannisters\\n. Catelyn only says that it will not bring\\nNed back, then states she has to see \\nher father\\n.\\nShe is escorted to her father’s solar in the keep, which is three-sided like Riverrun itself. Along the way, Catelyn\\nasks about her father, and--as expected--Edmure explains that he is dying. When Catelyn demands to know why she\\nwas not notified, Edmure explains that with the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n so volatile their father forbid it; if word had gotten\\nout that he was ailing, the Lannisters might have attacked. Catelyn immediately blames herself, remembering it was\\nshe who sparked the war by \\narresting\\n \\nTyrion Lannister\\n.\\nThe solar is also triangular with a balcony to the east from which the walls, battlements, and river fork can be seen.\\nLord Hoster’s bed has been moved onto the balcony so he can sit in the sun and watch the rivers. He is shrunken,\\nlooking much older and frailer than Catelyn remembers. Lord Hoster calls her “Little Cat” and tells how he wanted\\nto be awake when she arrived; he was afraid he would not wake again. He speaks weakly and is wracked by spasms\\nof pain. He defends his decision to keep news of his illness a secret, but admits that he was afraid he would die\\nbefore seeing her again, especially once the siege began. She tells him that Robb is here, they have \\nJaime Lannister\\nin irons, and Riverrun is free again. This leads Lord Hoster to tell her of the joy he had as he watched the \\nbattle\\n from\\nthe battlements.\\nHer father asks if it was Robb who won the battle and Catelyn tells him that it was. Then she mentions that Ser\\nBrynden was also an important figure. Lord Hoster seems surprised by the mention of the Blackfish and asks if \\nLysa\\nhas come down from the \\nVale\\n as well. Catelyn cannot lie and explains that Lysa is frightened and believes she and\\nher son are only safe in the \\nEyrie\\n. Hoster is very disappointed that he will not see her.\\nLord Hoster agrees to see Robb, who he remembers has his Tully eyes. When Catelyn presses on to ask if he will\\n\\nsee his brother, her father asks if Ser Brynden has married anyone yet. Catelyn is saddened that her father cannot\\nallow the old feud to rest. She tells him that his brother has not wed, nor will he ever. Lord Hoster launches into a\\nweak rant, criticizing Brynden’s choice to defy him and never marry, saying that \\nBethany Redwyne\\n is still waiting\\nfor Brynden. Catelyn has to remind her father that Bethany Redwyne has long ago married Lord \\nMathis Rowan\\n and\\nhas three children. Her father states there were also offers from others, including Lord \\nJonos Bracken\\n’s daughter or\\nany of three by \\nWalder Frey\\n. Catelyn tells how she would not have made it to Riverrun without Brynden, and her\\nfather agrees that he was always a warrior. Lord Hoster agrees to see his brother later but he is too tired to fight now.\\nHoster is asleep before Catelyn leaves the solar.\\nBrynden is talking with the Riverrun guards when Catelyn returns, but he anxiously asks about his brother, and\\nCatelyn confirms that he is dying. When Brynden asks if Hoster will see him, Catelyn conveys that he will but he is\\ntoo tired to fight. Ser Brynden only laughs that his brother will be chiding him about the Redwyne girl as they light\\nhis funeral pyre. Catelyn smiles and asks where she can find Robb.\\nIn the halls Catelyn finds Theon regaling the garrison an account of the battle and of how \\nGrey Wind\\n tore off a\\nman’s arm and drove the Lannister horses mad. When asked, Theon tells her that he believes Robb went to the\\ngodswood\\n. She realizes that this is just what Eddard would do after a battle.\\nCatelyn finds Robb praying with those of his lords bannermen who hold to the \\nold gods\\n, including the Greatjon,\\nRickard Karstark, \\nMaege Mormont\\n, \\nGalbart Glover\\n, and Lord Tytos Blackwood (one of a very few followers of the\\nold gods south of \\nthe Neck\\n). She feels she should not disturb their prayers. As she walks through the godswood,\\nmemories of her childhood beset Catelyn. Here her father taught her to ride, there Edmure fell and broke his arm,\\nand under that bower she and Lysa played at kissing with \\nPetyr Baelish\\n and he tried to tongue them with mint from\\nthe godswood on his breath. As Robb rises from his prayers, Catelyn wonders if Robb--who has ridden into battle\\nand killed men with a sword--has ever been kissed in the godswood.\\nWhen he sees her, Robb declares that they must call a council. Catelyn tries to get him to see his very sick\\ngrandfather, but Robb insists that first they must meet to discuss the news that \\nRenly Baratheon\\n has proclaimed\\nhimself king. Catelyn says she had expected it to be Lord \\nStannis\\n and Galbart Glover says they all did.\\nThe meeting is held in the great hall at four long tables. Lord Hoster is too weak to attend, but the attendance\\nincludes Edmure and the Blackfish with the Tully bannermen arrayed around them: Lord \\nJonos Bracken\\n, Lord \\nTytos\\nBlackwood\\n, Lord \\nJason Mallister\\n, Ser \\nMarq Piper\\n, Ser \\nStevron Frey\\n, \\nKaryl Vance\\n (a lord now, following his father’s\\ndeath), and Lord \\nLyman Darry\\n, son of Ser \\nRaymun Darry\\n. The smaller number of northern lords sits opposite: Robb,\\nTheon, Rickard Karstark (grief-stricken over the death of his two sons), Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and\\nGreatjon Umber.\\nThe lords argue late into the night with every lord taking full advantage of his right to speak. \\nRoose Bolton\\n has\\nreformed their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n has crossed the \\nTrident\\n and is making\\nfor \\nHarrenhal\\n. Some lords favor marching east to meet Lord Tywin at Harrenhal. Marq Piper favors marching west\\nto \\nCasterly Rock\\n. Jason Mallister suggests they simply stay athwart Lord Tywin’s supply lines and rest their troops.\\nJonos Bracken proposes they pledge fealty to Renly and move south to join him.\\nRobb, speaking for the first time, insists that Renly is not the king. The lords protest that Robb cannot mean to hold\\nto \\nJoffrey\\n, who executed his father. Robb insists that that makes Joffrey evil, but does not make Renly king; as the\\nyoungest brother, Renly cannot be king before Stannis. That splits the room again, with some favoring Stannis and\\nsome still favoring Renly who is crowned and has \\nHighgarden\\n and \\nStorm\\'s End\\n to support him. Robb states he does\\nnot know what to do since Joffrey is the true heir, but he executed \\nhis father\\n based on a lie. Ser \\nStevron Frey\\n, old\\nWalder Frey\\n’s heir, suggests that they make peace and allow Renly and Joffrey to fight and oppose or submit to the\\nwinner as they choose; Lord Tywin would welcome the truce and the return of his son. This is met with shouts of\\noutrage.\\nCatelyn suggests a peace. Robb reminds her that the Lannisters murdered her husband and that he will have no\\npeace with them, laying his sword on the table to emphasize his point. Catelyn points out that the war was started to\\nfree Eddard and to protect the Riverlands. The Riverlands are now safe and no amount of vengeance will bring her\\nhusband back. She wants her daughters safe, for Robb to be safe and ruling from \\nWinterfell\\n, and to go home. Ser\\nBrynden questions what the terms of peace could be that would prevent another war in the near future. Rickard\\n\\nKarstark and Jonos Bracken question what their sacrifices have been worth if peace is made now. Tytos Blackwood\\nnotes that if they make peace with King Joffrey, are they not traitors to King Renly? Catelyn’s hopes of peace\\nshatter before her eyes.\\nThe meeting breaks down into another argument of which king to support, until \\nthe Greatjon\\n rises to his feet and\\nsilences them all. He spits upon all the kings and declares that Renly and Stannis are nothing to him. He asks why\\nthey should rule over him and his from some flowery seat in the south when they know nothing about \\nthe North\\n.\\nEven their \\ngods\\n are wrong. The Greatjon asks why they should not rule themselves again. It was the \\ndragons\\n they\\nsubmitted to and the dragons are all dead. Then the immense man points his two-handed greatsword at Robb and\\nproclaims:\\nThere\\n sits the only king I mean to bend \\nmy\\n knee to, m’lords. The \\nKing in the North\\n!\\nThe other bannermen all take up the call, even the river lords who have never been ruled from Winterfell. And for\\nthe first time in 300 years, there is a King in the North.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn X\\n↑\\nJon IX\\n ←\\nCatelyn XI\\n→ \\nDaenerys X\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nCatelyn I\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 72: Daenerys X\\nPlace(s): \\nDothraki Sea\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys IX\\n↑\\nCatelyn XI\\n ←\\nDaenerys X\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nDaenerys I\\nDaenerys\\n builds a funeral pyre for \\nDrogo\\n and places her dragon eggs among his treasures. When she attempts to\\ntake control of the few remaining \\nDothraki\\n as a \\nkhal\\n would, she is refused. As night falls, Daenerys lights the pyre\\nand is drawn by instinct deep into the inferno. When the pyre dies, the others find her unburnt and nursing the first\\nthree baby \\ndragons\\n in hundreds of years.\\nSynopsis\\nDaenerys\\n and her \\nkhas\\n build a funeral pyre for \\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n, as is \\nDothraki\\n custom. There is little wood in the land so\\nmuch of what they find is gnarled. They lay the logs in a square and fill the center with brush, grass, and bark\\nshavings. \\nAggo\\n and \\nRakharo\\n kill a stallion from their now meager herd so that Drogo might have a mount in the\\nafterlife; it is nowhere near as fine as Drogo’s \\nred\\n, but there are few in the world that are. \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n believes\\nthat Daenerys is attempting to use bloodmagic to resurrect her \\nkhal\\n and insists that without the proper spells the\\nblood is nothing. The \\nmaegi\\n even goes so far as to offer assistance in exchange for being released from her bonds,\\nbut Daenerys orders her silenced. On the platform they pile Drogo\\'s treasures, but Daenerys does not let the weapons\\nshe received as bride gifts be added, insisting they are hers.\\nSer \\nJorah\\n is wary of her intentions, and pleads with her to let Drogo go and come with him to see the wonders of the\\neast. Daenerys assures him that she does not plan to sacrifice herself on her husband’s pyre. When Ser Jorah calls\\nher “princess”, Daenerys insists that he call her “queen”; her brother, the king, is dead and everything that was his is\\nnow hers.\\nOnce the pyre is completed, Daenerys gathers her people together, now fewer than a hundred, and declares that they\\nwill be her \\nkhalasar\\n. Among the crowd, she sees slaves and declares them free. She announces that any among them\\nare free to go, but that if they stay they shall always have an honored place among her \\nkhalasar\\n.\\nDaenerys turns to the three young warriors of her \\nkhas\\n and gives each of them one of her bride gifts, naming them\\nko\\n and asking for their oaths as her \\nbloodriders\\n: to \\nJhogo\\n she gives the silver-handled whip, to Aggo the double-\\ncurved black dragonbone bow, and to Rakharo the gold-chased \\narakh\\n. However, none of them are willing to take the\\noath: Jhogo replies that this is not done and it would shame him to be a woman\\'s bloodrider, Aggo states that only a\\nman can lead a \\nkhalasar\\n and name a \\nko\\n, and Rakharo only promises to take her to \\nVaes Dothrak\\n to join the \\ndosh\\nkhaleen\\n. Daenerys ignores the refusals. Finally, Daenerys turns to Ser Jorah and promises him a fine \\nValyrian steel\\nblade when she comes into her \\nbirthright\\n. Ser Jorah swears his fealty and heart to her and Daenerys proclaims him\\nthe first of her \\nQueensguard\\n.\\nDaenerys returns to her tent, knowing the Dothraki think her mad and not sure that they are wrong. After a\\npleasingly steaming hot bath, she is dried and perfumed. Daenerys sends her handmaids away so that she might\\nprepare Drogo for his final journey. She thinks about how few Dothraki men die with their hair uncut as she washes\\nhim, braids his hair with bells, and dresses him in fine clothes and the worn vest he liked most. She finally asks him\\nto forgive her, and declares that she paid the price, but it was too high. She then dresses in fine clothes with a vest\\nlike Drogo’s. The sun is setting when she calls them back to bear Drogo to the pyre.\\n\\nDaenerys orders oil poured over the pyre, and then orders her handmaidens to fetch her dragon eggs. Something in\\nher voice makes them run. Ser Jorah protests that Drogo will have no need of dragon eggs, urging Daenerys to sell\\nthem and live as a wealthy woman for the rest of her days. Daenerys insists that the eggs were not given to her to\\nsell. Daenerys climbs the pyre to place the black egg under Drogo\\'s arm, near his heart, the green beside his head,\\nand the cream-and-gold between his legs. Once the eggs are in place, Daenerys gives her love one last kiss.\\nClimbing down, Daenerys notices Mirri Maz Duur watching her and hears the \\nmaegi\\n call her mad. Daenerys only\\nasks how far madness is from wisdom and commands that Mirri Maz Duur be bound to the funeral pyre by Rakharo\\nand Ser Jorah, who hesitates and protests. The woman does not scream or plead as she is bound. As she pours the oil\\nover the \\nmaegi\\n’s head, Daenerys thanks her for all she has taught her. Mirri Maz Duur promises that Daenerys will\\nnot hear her scream. Daenerys insists that she will, but that she only wants the \\nmaegi\\n’s life, echoing the woman’s\\nown words: “Only death can pay for life.” This brings a flicker of what might be fear to \\nmaegi\\n’s face for the first\\ntime.\\nThey wait for night to fall. It is Jhogo that first notices the \\nred comet\\n, the first star of the evening. Daenerys sees this\\nas a sign to light the pyre. Mirri Maz Duur sings in a high, ululating voice at first, but her voice becomes a wail as\\nthe flames engulf her and she soon falls silent. The Dothraki and Ser Jorah back away as the smoke grows thicker\\nand the heat stronger, but Daenerys stands her ground; she is the blood of the dragon and undeterred by the fire. She\\nknew the truth long ago, but the brazier was not hot enough. Then Daenerys begins to slowly walk towards the fire\\nas sweat covers her body. She sees many images as she walks: trees, animals, and a great grey stallion. Seeing the\\nhorse she tells Drogo to mount, and for a second she sees him mounted. He smiles at her and cracks a whip made of\\nflame down upon the pyre and Daenerys hears the crack of breaking stone as the pyre collapses, showering her with\\nash, cinders, and broken egg shell. Behind her, she can hear the Dothraki and Ser Jorah shouting. As the pyre begins\\nto collapse completely, Daenerys hears two more cracks like the first and walks into the heart of the fire.\\nWhen the fire dies, Ser Jorah finds Daenerys, naked but alive and unburnt except for her hair, nursing two baby\\ndragons\\n, with a third draped across her shoulders. The dragons match the colors of their eggs: \\ncream-and-gold\\n,\\ngreen-and-bronze\\n, and \\nblack-and-scarlet\\n. Ser Jorah drops to his knees wordlessly. He is followed by Jhogo, Aggo,\\nand Rakharo who declare her blood of their blood, and then her handmaidens and the rest of the Dothraki do the\\nsame. Daenerys knows that they are now hers as they never were Drogo’s.\\nDaenerys rises and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night comes alive with the music of dragons.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys IX\\n↑\\nCatelyn XI\\n ←\\nDaenerys X\\n↓\\nA Clash of Kings\\nDaenerys I\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Prologue\\nPlace(s): \\nDragonstone\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nPrologue\\n→ \\nArya I\\nMaester \\nCressen\\n broods on the omens all around him on \\nDragonstone\\n. When news arrives that the \\nstorm lords\\n will\\nnot support \\nStannis Baratheon\\n’s quest for the \\nIron Throne\\n, Cressen comes into conflict with Queen \\nSelyse\\n and the\\nred priestess \\nMelisandre\\n over what course to take. In a desperate attempt to kill Melisandre, Cressen shares poison\\nwine with her, but dies while she remains unaffected.\\nSynopsis\\nMaester \\nCressen\\n watches from his balcony as the \\nred comet\\n spreads across the dawn over \\nDragonstone\\n like a wound\\nin the sky. The feeble 80-year-old chides himself for considering it an omen, yet he has never seen a comet so bright\\nnor of that color. It is even visible during the day now. At the same time, hot steam has begun to issue from vents\\nbeneath the Dragonmont volcano, and a \\nwhite raven\\n has arrived from the \\nCitadel\\n, declaring the end of the longest\\nsummer in living memory (10 years, two turns and 16 days); too many omens to deny. It is enough to make any man\\nbelieve in omens, but the old \\nmaester\\n cannot decide what they might mean.\\nCressen’s eventual successor Maester \\nPylos\\n interrupts his thoughts with word that Princess \\nShireen\\n wishes to see the\\nwhite raven. The title “princess” is a new appellation for the young girl, now that her father, \\nStannis Baratheon\\n, is a\\nking. Cressen bids Pylos to show her in. The shy princess enters, followed by her shuffling fool \\nPatchface\\n, who\\nwears a mock helm made from a bucket with antlers and cowbells. Perhaps once Patchface was a good fool, but now\\nhe has lost his wits and is incoherent as often as not. Only Shireen laughs at his antics or cares about him at all.\\nShireen’s face is unattractive even discounting the disfigurement from a bout of \\ngreyscale\\n that nearly claimed her\\nlife as an infant. Shireen asks to see the white raven, and the maester will not deny her since she has been denied too\\nmuch during her life of almost ten years. She is the saddest child the maester has ever known and he considers her\\nanother mark of his failures.\\nWhile Pylos goes to fetch the white raven, Cressen thinks how the solemn 25-year-old Pylos is not a good match for\\nDragonstone because grim places need lightening. However, a maester does not choose his post, and Cressen recalls\\ncoming to Dragonstone himself 12 years ago with his lord, though he never liked it here and never considered it\\nhome. Of late, when he wakes from restless nightmares of the \\nred woman\\n, Cressen often does not know where he is.\\nCressen asks Shireen why she is up so early. The girl explains that she had nightmares of dragons coming to eat her.\\nThe maester remembers that she has always had nightmares. Thinking of the many dragon-inspired statues and\\nbuildings of Dragonstone, Cressen attempts to comfort her by explaining that Dragonstone was once the\\nwesternmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of \\nValyria\\n. The dragon towers were created to make the fortress seem\\nmore formidable. He explains that the Valryians had long-forgotten ways of shaping stone and used them to make\\nthe thousands of stone dragons on the island. Shireen is unconvinced, telling him that the red woman says the thing\\nin the sky is dragon’s breath. Cressen explains that it is only a comet and will be gone soon.\\nShireen states that her mother says the white raven means it is not summer any more, and the maester confirms that\\nit is true. He then goes on to tell her about the white ravens, and how the Citadel has determined that summer is\\nover. Cressen says that it is hoped that there will be a warm autumn with bountiful harvests. He knows that a long\\nsummer is said to bring a long winter, but does not want to frighten the child. When she asks if it will snow, the\\nmaester says it will, but he prays it will not be for years yet. Then, Pylos returns with the white raven, and the\\nmaester introduces the raven to Shireen. Shireen is delighted to learn that it can speak.\\nPatchface begins to sing, “The shadows came to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,” hopping from one\\nfoot to the other, “The shadows came to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord.” He jerks his head with each\\nword, and his bells make a clangor. Shireen declares that Patchface has been singing that song often lately and it\\n\\nscares her. She asks the maester to make him stop. Cressen thinks back to how the old Lord \\nSteffon Baratheon\\n found\\nthe fool in \\nVolantis\\n while seeking a wife for \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n. Upon their return journey, within sight of \\nhome\\n,\\ntheir ship sank, killing everyone aboard. Patchface was washed up on the shore three days later, naked, cold, and\\nclammy. They took him for dead, but then he coughed up water and survived, albeit broken in mind and body,\\nhardly capable of speech let alone wit. Many suggested that it would be kindest for Cressen to let the mad boy die,\\nbut he refused, and now he wonders at that decision. Cressen assures Shireen that Patchface is just rambling and\\ndoes not comprehend any of what he says.\\nPylos, who went to fetch Cressen’s breakfast, returns to inform him that Ser \\nDavos Seaworth\\n returned during the\\nnight and has been with Stannis most of the night. Cressen complains that he should have been notified, as it is his\\nduty to advise the king. Asking pardons of Shireen, the old man has Pylos help him hobble with his bad hips to the\\nStone Drum, the main keep of Dragonstone. He passes windows from which he can see 3,000 men in the camp\\noutside the wall, and the anchorage filled with ships since no ship that has come within sight of Dragonstone has\\nbeen allowed to leave.\\nOnce inside the Stone Drum, Cressen leaves Pylos, stating he wants to see Stannis alone. As he ascends the stairs he\\nregrets leaving Pylos. He meets Ser Davos coming down the stairs. Davos reveals that his mission as envoy to the\\nStormlands\\n has been a failure. It is as Cressen warned: the lords sworn to \\nStorm\\'s End\\n have no love for Stannis and\\nwill not support his claim. Instead, they have joined with the lords of the \\nReach\\n in supporting Stannis’ younger\\nbrother, \\nRenly\\n.\\nNews of Renly claiming the crown leads Cressen to worry for the youngest \\nBaratheon\\n. When Ser Davos mentions\\nthat Renly has instituted a \\nnew Kingsguard\\n, Cressen recalls that Renly was always fond of games and rich bright\\nfabrics as a child. “Look at me, I’m a dragon,” and “Look at me, I’m a wizard,” the boy was always shouting.\\nCressen sees Renly’s bid to be king as no more than another game: “Look at me, I’m a king!”\\nCressen asks Davos if he could bring Stannis any hope, but Davos insists that the only hope he could bring would\\nhave been the false sort. This leads Cressen to recall that Ser Davos was once a notorious smuggler who sailed a\\nblack ship past a \\nRedwyne\\n blockade in the dead of night to deliver onions and salt fish to Stannis’ starving garrison\\nduring the \\nSiege of Storm\\'s End\\n. It allowed them to survive until Lord \\nEddard Stark\\n could lift the siege. Stannis\\nknighted Davos for his deed. However, as punishment for his past misdeeds, Stannis himself cut short all the fingers\\non Davos’ left hand save the thumb; Davos had insisted that Stannis do the cutting. Cressen realizes that a man like\\nthat would give no false hope to Stannis. Ser Davos declares that if Stannis marches on \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n now, as is\\nhis intent, with so small an army it will only be to die. Cressen responds that Davos has done all he can and that it is\\nnow his turn.\\nCressen finds Stannis in the top room of the keep, looking down at the \\nPainted Table\\n, which is shaped as a detailed\\nmap of the continent of \\nWesteros\\n. Stannis greets him with the statement that he knew Cressen would come even\\nwithout a summons. He says that Cressen is now old and needs his sleep, and that he would have learned what\\nDavos knew on his own anyway. Talk between the maester and the king quickly turns into a rant by Stannis about\\nhow the \\nBaratheon\\n birthright of Storm’s End, the Stormlands, and its income should have passed to him rather than\\nRenly when their brother \\nRobert\\n assumed the \\nIron Throne\\n. Stannis did not want Dragonstone, but when his brother\\ncommanded it, he occupied it and built his brother’s fleets. It is an old grievance made new by the fact that\\nDragonstone, ancient and strong though it is, commands the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords whose stony\\nisland holdings are too thinly occupied to supply the men that Stannis needs to seize his rightful throne.\\nCressen explains that Robert did him an injustice, but gave him lordship of Dragonstone because a man’s strength\\nwas needed to hold it and Renly was just a boy. Stannis declares that Renly is \\nstill\\n a boy, a thieving child who has\\nnever done anything to deserve the throne. Stannis wonders aloud why the gods inflicted him with brothers. Then he\\nasks about the advice Renly gets from his maester, but Cressen doubts that Renly would seek council; Renly is bold\\nand heedless, much like Robert.\\nWhen Stannis asks what he is to tell the few anxious bannermen he does command, Maester Cressen reminds him\\nthat \\nHouse Lannister\\n is his true enemy and suggests that he join with Renly to defeat them. Stannis flatly refuses.\\nCressen yields immediately and suggests a partnership with the new \\nKing in the North\\n, \\nRobb Stark\\n, who commands\\nall the power of \\nWinterfell\\n and \\nRiverrun\\n. Stannis again refuses, claiming that Robb is a green boy and another false\\nking that seeks to steal half of his kingdom. Cressen suggests that half a realm is better than none and that Robb may\\n\\neven submit in exchange for help in avenging his father, but Stannis remains adamant and launches into another rant\\nabout the slights he received at the hands of his brother Robert:\\n“Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, \\nRobert\\n loved him, to be sure. Loved\\nhim as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known\\nby the way he treated me. I held \\nStorm\\'s End\\n for him, watching good men starve while \\nMace Tyrell\\n and \\nPaxter\\nRedwyne\\n feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked \\nStark\\n, for lifting the siege\\nwhen we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name.\\nDid he ever take my hand and say, \\nWell done, brother, whatever should I do without you?\\n No, he blamed\\nme for letting \\nWillem Darry\\n steal away \\nViserys\\n and \\nthe babe\\n, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council\\nfor fifteen years, helping \\nJon Arryn\\n rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my\\nbrother name me his \\nHand\\n? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor.\\nAnd small good it did either of them.”\\nCressen then proposes a marriage pact between Shireen and young \\nRobert Arryn\\n. Stannis dismisses the possibility of\\nbringing the weak and sickly Robert to Dragonstone, as planned before Lord Arryn’s death, because \\nLysa Arryn\\n is\\nparanoid and hides him in the \\nEyrie\\n. Cressen urges him to send Shireen and her fool to the Eyrie instead—\\nDragonstone is a grim home for a child. Stannis now agrees that it is worth a try.\\nThen Stannis’ wife, Queen \\nSelyse\\n, arrives to argue that Stannis should not have to beg or bargain for help; they all\\nowe their allegiance to him as the true king. Queen Selyse has been entirely converted to the worship of the foreign\\ngod \\nR\\'hllor\\n by the red priestess \\nMelisandre\\n of \\nAsshai\\n. Stannis tells her he needs swords, and asks whether she has an\\narmy. She replies that \\nHouse Florent\\n can provide an army, but Stannis retorts that they can only provide 2,000 men,\\nand are too close to \\nHighgarden\\n. The queen proclaims that the \\ncomet\\n is an omen from the Lord of Light that He will\\naid Stannis in his conquest. Stannis, who does not share his wife’s newfound faith, questions how many men the\\nRed God will deliver him. Selyse insists that R’hllor will provide all the power of \\nHighgarden\\n and \\nStorm\\'s End\\n.\\nStannis reminds her that those men now support Renly. Selyse agrees, but suggests that if Renly should die, his\\narmy would join Stannis. She then notes that Melisandre has looked into the flames and seen Renly dead. Cressen is\\nhorrified by the notion and pleads that fratricide is evil. Stannis declares that he has heard Cressen’s advice and will\\nnow hear hers, and sends the aged maester away.\\nBy the time Cressen joins Pylos at the bottom of the steps, he can hardly stand erect, and needs to be helped back to\\nhis rooms. There, Cressen contemplates his options. He raised Robert, Stannis, and Renly after their father died, and\\ncannot watch one kill the other. He knows that everything Queen Selyse said has been preached to her by\\nMelisandre, the red priestess. It is she who must be silenced before she can convert King Stannis to her evil schemes\\nand spread her mad religion beyond Dragonstone.\\nTherefore, Cressen goes to a small workroom under the rookery stair and retrieves a small vial of purple crystals, a\\npoison known in Westeros only as \\nthe Strangler\\n. Dissolved in wine, one of the small crystals is enough to cause the\\nvictim\\'s throat muscles to constrict more tightly than any fist, making it impossible for the victim to breathe. Cressen\\nplans to put one in Lady Melisandre’s drink at the feast Stannis is holding for his bannermen tonight. He knows it is\\na dreadful thing he is planning, but surely the gods will forgive him. As he lays down for a nap, Cressen wonders if\\nthe comet is his, foreboding murder.\\nHours later, Cressen wakes to discover he has overslept and is late for the feast. He calls for Pylos, who should have\\nawoken him, but Pylos does not come, so he has to shout for the servants. As he crosses the long gallery, the comet\\noutside the windows looks malevolent to him, but he thinks he should not fear. When he enters the great hall, he\\nfinds Stannis and his bannermen have begun without him. As Cressen crosses the room, Patchface the fool lurches\\ninto him while singing the same song from the morning and they both fall to the floor. Face-to-face with Cressen,\\nthe fool says “Under the sea you fall up, I know, I know.”\\nCressen is too feeble to rise on his own, but fortunately strong hands lift him to his feet. When he turns to thank the\\nknight he believes helped him, he comes face-to-face with Lady Melisandre herself, clothed in red silk with red\\neyes. The red priestess mockingly advises him to mind his steps, intoning her religion\\'s prayer, “For the night is dark\\nand full of terrors.” Cressen insists that only children fear the dark. Melisandre gives him a riddle, “A clever fool\\nand a foolish wise man”, and places Patchface’s ridiculous antlered helm upon Cressen’s head, telling him “A crown\\nto match your chain, Lord Maester.” All around him, Cressen hears laughter. He removes the crown, fighting his\\n\\nrage. He tells her he needs no crown but truth, to which Melisandre replies that some truths are not taught in Old\\nTown.\\nWhen he reaches the high table, Cressen sees that Stannis has given his accustomed seat to Pylos. When questioned\\nwhy he did not wake him, Pylos blushes and states he was told to let Cressen rest and that Cressen was not needed\\nhere. Cressen looks at the gaudy knights and captains: aged and sour Lord \\nArdrian Celtigar\\n, handsome Lord\\nMonford Velaryon\\n, plump 14-year-old Lord \\nDuram Bar Emmon\\n, homely Ser \\nAxell Florent\\n, pious Lord \\nGuncer\\nSunglass\\n, and the Lysene captain \\nSalladhor Saan\\n. Only Ser Davos Seaworth is simply dressed. Melisandre sits to\\nStannis’ right, in the place of high honor. Of all the lords, only Davos will meet his gaze, with pity in his eyes.\\nStannis declares that Pylos will now assume all of Cressen\\'s duties, insisting that Cressen is too ill and confused to\\nbe of use to him any longer. Cressen cannot believe it is Stannis’s voice that states this. Cressen is heartbroken by\\nthe rejection, remembering how he was the one that loved Stannis as a boy, perhaps because Stannis was the one\\nwho was unloved. Cressen accepts and meekly pleads for some place at the table, though he still feels he belongs at\\nStannis’ side. Of all the assembled lords, only Ser Davos offers him a seat.\\nAs Patchface continues to caper about, Ser Davos comments that they should wear motley, since they are about\\nfool’s business: Melisandre has seen victory in her flames and so Stannis plans to press his claim, no matter the\\nnumbers. Cressen urges Stannis a final time to ally himself with Robb Stark or Lysa Arryn, but Queen Selyse insists\\nthat R’hllor is the only ally Stannis needs. Cressen replies that gods make uncertain allies, and here R\\'hllor has no\\npower. Melisandre tells him that if he believes that he should put Patchface’s crown back on, and Queen Selyse\\ncommands thus. Stannis grudgingly orders the fool to give the crown to Cressen. After the fool places the crown on\\nCressen’s head, Selyse suggests that Cressen sing. Stannis refuses and declares that Cressen has served him well.\\nSuddenly, Cressen sees the opportunity to poison Melisandre. He is close to Davos’ cup, which he takes and slips a\\ncrystal into. He is sure only Davos notices. Cressen proposes to Melisandre that they share a cup of wine to toast to\\nher god’s power. She agrees. Davos tries to stop him, but Cressen insists he is doing what he must for the sake of the\\nrealm and his lord’s soul. Before they drink, Melisandre gives him the opportunity to back out, but Cressen refuses.\\nMelisandre drinks most of the cup, leaving only a small amount for Cressen. Cressen pushes away his fear and\\ndrinks as well. The ruby at Melisandre’s throat glows as she insists that her god R’hllor does have power. Cressen\\ntries to reply, but his throat has already begun to constrict. Unaffected by the poison, Melisandre looks on with pity\\nas Cressen collapses and dies.\\nNavigation:\\nPrologue\\n→ \\nArya I\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 1: Arya I\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n - The \\nKingsroad\\n north of \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya V\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nPrologue\\n ←\\nArya I\\n→ \\nSansa I\\n↓\\nArya II\\nArya Stark\\n is travelling north with \\nYoren\\n of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n, disguised as a boy. When the orphan boy known as\\nHot Pie\\n tries to steal her sword “\\nNeedle\\n,” Arya beats him bloody. Yoren takes her aside for punishment and reveals\\nthat \\nher father\\n was supposed to be allowed to take the black, rather than be executed.\\nSynopsis\\nArya used to think her nickname of “Arya Horseface” was bad, until the orphan boy \\nLommy Greenhands\\n named her\\n“Lumpyhead” because of her lumpy, uneven haircut. Her head actually feels lumpy when she touches it.\\nWhen \\nYoren\\n dragged her into an alley after \\nher father\\n’s \\nexecution\\n, Arya was sure he meant to kill her. Instead, the\\nsmelly old \\nblack brother\\n had only cut her hair and promised to deliver her to her home at \\nWinterfell\\n when he and his\\nnew recruits pass by. However, Yoren insisted that she pretend to be an orphan boy named Arry because half of the\\nnew recruits would turn her over to Queen \\nCersei\\n quick as spit for a pardon and a few silvers, and the other half\\nwould do the same but rape her first. Yoren claimed it should not be too hard to pass as a boy; the hardest part would\\nbe passing her water in the woods alone.\\nThere are 30 of them; some of the recruits are orphan boys recruited with promises of food and clothing, but others\\nare criminals from the dungeons under the \\nRed Keep\\n. The most frightening are the three from the \\nblack cells\\n, whom\\nYoren keeps chained in the back of a wagon. The five wagons contain supplies for the Wall: hides, bars of pig iron,\\na cage of ravens, cloth, books, paper, ink, \\nsourleaf\\n, oil, medicine, and spices.\\nThe gates of \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n were easy to pass, just as Yoren claimed. The \\nLannister\\n guards were searching for the\\nhighborn daughter of the \\nHand of the King\\n, not a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Yoren called one of them by\\nname and they were waved through. As they were leaving, Arya wished that \\nBlackwater Rush\\n would rise and wash\\naway the city until she remembered \\nher sister\\n would be washed away, too. Instead, she decided to wish for\\nWinterfell.\\nYoren was wrong about passing water being the hardest part. The men ignore her, but the orphan boys Lommy\\nGreenhands and \\nHot Pie\\n take her silence to mean she is frightened, stupid, or deaf. Arya is two years younger and\\nquite a bit smaller than them. One morning, Lommy and Hot Pie begin questioning Arya about her sword, “\\nNeedle\\n,”\\nwondering where she got it. Hot Pie sarcastically suggests that maybe she was a squire, but Lommy disagrees and\\nargues that Needle is probably not even a real sword. Arya angrily shouts back that it is castle-forged steel, but this\\nonly gives rise to claims that she stole it. This angers Arya even more because Needle was a gift from her bastard\\nbrother \\nJon Snow\\n, and she will not let them call him a thief.\\nThen Hot Pie gets the idea that he can steal Needle from her and Lommy encourages him. Hot Pie’s declaration that\\nshe doesn’t even know how to use a sword takes Arya back to the stable boy she stabbed during her \\nescape\\n from the\\nRed Keep\\n, but she doesn\\'t mention the incident. The boys continue to mock her, saying that she is going to cry and\\nwet her pants.\\nThe Bull\\n—an older boy with shaggy black hair and a bull-motif helmet—tells them to let her be, but Hot Pie\\n\\ncontinues. Arya attempts to diffuse the situation by offering to surrender her wooden practice sword, but Hot Pie\\nthreatens to beat her up like he did another boy and reaches for Needle. Arya uses her practice sword to whack Hot\\nPie’s donkey. The animal bucks and throws Hot Pie to the ground. Arya dismounts and breaks his nose with her\\npractice sword before turning on Lommy, who cowers away in fear. The Bull shouts a warning and Arya turns to\\nface Hot Pie. The injured boy throws a rock at her, but Arya ducks and closes the distance to strike him again on the\\nhand, cheek, knee, and back of the head. Dazed and wounded, Hot Pie attempts to charge her, but Arya slips into a\\nWater Dancer\\n pose and stabs the boy in the groin.\\nBy the time Yoren pulls her off, Arya has hit Hot Pie a dozen more times and the boy’s pants are brown and smelly.\\nYoren drags her off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering. There he orders her to drop her breeches\\nand scream loudly, then whacks her several times with her own stick sword. Arya does not want to scream, but\\ncannot help it, and her thighs and cheeks are ablaze with pain.\\nWhen he is finished, Yoren tells her that if she ever uses her stick sword on one of her companions again she will\\nget twice what she gives. Yoren also explains that however much her punishment hurt, Hot Pie is feeling much\\nworse. He points out that Hot Pie and Lommy had no part in her father’s death and hitting them won’t bring him\\nback. Arya says she knows that. Yoren goes on to explain that he was set to leave when he received a message to\\nwait for Lord Eddard, who was supposed to be allowed to take the black, only something went queer. Arya blames\\nKing \\nJoffrey\\n and declares someone should kill him. Yoren replies that someone will, but not him and not her.\\nAfterward, Arya is unable to sit a donkey for several days, but Hot Pie is unable to do anything but lie in the back of\\na wagon for even longer and Lommy stays as far away from her as possible. The Bull points out that Lommy\\ntwitches whenever she looks at him now. Arya does not answer since it seems safer not to talk. That night, while\\nlooking up at the sky, the Bull calls the \\nred comet\\n the “Red Sword,” saying that it looks like a sword fresh from the\\nforge. Arya can see it as a sword as well, but to her it is her father’s greatsword \\nIce\\n, covered with her father’s blood\\nas it was after his head was cut off.\\nWhen she finally falls asleep, Arya dreams of Winterfell. She longs to see \\nher mother\\n, \\nRobb\\n, \\nBran\\n, and \\nRickon\\n, but\\nmore than anyone she misses her brother \\nJon\\n on the Wall. She wishes that somehow they could come to the Wall\\nbefore Winterfell, just so she could see Jon again.\\nNavigation:\\nArya V\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nPrologue\\n ←\\nArya I\\n→ \\nSansa I\\n↓\\nArya II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 2: Sansa I\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n - The \\nRed Keep\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa VI\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nArya I\\n ←\\nSansa I\\n→ \\nTyrion I\\n↓\\nSansa II\\nSansa Stark\\n attends the \\ntourney on King Joffrey\\'s name day\\n. After several poor contests, \\nJoffrey\\n becomes enraged\\nwhen Ser \\nDontos Hollard\\n arrives half naked and too drunk to compete. Sansa manages to convince Joffrey to make\\nDontos his new fool instead of executing him. Afterward, while Prince \\nTommen\\n is riding against a quintain, \\nTyrion\\nLannister\\n arrives to assume his position as acting \\nHand of the King\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa\\n is watching the long tail of the \\nred comet\\n from her tower window when Ser \\nArys Oakheart\\n arrives to escort\\nher to the \\ntourney on King Joffrey\\'s name day\\n. She asks him what it means. Ser Arys declares that it means glory to\\nher betrothed, King \\nJoffrey\\n; the gods have raised it as a banner in his honor, and the smallfolk have named it “King\\nJoffrey’s Comet”. Sansa is not so sure and replies that she has heard the servants call it the “Dragon’s Tail.” Ser\\nArys replies that Joffrey sits on \\nAegon the Dragon\\n’s \\nthrone\\n and crimson is the color of \\nHouse Lannister\\n, so it must\\nmean he will triumph over his enemies. Sansa wonders apprehensively if this is true, since her \\nmother\\n and \\nbrother\\nare among Joffrey’s enemies. Yet Joffrey is a \\nBaratheon\\n as much as a Lannister, so his comet should be gold.\\nSer Arys compliments Sansa on her gown, whose long sleeves hide the bruises given to her by Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n at\\nJoffrey’s command when he learned that her brother \\nRobb\\n had been proclaimed \\nKing in the North\\n. Of all the\\nKingsguard\\n, Ser Arys is always courteous to Sansa, and is her preferred escort since he is the only one who objects\\nto hitting her and never hits hard. The others all obey without question, except \\nSandor Clegane\\n, but Joffrey never\\ncommands the \\nHound\\n to hit her.\\nAs they walk, Sansa asks who will win the tourney. Ser Arys states he will, though there will be only 40 contestants,\\nand there is small honor in unhorsing green boys. Sansa muses that this will be very different from the magnificent\\nHand\\'s tourney\\n. With King \\nRobert\\n dead and three kings vying for power it is not surprising that Joffrey’s tourney\\nmust be held within the \\nRed Keep\\n. Sansa asks if Queen \\nCersei\\n will attend, but learns that the queen has urgent\\nbusiness with the \\nsmall council\\n. Ser Arys also mentions that Cersei is furious that \\nTywin Lannister\\n will not bring his\\narmy to the city as commanded.\\nThe pitiful crowd in the small outer bailey fills only half the seats. Most of the spectators are \\ngold cloaks\\n or wear the\\ncrimson of House Lannister. Only a few are nobility: grey-faced Lord \\nGyles Rosby\\n, Lady \\nTanda Stokeworth\\n with\\nher daughters \\nFalyse\\n and \\nLollys\\n, the exiled prince \\nJalabhar Xho\\n, and Lady \\nErmesande Hayford\\n, who is only a baby.\\nThe Hound announces Sansa’s arrival at the royal box. Princess \\nMyrcella\\n gives a shy nod, but Prince \\nTommen\\nexcitedly tells her that he is to ride in the tourney. Joffrey quickly interjects that Tommen will be riding against a\\nstraw quintain. After Ser Arys excuses himself, Joffrey studies Sansa and declares he is pleased she wore the stones\\nhe gave her. Sansa is relieved that Joffrey has chosen to play the gallant today.\\nOnce Sansa is seated, Joffrey informs her that the Beggar King \\nViserys Targaryen\\n is dead. Joffrey is amused by the\\nirony of a \\ndragon king\\n being \\nkilled\\n with a molten gold crown. He suggests that perhaps he will feed Sansa’s brother\\nRobb to wolves and boasts that he intends to challenge Robb to single combat. Sansa states that she would like to\\nsee that. Joffrey is suspicious of her meaning, so Sansa distracts him by asking if he will compete today. Joffrey\\n\\nresponds that his mother claims it would not be fitting for him to compete in his own tourney, otherwise he would be\\nchampion. When asked to concur, the Hound says, “Against this lot? Why not?” When Sansa asks the Hound if he\\nwill joust, the scarred man replies that it would not be worth the bother, since this is a tourney of gnats. Joffrey\\nsuggests he should make the Hound fight the champion to the death, but the Hound replies that Joffrey would only\\nbe one knight the poorer (and the Hound is not a knight).\\nWhen the trumpets sound, Joffrey takes Sansa’s hand, which repulses her, but she forces herself to be still.\\nIn the first joust, Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n of the Kingsguard defeats Ser \\nHobber Redwyne\\n on the second pass. The \\nRedwyne\\ntwins are hostages like Sansa, and she doubts they entered the tourney voluntarily. Joffrey is disappointed by the\\npoor show. Next, Ser \\nBalon Swann\\n faces the new-made squire \\nMorros Slynt\\n, who is having difficulty with his lance.\\nThe sight of \\nJanos Slynt\\n’s heir takes Sansa back to the day her father was beheaded; it was Janos Slynt who threw\\nher father down and held him while Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n swung the sword. Her prayer for Morros to embarrass himself is\\nanswered when the former commoner is violently unhorsed. Joffrey hoots in derision, telling Tommen that they\\npicked the wrong foe for him, Morros jousts worse than a quintain. Then it is Ser \\nHoras Redwyne\\n’s turn. He fares\\nbetter than his twin, unhorsing an old knight bedecked with silver griffins who makes a poor contest. Disgusted,\\nJoffrey declares this a feeble show. He is getting bored and his mood is darkening, which worries Sansa.\\nNext, Ser \\nDontos Hollard\\n is called to face the freerider \\nLothor Brune\\n. Brune takes his place, but Ser Dontos arrives\\ndrunk and half naked, struggling to catch and mount his horse. The audience all laugh at the drunken knight’s antics\\nexcept for Joffrey. Eventually, Dontos gives up trying to mount, sits down in the dirt, forfeits the match, and asks for\\nmore wine. Joffrey stands and shouts, “A cask from the cellars! I’ll see him drowned in it.”\\nWithout thinking, Sansa protests and is immediately shocked that she dared, given Joffrey’s mood. He turns on her,\\nfurious at being gainsaid, and Sansa struggles to make up a story that it is a curse to kill a man on one’s name day.\\nJoffrey does not believe her, but the Hound comes to her rescue by agree that, “What a man sows on his name day,\\nhe reaps throughout the year.” Joffrey reluctantly agree to have the fool killed on the morrow. Sansa seizes the\\nopportunity to suggest that Joffrey make Dontos wear motley and clown for him as a fool instead of executing him;\\nhe does not deserve the mercy of a quick death. Joffrey likes this idea and agrees. Ser Dontos thanks both Joffrey\\nand Sansa.\\nOnce Ser Dontos has been led away, the master of revels inquires whether he should summon a new opponent for\\nLothor Brune or proceed with the next tilt. Instead, Joffrey calls off the tourney in disgust, saying he would have\\nthem all put to death if it weren\\'t his name day. Tommen vehemently protests that he was supposed to ride against\\nthe quintain. An argument among the royal siblings ensues. When Myrcella finally points out that their mother\\nagreed, Joffrey mocks her for being childish, but Myrcella points out that they ’’are’’ children. The Hound,\\nlaughing, tells Joffrey that she has a point. Joffrey sullenly agrees.\\nTommen’s opponent is a child-sized quintain wearing a helmet with antlers. Tommen hits it solidly, but it spins\\naround to strike Tommen on the back of the head, unhorsing him. This incites a gale of laughter from the crowd,\\nmost of all from King Joffrey. Princess Myrcella rushes out to help her brother to his feet. Sansa, with queer\\ncourage, suggests that Joffrey should accompany her to help and tell Tommen he rode well. Joffrey angrily refuses,\\nstating that getting unhorsed is not riding well. However, Tommen shows courage when he prepares to try again.\\nSansa finds herself wishing that Tommen was the eldest child; she wouldn’t mind marrying him.\\nJust then, the portcullis rises and the gates of the Red Keep open. A column of dusty horsemen enter under the\\ngolden lion banner of House Lannister. Some of the horsemen wear the armor of Lannister men-at-arms but the\\nmajority are freeriders, sellswords, and \\nmonstrous savages\\n. In their midst rides \\nTyrion Lannister\\n, the ugliest man\\nSansa has ever set eyes upon. Tommen and Myrcella rush to greet their uncle and Sansa is stunned to see that\\nTommen and Tyrion are the same height.\\nAfter greeting his niece and nephew, the dwarf waddles over to Joffrey, shadowed by a \\nblack-haired sellsword\\n and a\\none-eyed savage\\n. When Tyrion greets him, Joffrey expresses surprise at Tyrion’s arrival and the Hound comments\\nthat they heard Tyrion was dead. Myrcella expresses happiness that he is alive. Tyrion thanks her and then gives his\\ncondolences to Joffrey and Sansa for the loss of their fathers. Sansa is speechless, wondering if Tyrion is mocking\\nher. Joffrey is momentarily confused until Tyrion reminds him that his own father, King Robert, has also recently\\ndied. Joffrey responds “Oh, him. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.” Tyrion asks him if that is what ‘they’ say.\\n\\nSansa, armoring herself in courtesy, apologizes to Tyrion for his \\nabduction\\n by her mother. Tyrion thanks Sansa for\\nthe sentiment, telling her that many people are sorry, and some will be even sorrier.\\nThen, Tyrion asks Joffrey where he might find Queen Cersei. Joffrey answers that she is with the small council;\\nJaime Lannister\\n keeps losing battles and was captured, \\nRiverrun\\n was lost, and Robb is calling himself king. Tyrion\\ncomments that all sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days. Suspicious of the comment, Joffrey tells\\nTyrion stiffly that he is happy he is alive, and asks about a gift for his name day. Tyrion responds that he has brought\\nhis wits, and Joffrey replies he would prefer Robb’s head. Before Joffrey departs with Myrcella and Tommen, the\\nHound tells Tyrion to guard his tongue. Sansa is left alone with Tyrion and his monsters.\\nUnable to think of anything else to say, Sansa comments on Tyrion\\'s injured arm. Tyrion tells her that a northman\\nhit him with a morning star, but he escaped by falling off his horse. Tyrion asks if it is mourning for her father that\\nmakes Sansa so sad. Sansa reflexively insists that her father, mother, and brother are traitors and that she is loyal to\\nher beloved Joffrey. Tyrion is unconvinced and responds by comparing her to a deer surrounded by wolves. Sansa,\\nwithout thinking, whispers “Lions.” The dwarf gently takes her hand and assures her that he is only a little lion and\\nmeans her no harm, then departs.\\nSansa notes that Tyrion speaks to her more gently than Joffrey, but then she remembers that Queen Cersei once\\nspoke gently as well. She reminds herself that Tyrion is still a Lannister and that she must never trust a Lannister\\nagain.\\nNavigation:\\nSansa VI\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nArya I\\n ←\\nSansa I\\n→ \\nTyrion I\\n↓\\nSansa II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 3: Tyrion I\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n - The \\nRed Keep\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion IX\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nSansa I\\n ←\\nTyrion I\\n→ \\nBran 1\\n↓\\nTyrion II\\nTyrion Lannister\\n meets with the \\nsmall council\\n and assumes his position as acting \\nHand of the King\\n. After dismissing\\nthe council, he and Cersei discuss all that has happened in King’s Landing, and Cersei grudgingly accepts him as\\nHand. Later, Tyrion travels to the \\nBroken Anvil\\n, where he has finds \\nVarys\\n has already discovered his mistress \\nShae\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nOutside the \\nsmall council\\n chamber, Ser \\nMandon Moore\\n insists that Queen \\nCersei\\n has left orders not to be disturbed.\\nTyrion\\n quips that he will only be a small disturbance and produces his letter from Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n. Ser\\nMandon remains unimpressed and expressionless, a trait which makes \\nJaime Lannister\\n consider him the most\\ndangerous of the \\nKingsguard\\n (besides himself), since his face never hints at his next action. Refusing to back down\\non his first day, Tyrion introduces \\nBronn\\n and \\nTimett\\n. After Ser Mandon learns that Bronn \\nkilled\\n Ser \\nVardis Egen\\n, he\\nallows Tyrion to enter. Tyrion relishes that he has passed his first test.\\nWhen Cersei sees him, she exclaims “You!” with equal parts disbelief and distaste. Taking care to act confident in\\nfront of her, Tyrion remarks that he can see where \\nJoffrey\\n learned his courtesies. When Cersei asks why he is there,\\nTyrion saunters over to deliver their lord father’s letter. \\nVarys\\n inspects the seal and proclaims it genuine before\\nCersei snatches it. Cersei has taken the king’s seat, so Tyrion takes the Hand’s chair, which seems only appropriate.\\nCersei declares the letter absurd and explains that her father has authorized Tyrion to act as \\nHand of the King\\n in his\\nabsence.\\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n offers greetings, and Lord \\nJanos Slynt\\n declares that there is need of Tyrion with rioting in the\\nstreets and a \\ngrim omen\\n in the sky. Cersei lashes out that Slynt is the one in charge of keeping order and that Tyrion\\nwould serve them better on the battlefield. Tyrion replies that he is done with fighting, preferring the finer things in\\nlife. \\nLittlefinger\\n declares Tyrion a man after his own heart, which reminds Tyrion that he must have a talk with\\nLittlefinger about a certain dagger used in an \\nattempt\\n on \\nBran Stark\\n’s life.\\nCersei is not happy to learn that Tyrion has brought only a few hundred men; she is worried that \\nStannis\\n or \\nRenly\\nBaratheon\\n will attack the city. Then she declares that only the king can name a Hand, and Joffrey has named Lord\\nTywin. Tyrion points out that Lord Tywin named him and recommends that Cersei take it up with him at \\nHarrenhal\\n.\\nTyrion requests a private moment with Cersei, and the other councillors excuse themselves. As he leaves,\\nLittlefinger asks about living arrangements. Tyrion says he plans to take up residence in the \\nTower of the Hand\\n.\\nLittlefinger declares Tyrion a braver man than him, considering the fate of the last two Hands. Tyrion corrects this to\\nfour, explaining that \\nAerys\\n\\'s \\nlast Hand\\n died in the \\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n, and \\nthe one before him\\n was burned to\\ndeath. The two before them were luckier in that they merely died penniless in exile. Littlefinger japes that in that\\ncase he would sooner bed down in the dungeon than the Tower of the Hand, and Tyrion privately thinks that\\nLittlefinger might get that wish.\\nOnce they are alone, Cersei asks why their father would ignore her royal command and inflict Tyrion on her. Tyrion\\npoints out that Lord Tywin has a large army and can do that, nor is he the first to do so. Cersei threatens to call the\\nletter a forgery and throw Tyrion in a dungeon. Tyrion agrees that no one—not even their father—would protest, but\\n\\nasks why Cersei would want to do such a thing when he has come to help. Cersei insists that it was their father’s\\nhelp she wanted, but Tyrion can tell that it is Jaime she really wants, so he promises that if she supports him he will\\nfind a way to free Jaime. Cersei asks how, given that \\nRobb\\n and \\nCatelyn\\n \\nStark\\n are not likely to forget the beheading\\nof Lord \\nEddard\\n. Tyrion notes that Cersei still holds the Stark daughters, forcing Cersei to reveal that she only has\\nSansa\\n; she sent Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n to apprehend \\nArya\\n, but her \\ndancing master\\n interfered and the girl escaped and is\\nlikely dead.\\nTyrion asks Cersei if she trusts the small council, since their father does not; Joffrey’s short reign has been full of\\nfollies and disasters, which suggests the king is getting some very bad counsel. Cersei concedes that Joffrey, always\\nwillful, now believes that as king he is free to do as he pleases, not as he is bid. She explains that Joffrey was\\ninstructed to allow Eddard Stark to \\ntake the black\\n but took it upon himself to order Eddard killed, and Janos Slynt\\nand Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n were quick to take the command. Cersei also mentions that as a result, the \\nHigh Septon\\n is\\naccusing them of lying to him and profaning the \\nGreat Sept of Baelor\\n.\\nTyrion then questions Cersei about Slynt, asking whose idea it was to make him Lord of Harrenhal and a member of\\nthe small council. Cersei replies that Littlefinger made the arrangements; they needed the \\ngold cloaks\\n on their side to\\nstop Eddard Stark before he handed the throne over to Stannis Baratheon. Cersei adds that it was close even so; all\\nmight have been lost if Sansa had not come to Cersei with her father’s plans. Tyrion expresses surprise that Sansa\\nwould betray her own father\\'s plans, but Cersei explains that the girl was in love with Joffrey and would have done\\nanything for him right up until he cut her father\\'s head off and called it \"mercy\".\\nTyrion also learns it was Varys who suggested Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n be removed as \\nLord Commander of the\\nKingsguard\\n when Joffrey wanted to blame someone for \\nRobert\\n’s death. It freed the Lord Commander\\'s post and\\ncouncil seat for Jaime, and allowed Joffrey to throw a bone to \\nthe Hound\\n. A generous severance was provided, but\\nSelmy would have none of it and fled the city. Tyrion notes that he heard Selmy slew the two gold cloaks sent to\\napprehend him, which Cersei blames on Slynt’s incompetence. Tyrion points out that Barristan the Bold is a living\\nlegend who lends credibility to any man he serves. Cersei admits she did not think of that. Tyrion points out that\\ntheir father did, and that is why he sent Tyrion to bring Joffrey to heel.\\nCersei argues that Joffrey will be no more tractable for Tyrion, but Tyrion points out that Joffrey might be more\\ninclined to listen if he feels threatened, something he doesn’t feel with her. Cersei insists that she will never let\\nTyrion harm her son, but Tyrion assures her that he only means to threaten. Cersei admits it is worth a try, but\\nremains adamant that Tyrion do nothing without her consent. Tyrion agrees, then asks for an honest answer to who\\nkilled \\nJon Arryn\\n. Cersei tells him she does not know, and goes on to say that Eddard Stark asked her the same\\nquestion and hinted that Jon Arryn suspected her of something she hesitates to mention. Tyrion earns a slap in the\\nface when he reveals that he knew about her incest with Jaime all along. Tyrion insist that he is not as blind as their\\nfather and makes several rude comments that earn him more slaps until he finally warns her that he is getting angry.\\nTyrion asks how King \\nRobert\\n was killed, and Cersei explains that \\nLancel Lannister\\n gave him strongwine of three\\ntimes the normal potency before he faced the boar, which Cersei claims tasted like triumph when it was served at\\nRobert’s funeral feast. Tyrion, who rather liked King Robert, comments that Cersei was born to be a widow as he\\nrises to leave. Cersei objects that she has not excused him and presses for details about how he will free Jaime.\\nTyrion tells her he does not know yet, but reminds her to make sure no harm comes to Sansa.\\nOutside, Timett has disappeared to explore the city, so Tyrion commands Bronn to find him and make arrangements\\nfor the \\nclansmen\\n in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion commands \\nVylarr\\n, the captain of Cersei’s\\nhousehold guard, to provide an escort for him to the \\nBroken Anvil Inn\\n, hoping to remind the captain that his oath is\\nto \\nCasterly Rock\\n and not to Cersei alone. As he leaves the \\nRed Keep\\n, Tyrion orders the spiked heads of Eddard\\nStark and his household taken down and given to the \\nsilent sisters\\n. When Vylarr hesitates because King Joffrey\\nordered them to remain, Tyrion warns him that if they are not removed one of the spikes will have his head.\\nAs they ride through the city, Tyrion notices the effect \\nthe war\\n is having on the common people. The markets are\\nfull of ragged men selling their household goods, but bare of farmers selling food. There are guards at every shop,\\nand Tyrion notes that in lean times even bakers find sellswords cheaper than bread. Vylarr confirms that very little\\nfood is coming into the city with the roads closed to south and west. Tyrion asks what Cersei has done, and is told\\nshe has tripled the City Watch and has thousands of craftsmen working on the defenses, including the \\nAlchemists\\'\\nGuild\\n which has pledged ten thousand jars of \\nwildfire\\n. The thought of so much wildfire makes Tyrion\\n\\nuncomfortable, and he asks where the money is coming from, given that Robert beggared the realm. Vylarr explains\\nthat Littlefinger has introduced a tax on entering the city. Tyrion considers this clever and cruel, since tens of\\nthousands are fleeing the war for the supposed safety of the capital. When they arrive at the inn, he dismisses Vylarr\\nand says he plans to stay the night.\\nInside, Tyrion finds \\nShae\\n sitting with several \\nBlack Ears\\n and Varys. Tyrion is irritated that Varys found Shae so\\nquickly and wonders who might have betrayed him. Varys says that he had a sudden urge to meet Tyrion’s young\\nlady and Tyrion realizes that the eunuch is indirectly threatening him. The two exchange some veiled threats before\\nVarys asks if Tyrion has seen the red comet. Tyrion replies that he is short, not blind; on the \\nkingsroad\\n it seemed to\\ncover half the sky and outshone the moon. Varys tells Tyrion that on the streets it is called the Red Messenger, \"a\\nherald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.” Before Varys leaves, he poses a riddle to Tyrion:\\nIn a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a\\nlittle man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it’ says\\nthe king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do\\nit’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me-who lives and who dies?”\\nOnce Varys is gone, Shae asks if it is the rich man who lives. Tyrion is not so sure, saying it depends on the\\nsellsword. As they climb the stairs to their room, Shae has to wait for Tyrion. Tyrion notes that he still has to look\\nup to her even though she is only five feet tall, but he does not mind since she is so sweet. Shae quickly strips and\\nthen teases Tyrion that without her he will never be able to sleep in the Tower of the Hand without masturbating,\\nand asks if that is why they call it the Tower of the Hand. She drags him to the bed, and they make fierce love.\\nAfterwards, Tyrion calls himself a fool; Shae is a whore and only after his coin. When Shae asks what Tyrion will\\ndo as Hand of the King, he tells her, “Something Cersei will never expect. I’ll do... justice.”\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion IX\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nSansa I\\n ←\\nTyrion I\\n→ \\nBran 1\\n↓\\nTyrion II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 4: Bran I\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran VII\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nTyrion I\\n ←\\nBran I\\n→ \\nArya II\\n↓\\nBran II\\nPrince \\nBran Stark\\n contemplates the \\nred comet\\n and listens to the \\ndirewolves\\n howling in \\nWinterfell\\n, wondering about\\nthe reasons behind it all. He resents his broken body and the arrival of \\nBig Walder\\n and \\nLittle Walder Frey\\n, whom he\\nblames for \\nSummer\\n and \\nShaggydog\\n being locked up. When he tells \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n about his wolf dreams, Luwin\\ngives him a sleeping draught to stop the dreams, but that night he dreams he is Summer trapped in the \\ngodswood\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n prefers the stone window seat to his featherbed. Abed, the walls seem to press close about him. Although he\\ncannot walk, climb, hunt, or fight as he once did, Bran likes to watch the lights begin to glow all over \\nWinterfell\\n in\\nthe evening and to hear the \\ndirewolves\\n sing to the stars.\\nOf late, Bran often dreams of wolves. When they howl, Bran feels the direwolves are talking to him, brother to\\nbrother. He can almost understand them, as if they are singing in a language he once knew but has forgotten. His\\nmother\\n’s new wards Big Walder and Little Walder Frey might be afraid of them, but \\nOld Nan\\n told him the \\nStarks\\nhave wolf blood, though it is stronger in some than in others. \\nSummer\\n’s howls are full of grief and longing while\\nShaggydog\\n’s are savage. Their voices echo around the castle and it sounds as if a whole pack haunts Winterfell,\\ninstead of only two where once there were six. Bran wonders if the wolves miss their siblings, too.\\nWhen Bran asked why the wolves howl, everyone gave him a different answer. Ser \\nRodrik\\n the \\ncastellan\\n had no time\\nfor such idle questions, \\nFarlen\\n the kennelmaster believed it was for freedom, \\nGage\\n the cook said they wanted to\\nhunt, and \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n thought they were howling at the \\nred comet\\n because they thought it was the moon. When\\nBran repeated Luwin’s words to \\nOsha\\n the wildling, she declared that his wolves have more wit than his maester and\\nknow truths Luwin has forgotten. When Bran asked her what the comet meant, Osha replied, “Blood and fire, boy,\\nand nothing sweet.” \\nSepton\\n \\nChayle\\n thought the comet was the sword that slays the season, which makes sense to\\nBran since soon after the \\nwhite raven\\n came from the \\nCitadel\\n to announce autumn. Old Nan could not see the comet,\\nbut claimed she could smell it and said it foretold \\ndragons\\n. \\nHodor\\n only said, “Hodor.”\\nStill, the direwolves howl. The guards curse, the hounds bark, the horses kick, the Walders shiver by their fire, and\\neven Maester Luwin complains of sleepless nights. Only Bran does not seem to mind. Ser Rodrik has confined the\\nwolves to the \\ngodswood\\n after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell play tricks with sound;\\nsometimes wolves sound like they are right below Bran’s window and other times they sound like they are up on the\\ncurtain walls. Bran wishes he could see them.\\nBran can see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall, the Bell Tower, and the First Keep. Once Bran knew every\\nstone of those buildings inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys run\\ndown stairs. Their rooftops were his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower were his special friends.\\nThen he \\nfell\\n and almost died. Bran does not remember falling, yet he supposes it must be true. When his eyes fall on\\nthe weathered gargoyles atop the First Keep where it happened, Bran gets a tight feeling in his belly. Now he cannot\\nclimb, walk, run, or swordfight, and his dreams of \\nknighthood\\n have soured.\\nSummer howled when he fell, and for long after he lay broken, and Shaggydog and \\nGrey Wind\\n joined in his grief;\\n\\nRobb\\n told him so before he went away to war. The night the bloody raven brought word of his \\nfather\\n’s death, the\\nwolves knew that, too. Bran wonders who the wolves are mourning now. Has some enemy slain the \\nKing in the\\nNorth\\n who used to be his brother Robb? Or has his bastard brother \\nJon Snow\\n fallen from the Wall? Has his mother\\nor one of \\nhis\\n \\nsisters\\n died? Or is this something else, as Luwin and Chayle and Old Nan think?\\nBran thinks wistfully that if he were a direwolf he would understand. In his wolf dreams he can race up mountains\\ntaller than any tower and stand beneath the moon with the entire world below him, as it used to be. Bran cups his\\nhands and begins howling like a wolf, hesitantly at first, but Summer gives answer and so he tries again. The noise\\nbrings the guard called \\nHayhead\\n to his door, but Bran only howls at him until he leaves.\\nHayhead returns with Maester Luwin, who suggests Bran should be asleep. Bran insists that he is talking to the\\nwolves. When Luwin offers Bran assistance getting to bed, Bran insists he can do it himself with the iron bars\\nMikken\\n installed, but he does not want to sleep. Luwin insists that even princes must sleep, but Bran explains that\\nwhen he sleeps he turns into a \\nwolf\\n. He asks if wolves dream. Luwin thinks so, but not as men dream. Thinking of\\nhis father, Bran asks if dead men dream. Maester Luwin says some think so, but the dead are silent on the matter.\\nThen Bran asks if trees dream. Confused, Luwin says no, but Bran insists that they do and says he dreams of a\\nweirwood\\n tree calling to him sometimes. Bran says the wolf dreams are better; he can smell, and sometimes taste the\\nblood.\\nThis makes Maester Luwin uncomfortable, and he wishes Bran would spend more time with the other children. Bran\\ninsists that he hates the other children, meaning the Walders. He reminds Luwin that he commanded them sent\\naway. Luwin grows stern as he explains that it is not for Bran to send his mother’s wards away, and asks where they\\nwould go if they were turned out. Bran says they can go \\nhome\\n, since it is their fault he cannot be with Summer.\\nLuwin argues that Little Walder did not ask to be attacked, nor did Luwin himself. Bran reminds the maester that\\nShaggydog was the attacker; Summer never bit anyone.\\nLuwin reminds Bran that Summer tore out a man’s throat in that very room, and claims the sweet pups have grown\\ninto dangerous beasts. Bran suggests they should put the Walders in the godswood; the boys can play \\nlord of the\\ncrossing\\n all they want, and Summer can sleep with Bran again. Bran complains that no one listens to him, even\\nthough he is the prince. He is not even allowed to ride \\nDancer\\n past the gate. Luwin insists that the \\nwolfswood\\n is full\\nof dangers, recalling Bran’s \\nlast outing\\n. Bran insists stubbornly that Summer would protect him and that princes\\nshould be free to sail and hunt and joust. Luwin asks why Bran torments himself with these dreams and reminds him\\nthat he is a boy of eight. Bran loses his temper and replies:\\n“I’d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa.\\nI’d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I’d fight beside him like Grey\\nWind. I’d tear out the \\nKingslayer\\n’s throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over and everyone\\nwould come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf...Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.\\nMaester Luwin attempts to reply, but Bran only howls louder until the maester concedes and departs. Howling loses\\nits savor once Bran is alone and he quiets. Resentfully, Bran recalls that he did welcome the Walders when they\\narrived from \\nthe Twins\\n. Rickon was the one who threw the tantrum then, screaming that he wanted Mother and\\nFather and Robb, not these strangers. It was Bran who soothed him and welcomed the Freys. Even Maester Luwin\\nsaid he did well. Then they played the \\nlord of the crossing\\n game in a pool in the godswood.\\nThe game was played with a log, a stick, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The lord of the crossing\\nstood in the middle of the water and was the only one who got to use a stick. The other players had to make up\\nspeeches about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and\\nanswer questions. They didn’t have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said “Mayhaps,” so the\\ntrick was to say “Mayhaps” so the lord of the crossing didn’t notice, then knock the lord into the water and become\\nthe new lord of the crossing. In practice, the game came down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into the water,\\nalong with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone said “Mayhaps.”\\nLittle Walder was lord of the crossing as often as not. He is Little Walder even though he is tall and stout with a big\\nbelly. His cousin, Big Walder, is sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. The names came about because Big\\nWalder is fifty-two days older, so he was bigger at first. Big Walder explained that there were bunches of Walders at\\nthe Twins, as well as a number of girls named Walda, all named after the boys’ grandfather, Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n.\\n\\nBran watched wistfully while the Walders played the lord of the crossing game with \\nTurnip\\n the cook’s boy and\\nJoseth\\n’s girls \\nBandy\\n and \\nShyra\\n. The Walders had decreed that Bran should judge whether people said “Mayhaps,”\\nbut as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him. The shouts and splashes soon drew others: \\nPalla\\n the\\nkennel girl, \\nCayn\\n’s boy \\nCalon\\n, and \\nFat Tom\\n’s son \\nTomToo\\n. Before long everyone was soaked, muddy, and\\nlaughing. Bran had not heard so much laughter since the bloody raven arrived. Bitterly, Bran told himself that no\\none would be lord of the crossing but him if he could use his legs. Then Rickon came running into the godswood\\nwith Shaggydog and wanted to play. Shaggydog obeyed the command to stay until the first time Little Walder hit\\nRickon with the stick. Then, before Bran could blink, the black wolf attacked Little Walder.\\nOddly, after that Rickon decided he liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again, but they play\\nmonsters and maidens, rats and cats, and come-into-my-castle. They plunder the kitchens, race around the walls, toss\\nbones to the pups, and train with wooden swords. But when Rickon showed them the crypts under the castle, Bran\\nhad screamed that Rickon had no right to show them a Stark place.\\nThe door to the bedchamber opens and Maester Luwin returns with Osha, Hayhead, and a sleeping draught. Osha\\nscoops Bran up and carries him effortlessly to bed. Luwin assures Bran that the draught will give him a dreamless\\nsleep. Bran wants to believe him. After he has taken the draught, Osha lingers behind to ask if it is the wolf dreams\\nagain. When Bran nods, Osha says he should not fight so hard, since maybe the \\nold gods\\n are trying to answer all his\\ntalk to the \\nheart tree\\n. Bran fades off to sleep before he can really reply, but when the darkness closes over him, he\\nfinds himself moving silently through the godswood. Part of him knows it is only a dream, but even the dream of\\nwalking is better than the truth of his bedchamber.\\nIn his dream it is dark amongst the trees but the comet lights his way as he moves, swift and strong on four good\\nlegs. He can feel the ground underfoot and the smells fill his head. The scent of squirrel reminds him of the taste of\\nhot blood and bones cracking between his teeth. Slaver runs from his jaws, and he can hear the squirrel chittering\\nand rustling safe above him. He can smell his brother, too, loping around and around, tirelessly searching but never\\nfinding: for prey, for a way out, for his mother, for his littermates, for his pack.\\nBehind the trees the walls rise higher than any wolf can leap. Cold iron and splintery wood close off the only exits,\\nbut his brother still stops at each one to fruitless bare his fangs in rage. He did the same the first night, but learned it\\nwas no good; circling the walls will not push them back and marking the trees will keep no men away. The world\\nhas tightened around them, but beyond the wall still stands Winterfell, and beyond that the true world calls him, and\\nhe knows he must answer or die.\\nNavigation:\\nBran VII\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nTyrion I\\n ←\\nBran I\\n→ \\nArya II\\n↓\\nBran II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 5: Arya II\\nPlace(s): \\nAn inn on the \\nkingsroad\\n.\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya I\\n↑\\nBran I\\n ←\\nArya II\\n→ \\nJon I\\n↓\\nArya III\\nArya\\n and the others encounter more refugees every day as they journey north. One evening they halt at an inn,\\nwhere they hear news of the war in the \\nriverlands\\n. Outside the inn, Arya talks with the prisoner \\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\n. Soon\\nafter, six \\ngold cloaks\\n arrive with an arrest warrant for the \\nBull\\n, but \\nYoren\\n refuses and after a tense standoff the gold\\ncloaks retreat.\\nSynopsis\\nEach day, \\nArya\\n and the others travel from dawn to dusk, and at night they eat by the light of the \\nRed Sword\\n. The\\nmen take turns standing watch, since they can see the firelight of other travellers. Every night there are more camps\\nand every day there is more traffic on the \\nkingsroad\\n. They meet every kind of person and every mode of\\ntransportation, but most come by foot, with their goods on their shoulders and wary looks on their faces. They are all\\nheaded south toward \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, and Arya wonders why no one else is going north like them.\\nOne morning, a passing merchant offers to buy \\nYoren\\n’s wagons for a quarter of their worth. He explains there is war\\nto the north and claims Yoren will do better selling to him than being robbed by soldiers, but Yoren refuses. That\\nsame day, Arya notices the first grave (dug for a child) and a few leagues on \\nPraed\\n points out a whole row of them.\\nAfter that hardly a day passes without seeing one.\\nOne night, Arya wakes to find the night oddly quiet. When Praed does not wake the next morning, Arya realizes it\\nwas his coughing that was missing. They bury the sellsword where he slept and split his valuables amongst them.\\nYoren gives the longsword to the Bull, claiming he has the arm to learn to wield it.\\nThat evening they stop in a village at an ivy-covered inn. They cannot afford rooms, but Yoren arranges a hot meal\\nand use of the bathhouse if anyone feels the need. Arya knows she must smell as bad as Yoren, but cannot risk\\nrevealing her gender by bathing. She rationalizes that it would be a shame to drown the creatures living in her\\nclothes that have come all the way from \\nFlea Bottom\\n. The \\nBull\\n, \\nTarber\\n, and \\nHot Pie\\n line up for the bathhouse with\\nsome of the other men while the rest crowd into the common room. Yoren even sends \\nLommy\\n out with tankards for\\nthe three men who remain fettered in the wagon.\\nThe innkeeper gives them all a round of beer on the house and tells them his brother \\nLync\\n was sent to the \\nWall\\n for\\nfilching pepper from his \\nlord\\n’s table. Arya sips her beer cautiously, remembering how she enjoyed beer when her\\nfather permitted it and how \\nSansa\\n would make a sour face and insist wine was ever so much finer. The memories\\nmake her sad.\\nThe inn is full of refugees who scorn Yoren’s plan to continue north. The innkeeper explains that half the fields are\\nburnt, and the remaining people are walled up in holdfasts. Yoren insists that the \\nNight’s Watch\\n takes not part, but\\nthe innkeeper points out that \\nwild men\\n have come down from the \\nMountains of the Moon\\n and the \\nyoung Lord Stark\\nhas come south to war. Mention of her brother grabs Arya’s attention. A man named \\nHod\\n claims that Robb rides\\ninto battle on a wolf as big as a horse, which no one seems to believe.\\nThen talk turns to the great pack of wolves near the \\nGods Eye\\n who have even attacked men, led by a she-wolf from\\nthe seventh hell. Talk of a she-wolf makes Arya wonder if the Gods Eye is near the \\nTrident\\n, where she was forced to\\n\\nleave her \\ndirewolf\\n \\nNymeria\\n. One of the travellers claims that this she-wolf once snatched a baby from its mother’s\\narms in the midst of a village, and that the men who pursued lost all of their dogs and nearly their lives. Arya blurts\\nout that this is just a story because wolves do not eat babies. The man asks what Arya would know about wolves, but\\nYoren gives her a shove and orders her outside before she can answer.\\nOutside, the youngest and handsomest of the three men in the wagon calls to her with a friendly voice. Arya\\napproaches warily with one hand on \\nNeedle\\n. The man is slender and fine-featured with red hair on one side and\\nwhite on the other. He speaks in a strange syntax, referring to himself as “a man” and to Arya as “a boy,” and his\\naccent reminds her of \\nSyrio Forel\\n. He asks for another beer and suggests he could use a bath, claiming Arya could\\nmake a friend. Arya insist that she has friends, but the noseless prisoner remarks that he cannot see any. The third\\nprisoner only hisses and sticks out the stump of his tongue.\\nThe friendly prisoner begs forgiveness for his present company, and introduces himself as \\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\n from\\nLorath\\n. He introduces the noseless man as \\nRorge\\n and the other as \\nBiter\\n (a name Jaqen gave the mute because of his\\nfiled teeth). Rorge curses and throws his tankard at Arya, demanding more beer, but she manages to dodge. Asking\\nherself what Syrio would do, Arya draws her practice sword. Rorge threatens her, but Arya recalls her mantra, “Fear\\ncuts deeper than swords,” and approaches the wagon. When Biter lurches at her, Arya hits him hard right between\\nthe eyes. Biter reels back but then throws all his weight against his chains and attempts to grab her again. When the\\nbonds hold and Biter collapses, Jaqen H’ghar observes that Arya has more courage than sense.\\nArya backs away from the wagon again. When she feels a hand on her shoulder she whirls around, but it is only the\\nBull, who reminds her that Yoren warned them not to go near the three in the wagon. Arya insists they do not scare\\nher, but the Bull replies, “Then you’re stupid. They scare me.” As the Bull leads her away, Arya hears Rorge\\nlaughing and Biter hissing behind them.\\nWanting to hit something, Arya asks if the Bull wants to fight. Startled, he warns her how strong he is, but Arya\\nargues that she is quick. The Bull draws Praed’s longsword and declares it cheap steal, but still a real sword. Arya\\ndraws Needle and declares that it is good steel, which makes it even realer. They each ask the other to promise not to\\ncry if they get cut. Arya assumes her \\nwater dancer\\n\\'s stance, but the Bull is distracted by six \\ngold cloaks\\n riding up the\\nkingsroad on lathered horses.\\nAs the gold cloaks draw up in front of the inn, Arya pulls the Bull behind a tall hedge and tells him to be quiet as a\\nshadow. The gold cloak officer asks some of the recruits outside the bathhouse if they are the ones who left King’s\\nLanding to take the black. The men say they might be, so the officer dismounts and declares he has a warrant for a\\ncertain boy.\\nYoren steps out of the inn to ask who wants the boy. The officer presents his warrant and declares that Queen \\nCersei\\nsent them. Behind the hedge, the Bull asks why he and Arya are hiding. Arya explains that it her they are after. The\\nBull asks why the queen would want her, but Arya tells him to be quiet. Yoren declares the warrant pretty, but\\ninsists that the boy is in the Night’s Watch so what he did back in the city does not matter. The officer declares that\\nneither he nor the queen cares. Arya considers running, but knows she cannot escape. She decides she is tired of\\nrunning; a real water dancer would never run.\\nYoren insists that the gold cloaks will have no one, since there are laws on such things. The officer draws his\\nshortsword and declares it his law. Yoren only looks at the blade and declares, “That’s no law, just a sword.\\nHappens I got one too.” The officer threatens that he has five men with him, but Yoren spits and declares that he has\\nthirty. A gold cloak with a broken nose laughs and asks who is first. In a gesture of solidarity, Tarber takes up a\\npitchfork, \\nCutjack\\n pulls out his hammer, \\nKurz\\n draws his skinning knife, \\nKoss\\n strings his longbow, \\nReysen\\n snatches\\nup his staff, \\nDobber\\n (fresh from the bath) drops everything but his dagger, and \\nHot Pie\\n scrambles to find a big rock.\\nArya is amazed; she hates Hot Pie, so why would he risk his life for her?\\nRefusing to let the others die for her, Arya shoves through the hedge with Needle and joins the others. The gold\\ncloak with the broken nose laughs and tells her to put away the blade, calling her a girl. Arya insist she is not a girl,\\nfurious that they do not understand she is the one they want. Yet when the Bull comes up behind her the officer\\ndeclares him the one they want. It is a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, however, and quick as a snake Yoren\\nplaces his sword at the officer’s throat.\\n\\nYoren declares that the gold cloaks will have neither of them, and reminds the officer that he has even more brothers\\nin the inn. The officer drops his sword and Yoren declares that good steel is always needed on the Wall. The officer\\ndeclares that Yoren had best hurry back to the Wall, and promises that if he catches Yoren again he will take his\\nhead as well the boy\\'s. Yoren declares that better men have tried and slaps the officer’s horse with his sword. The\\nother gold cloaks follow.\\nOnce the gold cloaks are out of sight, Hot Pie whoops in triumph, but Yoren remains angry and orders everyone up\\nand moving; if they ride all night they may be able to stay ahead for awhile. After giving the officer’s sword to Hot\\nPie, Yoren walks over to the Bull and declares that the queen wants him bad. Arya asks why the queen would want a\\nbastard boy like the Bull, but the Bull asks why she would want a gutter rat like Arya. Suspicious that the Bull is\\nmore than he appears, Arya asks his true name. He replies that it is Gendry. Yoren claims not to know why anyone\\nwould want either of them, but declares they cannot have them regardless. He orders Gendry and Arya to take the\\ntwo coursers and orders them to ride hard for the Wall at the first sight of a gold cloak, since the rest of them mean\\nnothing to the gold cloaks. Arya points out that the officer promised to take Yoren’s head, but Yoren replies that if\\nthe man can take it he is welcome to it.\\nNavigation:\\nArya I\\n↑\\nBran I\\n ←\\nArya II\\n→ \\nJon I\\n↓\\nArya III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 6: Jon I\\nPlace(s): \\nCastle Black\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon IX\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nArya II\\n ←\\nJon I\\n→ \\nCatelyn I\\n↓\\nJon II\\nJon Snow\\n finds \\nSamwell Tarly\\n in the dark library cellar of \\nCastle Black\\n, where Sam has found a number of maps for\\nthe great ranging\\n. Out in the courtyard they watch the new recruits practicing and Jon talks with \\nDonal Noye\\n. After\\nthey present their maps, \\nLord Commander\\n \\nJeor Mormont\\n discusses \\nMaester Aemon\\n’s past with Jon.\\nSynopsis\\nJon\\n calls out to \\nSamwell Tarly\\n amidst the ancient books and scrolls of \\nCastle Black\\n’s library. Jon wends his way\\ndown the narrow aisles toward the glow of Sam’s lamp to find the fat boy hunched over a table. When Jon asks if he\\nhas been there all night, Sam reveals that he lost all track of time in the windowless cellar. Jon calls Sam a sweet\\nfool and reminds him that soon they will be sleeping on hard ground, not soft beds. Sam yawns and explains that\\nMaester Aemon\\n sent him to find maps for \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n, but he never thought there would be\\nthousands of interesting documents to read. Jon is unimpressed by the books and asks if Sam found the maps.\\nSam gestures toward a clutter of books and scrolls on the table and declares he has found at least a dozen. He shows\\nJon a faded parchment that marks the sites of many \\nwildling\\n villages. Then he excitedly shows Jon an account of a\\nranging to \\nLorn Point\\n by a ranger named \\nRedwyn\\n from before the \\nTargaryen Conquest\\n that mentions fighting with\\ngiants\\n and trading with the \\nchildren of the forest\\n. Meaning to sound encouraging, Jon suggests that Sam can write an\\naccount of their own \\ngreat ranging\\n, but talk of what they are to face on the morrow makes Sam uncomfortable. He\\nshuffles scrolls about and says there are more maps if he only had time to set the library in order, which will take\\nyears. Jon remarks that the Lord Commander wanted the maps a little sooner than that.\\nWhen Jon picks up a scroll it crumbles in his hand. Sam explains that the most important documents were copied\\nover when needed, and the oldest have likely been copied half a hundred times. Jon says there is no need to copy\\nthis one, which is only a list of goods. Sam seems fascinated, but Jon wonders who would care how much pickled\\ncod men ate six hundred years ago. Sam insists that he would, since it can tell them how many men were in the\\nNight’s Watch\\n, and how they lived, and what they ate. Jon responds that they ate food and lived as he and Sam do.\\nSam disagrees and claims that the vault is a treasure trove. Jon is dubious: to him treasure means gold, silver, and\\njewels. Sam has also found works even the \\nCitadel\\n does not have: drawings of \\nweirwood\\n faces, thousand year old\\ncounts of the seasons, scrolls from old \\nValyria\\n, and even a book about the language of the children of the forest.\\nJon assures Sam the books will still be here when they return, but Sam replies, “If we return.” Jon tries to reassure\\nSam by pointing out that Mormont is taking 200 seasoned men (most of them rangers), and \\nQhorin Halfhand\\n will\\njoin them with 100 more from the \\nShadow Tower\\n. He insists Sam will be as safe as back at \\nHorn Hill\\n, but Sam\\nreplies that he was never very safe there either.\\nJon thinks it a cruel joke that \\nPyp\\n and \\nToad\\n (who want to go) are to remain behind while Sam (the self-proclaimed\\ncoward) must go in Maester Aemon’s place to tend the two cages of ravens. Sam argues that Jon or \\nGrenn\\n could\\ncare for the ravens, and Jon can write messages as well as he can. Jon insists that he has his own duties as the Lord\\nCommander’s steward. He reminds Sam that he said the vows, but Sam says that a brother of the Night’s Watch\\nshould not be so scared. Jon insists they are all scared, and they should be with so many rangers disappearing in the\\nlast two years, but what matters is how they face it. Then he offers to help gather up the maps and they depart the\\n\\nlibrary.\\nThe vault opens onto one of the underground passages called the wormwalks, which bind Castle Black together in\\nwinter. Jon thinks of the \\nwhite raven\\n that came to Maester Aemon, and knows winter will come soon. He remembers\\nthe last winter, which was short and mild, but he can feel that this one will be different. By the time they reach the\\nsurface, Sam is out of breath. The sight of \\nthe Wall\\n reminds Jon that it marks the end of the world, and tomorrow\\nthey are going beyond it.\\nThe morning sky is streaked by clouds but the \\nred comet\\n is still visible behind them, even by day. The black brothers\\nhave dubbed it “Mormont’s Torch,” claiming (only half in jest) that the gods have sent it to light the way through\\nthe \\nhaunted forest\\n. The castle seems deserted with so many gone to the brothel in \\nMole\\'s Town\\n. Grenn is among\\nthem, since Pyp and \\nHalder\\n and Toad offered to buy him his first woman. They invited Jon and Sam as well, but Jon\\ninsisted on keeping his vow of celibacy and Sam is as frightened of whores as he is of everything else.\\nAs they pass the \\nsept\\n, they hear a hymn being sung. Jon notes that on the eve of battle some men want whores and\\nsome want gods. He wonders who feels better after. The sept tempts him no more than the brothel; the \\nSeven\\n have\\nno power beyond the Wall, but the nameless \\nold gods\\n whom Jon worships will be waiting there.\\nOutside the armory, Ser \\nEndrew Tarth\\n is training the six new recruits brought in the previous night. Ser Endrew is a\\ngentler master-at-arms than Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\n, but his lessons can still raise bruises. Sam winces at the sight, but\\nJon watches closely. From the door of the armory, the one-armed smith \\nDonal Noye\\n asks Jon’s opinion of the\\nrecruits. Jon declares they smell of summer and asks where \\nConwy\\n recruited them. Noye says it was a dungeon near\\nGulltown\\n and labels the recruits as a brigand, a barber, a \\nbeggar\\n, \\ntwo\\n \\norphans\\n, and a \\nboy whore\\n. Jon replies that they\\nwill do; he and Sam did.\\nNoye asks Jon if he has heard that his brother \\nRobb Stark\\n is now a \\nking\\n. Jon admits that last night in the common\\nroom there was talk of little else. Jon is still unsure how he feels about the brother he grew up with becoming a king\\nwhile he remains on the Wall, but he tells Noye that Robb will make a good king. Noye is not so sure and declares\\nthat once he might have said the same of \\nRobert Baratheon\\n, but Robert was never the same after he put on the\\ncrown. Noye confirms that he forged Robert’s warhammer and claims he knew the \\nBaratheon\\n brothers as well as\\nanyone. The smith compares Robert to a sword: made for fighting and prone to rust if left unused. When Jon asks if\\nRobert’s brothers are the same, Noye considers for a moment then declares:\\nRobert was the true steel. \\nStannis\\n is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets.\\nHe’ll break before he bends. And \\nRenly\\n, that one, he’s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth\\nall that much at the end of the day.\\nJon wonders what metal Robb is, but decides it is best not to ask. Noye was a Baratheon man before taking the black\\nand likely believes Robb is a traitor. There is an unspoken pact amongst the Watch not to probe too deeply into such\\nmatters since old loyalties are not easily forgotten. Even Sam’s former \\nHouse\\n is sworn to \\nHighgarden\\n, which has\\nsupported Renly. As Jon departs with Sam, Noye offers a prayer for Jon on the morrow and urges him to bring his\\nuncle\\n back.\\nJon leaves Ghost outside the door of the King’s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont resides now that fire has\\ngutted his own tower. Sam is disheartened by the number of stairs, but Jon jests that stairs are one thing they will not\\nconfront beyond the Wall.\\nWhen they enter the solar, Mormont complains about how long it took them. Ignoring the boys, \\nThoren Smallwood\\nargues that the Lord Commander’s place is at Castle Black. Mormont declares that Smallwood can do as he likes if\\nhe ever becomes Lord Commander. Smallwood insists that the command should be his as First Ranger, but\\nMormont will have none of it. He declares that he already sent out two rangings and will not wait and wonder if the\\nthird is lost as well. Mormont dismisses Smallwood with the reminder that Benjen Stark remains First Ranger until\\nhis death is confirmed. Once Smallwood is gone, Mormont exclaims that he would sooner name Sam as First\\nRanger and complains that Smallwood called him too old for a ranging.\\nBrusquely examining the maps, Mormont asks if they were all Sam could find. When Sam stutters, Jon points out\\nthat the villages might be gone, but the geography will still be correct. Mormont asks Sam about the ravens and\\n\\ncommands that he wants the best, saying that if they are all butchered he means for his successor to know where and\\nhow. Talk of butchery leaves Sam open-mouthed and speechless. Mormont declares he is too busy for such behavior\\nand dismisses Sam, who almost trips in his haste to leave.\\nMormont asks, without waiting for an answer, whether Sam is as big a fool as he seems. He explains that he was\\nconsidering sending Sam as an envoy to King Renly, since his \\nfather\\n stands high in Renly’s councils, but Renly is\\nnot likely to heed a quaking fat boy so Ser \\nArnell\\n (whose mother was a \\ngreen-apple Fossoway\\n) will go instead. Jon\\nasks what Mormont would have of King Renly, and Mormont replies that he will take anything that is offered.\\nMormont continues that Ser Alliser Thorne should reach King \\nJoffrey\\n soon, but \\nHouse Lannister\\n has never been a\\nfriend to the Watch. Jon points out that Thorne does have the twitching \\nwight\\n’s hand to show them. Mormont\\nlaments they do not have a second hand to send to Renly. Jon remarks that \\nDywen\\n claims a man can find anything\\nbeyond the Wall. Mormont scoffs that Dywen also claims he saw a bear fifteen feet tall, insisting a man must\\nbelieve his own eyes.\\nTurning the conversation back to hands, Mormont asks Jon about his burned hand. Jon explains it is well enough to\\nwield \\nLongclaw\\n and that he is exercising the fingers as Maester Aemon suggested. Mormont opines that Aemon\\nknows his work and prays they can keep him another twenty years. Then he asks if Jon knows that Aemon could\\nhave been king. Jon is taken by surprise; he assumed the maester was a younger son of a king.\\nMormont explains that Aemon \\nwas\\n a younger son, the third son of King \\nMaekar I Targaryen\\n, who was himself the\\nfourth son of King \\nDaeron II Targaryen\\n. Slow of sword but quick of wit, Aemon was sent to the Citadel when he\\nwas nine or ten and ninth or tenth in the succession. Jon struggles to imagine the 100-year-old maester as a little boy.\\nMormont continues that Crown Prince \\nBaelor\\n died in a \\ntourney\\n mishap and soon after his two sons, \\nValarr\\n and\\nMatarys\\n died in the \\nGreat Spring Sickness\\n along with King Daeron, so the crown passed to Daeron’s second son,\\nAerys I Targaryen\\n. Aerys reigned for twelve years (during which Aemon took his vows as a maester) then died\\nwithout issue and the throne passed to Aemon’s father Maekar I. During his father’s reign, Aemon’s eldest brother,\\nDaeron \"the Drunken\"\\n, died of a pox, leaving only \\na feeble-minded daughter\\n, and his second brother, \\nAerion\\nTargaryen\\n, who killed himself by drinking \\nwildfire\\n, believing it would turn him into a \\ndragon\\n. Less than a year later,\\nKing Maekar died in battle with an outlaw lord.\\nA \\nGreat Council\\n was convened to decide on the succession. It passed over Aerion’s infant son and quietly offered\\nthe throne to Maester Aemon, but Aemon chose to abide by his vows even after the \\nHigh Septon\\n offered to absolve\\nhim. Therefore, his younger brother, \\nAegon V Targaryen\\n, was named king, and became known as \"the Unlikely\"\\nbecause (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that\\nthose dissatisfied with his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so he became a member of the Night’s Watch and\\nremained at the Wall while his brother’s descendents ruled as kings until \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n put an end to the line of\\nthe \\nDragonkings\\n.\\nMormont’s raven begins repeating the word “king.” Jon notes that the bird seems to like the word, and jests that\\nperhaps the raven believes Mormont should have a crown. Mormont declares that there are three kings already,\\nwhich is two too many for his liking.\\nJon asks why Mormont has told him all this about Maester Aemon. Mormont explains that Jon and Aemon have\\nsomething in common: a king for a brother. Jon points out that they also share a vow. Mormont comments that if he\\nhad a man for every vow he has seen broken the Wall would never lack for defenders. Jon says he always knew\\nRobb would be Lord of Winterfell, but Mormont insists that a king is a different thing:\\nThey will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and\\ndie in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You’ll have no wife, nor will\\nyou ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow.\\nHim they’ll call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go\\nunsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon... and I’ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it.\\nJon asks what a bastard like himself might do if these facts did trouble him, but Mormont asks what Jon \\nwill\\n do. Jon\\ndeclares that he will be troubled, and keep his vows.\\n\\nNavigation:\\nJon IX\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nArya II\\n ←\\nJon I\\n→ \\nCatelyn I\\n↓\\nJon II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 7: Catelyn I\\nPlace(s): \\nRiverrun\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn XI\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nJon I\\n ←\\nCatelyn I\\n→ \\nTyrion II\\n↓\\nCatelyn II\\nCatelyn Stark\\n watches as her son \\nKing\\n \\nRobb Stark\\n presents his peace terms to his envoy Ser \\nCleos Frey\\n.

Later, Catelyn discusses the war with \\nBrynden Tully\\n and they plan an alliance with King \\nRenly\\nBaratheon\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nAs they wait in \\nRiverrun\\n\\'s Great Hall, \\nCatelyn\\n watches her son \\nRobb\\n restlessly adjust his new-forged crown several\\ntimes, and remarks to herself that a crown is not easy to wear, especially for a boy of fifteen years.\\nThe ancient crown of the \\nKings of Winter\\n was lost three centuries ago when \\nTorrhen Stark\\n submitted to \\nAegon the\\nConqueror\\n, but the smiths have done well to match the descriptions: an open circlet of hammered bronze\\nsurmounted by nine black iron spikes in the shape of longswords. There is no gold, or silver, or gems; bronze and\\niron are the metals of winter, dark and strong.\\nAs the guards bring in the captive, Robb lays his sword across his knees in the customary gesture of hostility. As Ser\\nCleos Frey\\n is forced to his knees, Catelyn reflects that he does not look like a \\nLannister\\n. Although his mother Lady\\nGenna\\n is sister to Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n, Ser Cleos has inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of\\nhis father, Ser \\nEmmon Frey\\n.\\nRobb\\'s sword glimmers faintly as he bids Ser Cleos to rise, but it is \\nGrey Wind\\n who frightens the knight. As big as\\nany elkhound, Robb\\'s \\ndirewolf\\n sniffs at Ser Cleos, who was captured in the \\nWhispering Wood\\n where Grey Wind\\nkilled half a dozen men. Ser Cleos scrambles to his feet and away from the direwolf so quickly that it provokes\\nlaughter from the audience. Ser Cleos thanks Robb, calling him “my lord,” but \\nGreatjon Umber\\n corrects that a king\\nis styled “Your Grace.” Ser Cleos accepts the correction, and Catelyn notes that he truly is more \\nFrey\\n than Lannister;\\nthey would never have gotten such an honorific out of \\nJaime Lannister\\n.\\nRobb wishes Ser Cleos to be his envoy to Queen \\nCersei\\n in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n. Robb reminds Ser Cleos that he\\nconsiders him a Lannister, not a Frey, since he sided with the Lannisters in the Whispering Wood. He therefore\\nexpects Ser Cleos to return with the queen\\'s reply and resume his captivity. Ser Cleos vows on his \\nknighthood\\n to do\\nso, and asks what the message is. Robb offers to make peace if his if his terms are met. At the back of the hall, Lord\\nRickard Karstark\\n shoves through a rank of guards and out the door, but Robb pays no attention. Exchanging his\\nsword for a parchment, Robb reads his terms:\\nFirst, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King\\'s Landing to \\nWhite\\nHarbor\\n. It is to be understood that \\nSansa\\n\\'s betrothal to \\nJoffrey Baratheon\\n is at an end. When I receive word\\nfrom my \\ncastellan\\n that my sisters have returned unharmed to \\nWinterfell\\n, I will release the queen\\'s cousins, the\\nsquire \\nWillem Lannister\\n and your brother \\nTion Frey\\n, and give them safe escort to \\nCasterly Rock\\n or\\nwheresoever she desires them delivered.\\nSecondly, my \\nlord father\\n\\'s bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his \\nbrother\\n and \\nsister\\n in the crypts\\n\\nbeneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his\\nservice at King\\'s Landing must also be returned.\\nThird, my father\\'s greatsword \\nIce\\n will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun.\\nFourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine\\nthat he took captive in the \\nbattle on the Green Fork\\n of the \\nTrident\\n. Once he does so, I shall release my own\\ncaptives taken in the Whispering Wood and the \\nBattle of the Camps\\n, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will\\nremain my hostage for his father\\'s good behavior.\\nLastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over \\nthe north\\n. Henceforth we\\nare no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain shall include all the \\nStark\\nlands north of \\nthe Neck\\n, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded\\nby the \\nGolden Tooth\\n to the west and the \\nMountains of the Moon\\n in the east.\\nAfter a cheer from the Greatjon, Robb states he will provide a map of the new borders. He declares that Lord Tywin\\nmust cease his raids and withdraw, King Joffrey must rescind all claims to Robb\\'s lands and subjects, and the\\nLannisters must deliver ten highborn hostages as a pledge of peace. Robb promises to release two hostages every\\nyear so long as the pact is honored, but if it is not he will give Queen Cersei another Whispering Wood. To\\nemphasize his point, Robb whistles and Grey Wind comes forward and snarls. The Greatjon raises another cheer and\\nGrey Wind howls. When Ser Cleos agrees, Robb orders him to depart with Ser \\nRobin Ryger\\n at first light and\\ndismisses the assembly.\\nOut in the gallery, Catelyn compliments her son\\'s performance, but notes that the theatrics with Grey Wind befit a\\nboy more than a king. Robb only smiles and asks if she saw Ser Cleos\\' face. Catelyn replies that what she saw was\\nRickard Karstark storming out. Robb admits he saw it as well. Catelyn\\'s brother \\nEdmure Tully\\n comments that others\\nmay agree with Lord Rickard, and asks how they can talk of peace while the Lannisters are still pillaging the\\nRiverlands\\n. He urges Robb to march on Lord Tywin at \\nHarrenhal\\n, but Robb insists he does not have the strength.\\nEdmure points out that they only grow weaker sitting here.\\nCatelyn snaps that it was Edmure\\'s idea to permit the river lords to depart for their own lands. Edmure argues that he\\ncannot command his lords to remain idle while their crops are burnt and their people killed, but it would be an ill\\nthing if a northman like Lord Rickard left them. Robb agrees to speak with Lord Rickard, but he cannot blame the\\nman for loathing peace with \\nhis\\n \\nsons\\n\\' killers. Catelyn points out that more bloodshed will not bring back the dead.\\nShe suggests a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms, but Robb declares that sweeter terms would have\\ngagged him. Catelyn realizes that her son wants vengeance as much as Lord Rickard.\\nCatelyn points out that Cersei will never trade Sansa and \\nArya\\n for a pair of cousins when what she wants is her\\nbrother Jaime. Robb explains that his bannermen will never allow him to release the Kingslayer, even if he wanted\\nto. Catelyn says the lords made Robb their king, but Robb replies that they can unmake him just as easy. Catelyn\\nargues that the safe return of the girls is worth Robb\\'s crown, fearing for her daughters if something bad should\\nbefall Jaime in their custody. Robb assures her that no one sees Jaime without his warrant.\\nCatelyn asks if Robb is afraid to face Jaime in the field again. Edmure sides with Robb, but accidentally refers to\\nhim as \"the boy.\" Robb roars at Edmure not to call him a boy and declares he can defeat Jaime again if he must. He\\nadmits he would have traded Jaime for his father, but looks hurt when Catelyn presses him to say whether the girls\\nare important enough. Catelyn realizes that Robb is doing his best, yet she cannot bear the thought of losing her\\ndaughters as well as her husband. Robb promises that if Cersei refuses peace he will do all he can for his sisters by\\nmaking her rue the decision.\\nCatelyn can sense Robb is tired of the subject. He asks her to go to \\nthe Twins\\n to meet Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n\\'s daughters\\nand help choose his future bride. Catelyn sees this as an excuse to send her away for saying things Robb does not\\nwant to hear, so she tells Robb he is old enough to choose for himself. Next, Robb urges her to accompany \\nTheon\\nGreyjoy\\n and the \\nMallisters\\n to \\nSeagard\\n, and return by ship to Winterfell to be with \\nBran\\n and \\nRickon\\n. Catelyn insists\\nthat until her father dies her place is at Riverrun.\\nRobb mentions that he could command her to go, but Catelyn counters by asking Robb to reconsider sending Theon\\n\\nas his envoy to \\nPyke\\n. Robb asks who would be better to negotiate with Lord \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n than his son. Catelyn\\ninsists that \\nanyone\\n would be better. Robb argues that Theon fought bravely for them and they have need of his\\nfather\\'s longships. Catelyn replies that they will get the ships sooner if Theon remains a hostage. She also insists\\nBalon is not trustworthy and may aspire to wear a crown \\nagain\\n himself. Robb declares he will gladly give Balon a\\ncrown if it helps defeat the Lannisters. Before Catelyn can reply, Robb walks off and Catelyn can only watch him\\ngo, remembering back at \\nMoat Cailin\\n when she urged him to command as he does now.\\nCatelyn asks Edmure to join her in father\\'s sickroom, but he begs off to speak with some new recruits. On her way to\\nthe central keep, Catelyn shortcuts through the \\ngodswood\\n, where the leaves still rustle on the trees, ignorant of the\\nwhite raven\\n that has proclaimed the arrival of autumn. Catelyn is thankful that the weather is holding, since autumn\\nis a fearful time when even the wisest never know if the next harvest will be the last.\\nShe finds Lord \\nHoster Tully\\n sleeping in his solar, made frail by the death growing within him. Beside the bed sits\\nher uncle, Ser \\nBynden the Blackfish\\n. When Catelyn asks if Robb knows of his return, the Blackfish says he did not\\ninterrupt the court because Robb will want to hear his news in private first. When her uncle asks about her father,\\nCatelyn confesses that he grows weaker every day, and sometimes his mind is unclear. The Blackfish admits that he\\nalways wonders if his brother will be dead upon his return. Catelyn comforts him that at least he made his peace\\nwith her father.\\nThey sit silently for a long time before Catelyn asks for the Blackfish\\'s tidings. To avoid waking her father, they\\nadjourn to the balcony. Her uncle comments that the \\nred comet\\n is now visible by day, and says his men call it the\\n“Red Messenger,” though he wonders what the message is. Catelyn says the Greatjon claims it is a red flag of\\nvengeance for her husband, while Edmure claims it is a victory omen: a fish in \\nTully\\n colors, red against blue.\\nCatelyn only sees the crimson of House Lannister, but her uncle points out that the comet is neither Lannister\\ncrimson nor Tully red, but a smear of blood across the sky. Catelyn asks whose blood, but the Blackfish asks if there\\nwas ever a war where only one side bled.\\nThe Blackfish explains that the war has spread south to the \\nBlackwater Rush\\n and north nearly to the Twins. \\nMarq\\nPiper\\n and \\nKaryl Vance\\n have won small victories, and \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n is harassing Lord Tywin\\'s raiders and\\nforagers. Ser \\nBurton Crakehall\\n boasted of killing Dondarrion until Dondarrion killed him in an ambush. Catelyn\\nremembers that some of her husband\\'s household guard rode with Dondarrion from King\\'s Landing and blesses their\\nactions.\\nThe Blackfish comments that Dondarrion and \\nThoros of Myr\\n are clever enough to play hit and run, but Robb should\\nnever have permitted the river lords return to their own lands. \\nJonos Bracken\\n was wounded and lost his heir \\nHendry\\nreclaiming \\nStone Hedge\\n, \\nTytos Blackwood\\n is left with only \\nRaventree Hall\\n, and young \\nLyman Darry\\n was killed by\\nGregor Clegane\\n less than a fortnight after reclaiming \\nCastle Darry\\n. The Blackfish declares that Clegane\\'s head\\nwould make a noble gift for all the people of the realm.\\nTalk of heads reminds Catelyn that her husband\\'s remains mounted on spike above the \\nRed Keep\\n. She reminds her\\nuncle that Gregor Clegane is only a servant of Lord Tywin, whom Catelyn believes is the true danger. The Blackfish\\nagrees, noting Tywin\\'s wisdom in sitting safe in Harrenhal and living off their harvests and burning what he does not\\ntake. In addition to Clegane, Ser \\nAmory Lorch\\n and a \\nQohorik\\n \\nsellsword\\n are also abroad, raping, burning, and\\nbutchering. Catelyn knows Edmure will rage at the news. She also admits Robb is restless and may listen if Edmure\\nand the Greatjon will urge him to march on Harrenhal. The Blackfish declares that is exactly what Lord Tywin\\nwishes, and the first rule of war is to never give the enemy his wish.\\nCatelyn recalls the tales of the vast fortress of Harrenhal by the waters of the \\nGods Eye\\n. King \\nHarren the Black\\nbeggared the Riverlands and the \\nIron Islands\\n alike to realize his dream of the highest hall and tallest towers in\\nWesteros\\n, but thick walls and high towers proved small use against Aegon the Conqueror\\'s \\ndragons\\n. Harren and all\\nhis line perished in the fires that engulfed the fortress. Strong the castle might be, but also cursed, for every House\\nthat has held Harrenhal since has come to misfortune.\\nCatelyn decides they must dissuade Robb from fighting at Harrenhal. Her uncle then tells her the worst part: Ser\\nStafford Lannister\\n is gathering a new host at Casterly Rock, though it will be made of sellswords and new recruits\\nwho require training. However, Lord Tywin is in no hurry and will wait patiently for his reinforcements. Then\\nCatelyn gets an idea: if they confront Lord Tywin with a new threat he might be forced leave Harrenhal. Her uncle\\n\\nnames Lord Renly, but Catelyn insist that they must call him \\nKing\\n Renly if they are to ask his help. The Blackfish\\nsmiles, but points out that Renly will want something in return. Catelyn replies that he will want what kings always\\nwant: homage.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn XI\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nJon I\\n ←\\nCatelyn I\\n→ \\nTyrion II\\n↓\\nCatelyn II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 8: Tyrion II\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion I\\n↑\\nCatelyn I\\n ←\\nTyrion II\\n→ \\nArya III\\n↓\\nTyrion III\\nTyrion\\n dines with Lord \\nJanos Slynt\\n.

Unlike Slynt,\\nTyrion has gone easy on the wine but certainly not the food, since one of his first acts as \\nHand\\n was to hire the finest\\ncook in the city. Slynt is very impressed with the food and says perhaps he will hire Tyrion’s cook to serve him at\\nHarrenhal\\n. Tyrion quips that wars have been fought over less.\\nTyrion declares Slynt a bold man to take a grim and allegedly cursed place like Harrenhal as his seat. Slynt\\ndismisses the superstition and insists it takes a bold man to rise as he and Tyrion have. Tyrion refills Slynt’s cup as\\nhe asks about Slynt’s list of proposed successors as Commander of the \\nCity Watch\\n. Slynt opines that he would\\nchoose \\nAllar Deem\\n, whom he describes as a good and loyal man. Tyrion says he is considering Ser \\nJacelyn Bywater\\n,\\na distinguished knight whose name does not appear on Slynt’s list. Slynt argues that Bywater is rigid and thinks\\novermuch of himself and his honor, insisting that Allar Deem is the one Tyrion wants. Tyrion remarks that Allar\\nDeem is little loved in the streets, but Slynt insists he is feared, which is better. Tyrion brings up that Deem killed a\\nyoung whore and her \\ninfant daughter\\n. Slynt explains that only the child was supposed to die, but the mother got in\\nthe way. He says he chose Deem because Deem is a hard man who always follows orders and never speaks of it\\nafterward. Tyrion asks who ordered Slynt to kill the whore’s bastard, but Slynt insists he prides himself on being as\\ntight-lipped as Allar Deem.\\nTyrion suggests that \\nJeor Mormont\\n, \\nLord Commander of the Night’s Watch\\n, could use men like Slynt and Deem,\\nbut Slynt responds that there is small chance of that. Tyrion points out that life takes queer turns, as it did with\\nEddard Stark\\n, who never imagined he would die on the steps of \\nBaelor’s Sept\\n. Slynt laughs that few did and\\nconfirms that even \\nVarys\\n was surprised. Slynt also confirms the execution was King \\nJoffrey\\n’s decision, and seems\\nconfused when Tyrion points out \\nCersei\\n planned to allow Stark to take the black.\\nTyrion comments on Slynt’s new bloody spear sigil, and asks if Slynt drove the spear into Eddard Stark’s back\\nhimself or if he only gave the command. Angered, Slynt insists Stark was a traitor who tried to buy him. Tyrion\\nreplies, “Little dreaming that you had already been sold.” Slynt declares he will not have his honor questioned, but\\nTyrion retorts that Slynt has no honor, though he does admit a spear thrust in the back is a good bargain for a\\nlordship and a castle. Slynt rises and demands what right Tyrion has to chastise him. Tyrion points out that Slynt\\nknows exactly who he is and should thank the gods he does not have to deal with Lord \\nTywin\\n instead.\\nTyrion declares Slynt’s two \\nyounger\\n \\nsons\\n will become squires and the \\neldest\\n will inherit his title and sufficient\\nlands, but not Harrenhal. Then Tyrion explains that the carrack \\nSummer\\'s Dream\\n will take Slynt to \\nthe Wall\\n, where\\nhe is to join the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n and give Tyrion’s regards to Lord Commander Mormont. Enraged, Slynt declares he\\n\\nhas powerful friends like King Joffrey, \\nLittlefinger\\n, and Queen Cersei; perhaps Tyrion will be the one banished to\\nthe Wall\\n.\\nAs Slynt throws open the door to leave, he comes face to face with Ser Jacelyn Bywater, whom Tyrion introduces as\\nthe new commander of the City Watch. As six gold cloaks usher Slynt away, Tyrion hands Slynt’s list of successors\\nto Bywater and asks him to see they accompany Slynt to \\nEastwatch-by-the-Sea\\n, adding that it would not be taken\\namiss if Allar Deem was swept overboard.\\nSoon after, Varys glides into the hall to praise Tyrion’s actions. Tyrion comments that he is tempted to do Varys the\\nsame as Deem. Varys replies that Tyrion might be disappointed: the storms come and go, but he keeps on paddling.\\nTyrion accuses the eunuch of concealing that Cersei sent gold cloaks to kill King \\nRobert\\n’s bastards. Varys asks\\nforgiveness, but Tyrion refuses, angry that he must make a show of punishing the likes of Slynt and Deem while his\\nsister continues on her savage course.\\nTyrion insists Varys tell him everything he knows from now on, but Varys only says he knows quite a lot. Tyrion\\npoints out Varys did not know enough to save the whore and her child. Varys says he took steps to save another\\nbastard, an \\nolder boy\\n, but assures Tyrion he never dreamed the baseborn daughter of a whore would be considered a\\nthreat. Tyrion remarks that being Robert’s was enough of a threat for Cersei. Varys blames himself, and comments\\nthat the whore loved King Robert. Thinking of \\nShae\\n and \\nTysha\\n, Tyrion wonders if a whore can truly love anyone.\\nHe recalls that, although he provided her with a rich manse and fine gifts, when he said Shae served him best\\nbetween the sheets it was not what she wanted to hear.\\nTyrion remarks that it seems Joffrey is truly to blame for Eddard Stark’s death, though Slynt and Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\ncarried out the sentence almost as if they expected it. Varys states that Tyrion can prevent further follies with the\\nsupport of the gold cloaks, but there are still Cersei’s household red cloaks to consider. Tyrion responds that they are\\nloyal to \\nCasterly Rock\\n and outnumbered by his \\nVale mountain clansmen\\n, not to mention six thousand gold cloaks if\\nBywater is the man Varys claims.\\nTyrion does not trust Varys, but cannot deny his usefulness. He asks Varys why he is so helpful and Varys replies,\\n“You are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you.” Tyrion asks, “As you served \\nJon Arryn\\n and Eddard\\nStark?” but Varys states he served as best he could, and he does not think Tyrion will share the same fate, since\\npower is a curious thing. Varys brings up the riddle he asked Tyrion \\nbefore\\n. Tyrion says the answer depends on the\\nsellsword\\n, who holds the power of life and death. Varys wonders aloud why men pretend kings hold power if this is\\ntrue. Tyrion points out that kings can call other swordsmen, but Varys only asks why these other swordsmen obey\\nrather than rule. Neither the godly \\nHigh Septon\\n, nor the lawful Queen Regent, nor the ever-knowledgeable Varys\\ncould prevent Eddard Stark’s death, so who truly killed him: Joffrey who gave the command, Ser Ilyn who swung\\nthe sword, or another? When Tyrion asks for the answer to the riddle, Varys declares that power resides where men\\nbelieve it resides. Tyrion asks if power is just a trick, and Varys agrees it is a shadow on the wall, though shadows\\ncan kill and often a very small man can cast a very large shadow.\\nTyrion smiles and declares he is growing fond of Varys, and though he may kill him yet he thinks he will feel sad\\nabout it. Varys declares he will take that as high praise. Tyrion asks what Varys is, but Varys only says he is a loyal\\nservant of the realm. Tyrion presses on to ask who made Varys a eunuch and who he \\ntruly\\n is. Varys’ smile never\\nflickers, but his eyes show a very different emotion as he insists his tale is long and sad.\\nVarys draws a parchment from his sleeve and reveals the master of the galley \\nWhite Hart\\n plans to defect to Lord\\nStannis\\n. Tyrion sighs that they should make an example of the man, which will serve both to discourage other\\ncaptains and to keep Joffrey busy. Next, Varys informs him Ser \\nHoras\\n and Ser \\nHobber Redwyne\\n have bribed a guard\\nand plan to escape on the \\nPentoshi\\n galley \\nMoonrunner\\n. Tyrion instructs Varys to have Bywater send the guard to the\\nNight’s Watch and post a guard on the \\nMoonrunner\\n just in case. Next, Varys notes that the clansman \\nTimett\\n killed a\\nman for cheating at tiles. When Varys confirms the man \\nwas\\n cheating, Tyrion declares Timett did all honest men a\\nfavor. Next, Varys explains that the \\nred comet\\n has brought all manner of prophets to the city to preach doom and\\ndestruction. Tyrion instructs Varys to let them rant. Finally, Varys states that when Lord \\nGyles Rosby\\n proposed a\\ntoast to the king, Ser \\nBalon Swann\\n remarked they would need three cups for that and many laughed. Tyrion insists\\nhe is not interested in treasonous table talk, which Varys calls wise.\\nTyrion returns to his solar to find \\nBronn\\n waiting. The sellsword asks about Slynt, and Tyrion admits he has likely\\n\\nreplaced one of Littlefinger’s men with one of Varys’. Tyrion asks how the recruiting is going, and Bronn explains\\nthat he only hires the sellswords who make a good impression in a duel. Tyrion asks if Bronn has killed any\\ncandidates, and Bronn answers, “No one we could have used.” Tyrion asks what should happen if one of them kills\\nBronn, but Bronn only says that man will be one Tyrion wants to hire. Tyrion asks Bronn if he would kill an infant\\ngirl without question when commanded. Bronn replies, “Without question? No. I’d ask how much.” Tyrion remarks\\nto himself that he does not need Slynt or Deem, since he has a hundred such men of his own. He wants to laugh or\\ncry, but most of all he wants Shae.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion I\\n↑\\nCatelyn I\\n ←\\nTyrion II\\n→ \\nArya III\\n↓\\nTyrion III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 9: Arya III\\nPlace(s): \\nSouth of the \\nGods Eye\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya II\\n↑\\nTyrion II\\n ←\\nArya III\\n→ \\nDavos I\\n↓\\nArya IV\\nArya\\n and the others have abandoned the \\nkingsroad\\n to avoid the \\ngold cloaks\\n. As they travel west they come upon a\\nburned village. When Arya goes to make water in the forest, she runs into a wolf pack, which scares her. She reports\\nthis to \\nYoren\\n, who laments they should have taken a ship instead.\\nSynopsis\\nThe road \\nArya\\n and the other travel is now little more than two ruts through the weeds and the human flood has\\nslowed to a trickle, so there is no one to say which way they go. However, the road wanders back and forth, tangles\\nwith other trails, and sometimes vanishes entirely. Arya hates it. The terrain is gentle enough, but even so the path is\\nnarrow enough that the wagons slow their pace to a crawl. A dozen times a day they must stop to free a wheel or\\ndouble up the teams to climb a muddy slope.\\nArya constantly looks over her shoulder, wondering when the \\ngold cloaks\\n will catch them. She does not trust their\\nsentries, especially the orphan boys, who seem lost out in the woods. Arya can sneak past any of them when she\\ngoes off in the night to make water alone. Once she snuck right up to \\nLommy Greenhands\\n and considered jumping\\non him, but changed her mind at the thought of \\nYoren\\n punishing her again.\\nThe orphans all treat \\nGendry\\n like someone special because the queen wants his head. Gendry will have none of it,\\nthough. He insists he was only an apprentice armorer until Master \\nTobho Mott\\n told him he was to join the \\nNight\\'s\\nWatch\\n. Then he goes off to polish his bull helm, but never wears it. Lommy guesses Gendry is the \"\\nwolf lord\\n\\'s\"\\nbastard, which angers Arya, who knows \\nJon Snow\\n is her father\\'s only bastard. She wishes she could ride home\\nalone, but she knows that would mean no one to scout ahead, watch behind, stand guard while she sleeps, and help\\nher fight off the gold cloaks.\\nYoren decides the \\nkingsroad\\n will not be safe until they cross the \\nTrident\\n, so they intend to travel around the west\\n(far) side of \\nGods Eye\\n. Settlements and farmland gives way to forest and the terrain grows rougher. Their provisions\\nsoon run out, so Yoren turns to the poachers \\nKoss\\n and \\nKurz\\n to range ahead to hunt, and the younger boys are set to\\npick berries and plunder orchards along the road. Arya is a skilled climber and a fast picker, and one day she comes\\nacross a rabbit, which Yoren stews. Everyone else gets a spoonful, but Arya gets a whole leg and shares it with\\nGendry.\\nAt \\nBriarwhite\\n, some fieldhands force them to pay for the sweetcorn they have taken. Yoren gives them some\\ncoppers, but complains that brothers of the Night\\'s Watch used to be feasted throughout the realm, even by high\\nlords. That night, Yoren is too angry to eat and only paces around the camp, muttering to himself. After that they\\nfind men guarding the fields more and more.\\nThe next day, Koss reports a camp of twenty or thirty men in mail and halfhelms armed with spears. Some of the\\nmen are wounded or dying and they have only one horse, which is lame. The soldiers carry a banner of a \\nspotted\\ntreecat\\n, which Yoren cannot identify. They go wide around the camp, since the men might be desperate enough to\\ntake their horses or worse. The detour costs them two days at least, but Yoren insists they will spend the rest of their\\nlives at \\nthe Wall\\n, so there is no rush to get there.\\n\\nOne evening, \\nDobber\\n spies a fire on the northern horizon. As night falls the fire seems to grow brighter until it looks\\nas if the whole north is ablaze. From time to time they can smell the smoke, but the wind holds steady and the\\nflames never get any closer. By morning the fire has burned out, but no one has slept very well.\\nIt is midday when they come upon the remains of a village. The fields are scorched for miles around and there are\\nburnt bodies everywhere. Leaving the rest to guard the wagons, Yoren takes \\nMurch\\n and \\nCutjack\\n to investigate the\\nruined holdfast. When Arya turns to Gendry he has his helmet on. After a long time, Yoren returns with a \\nlittle girl\\nand a woman whose right forearm is missing. The girl only cries and the woman only whimpers, \"Please,\" over and\\nover again. \\nRorge\\n thinks this is funny and he and \\nBiter\\n laugh until Murch curses them and tells them to shut up.\\nThey fix the woman a place in a wagon. \\nHot Pie\\n murmurs that he is scared and Arya admits she is too. Hot Pie\\nadmits he never actually kicked a boy to death, he just sold his mother\\'s pies. Arya rides as far ahead of the wagons\\nas she dares to get away from the little girl crying and the woman whispering. The one-armed woman dies at\\nevenfall, and Gendry and Cutjack bury her on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blows, Arya\\nthinks she can hear the tree\\'s branches whispering, \"Please,\" over and over, which frightens her badly.\\nThat night, Yoren orders no fire, so supper is sparse and Arya fills her belly with water instead. When she wakes it is\\npitch-black and her bladder is full to bursting. As she is leaving to make water, Hot Pie is on guard and insists Yoren\\nordered everyone to stay close. When Arya explains her need, Hot Pie tells her to use a nearby tree and explains that\\nhe heard wolves earlier. Rather than fight with him, Arya acts afraid and pretends to go back to sleep until Hot Pie\\nleaves, then sneaks into the woods on the other side of the camp. Just to make sure, she goes out twice as far as\\nusual. As she is doing her business, Arya hears a rustling and sees the eyes shining out from the wood. She grabs for\\nNeedle\\n and counts the eyes of a whole pack. One wolf comes forward and bares his teeth, but then retreats into the\\ndarkness and the wolves leave.\\nShe follows the sound of Yoren sharpening his knife back to camp. She climbs into the back of a wagon with him\\nand tells him there are wolves in the woods. Yoren is unperturbed, and comments that he thought Arya\\'s \\nkind\\n were\\nfond of wolves. Arya tells him about her \\ndirewolf\\n \\nNymeria\\n and how she was forced to drive her off. Yoren\\ncomments that the only wolves they have to fear are the human kind, like the ones who burned that village. He\\nwonders aloud if he should have left them all back in the city where it seems safer. Arya insists that she wants to go\\nhome. Yoren replies that he has been bringing men to the Wall for nearly thirty years and only lost three, but this\\ntime he should have taken a ship.\\nYoren tells Arya to get some sleep, and she tries, but she can hear the wolves howling, and fainter than that she\\nhears what might be screams.\\nNavigation:\\nArya II\\n↑\\nTyrion II\\n ←\\nArya III\\n→ \\nDavos I\\n↓\\nArya IV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 10: Davos I\\nPlace(s): \\nDragonstone\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya III\\n ←\\nDavos I\\n→ \\nTheon I\\n↓\\nDavos II\\nDavos Seaworth\\n watches the burning of the \\nSeven\\n. Entering the fire, \\nStannis Baratheon\\n draws out the sword\\nLightbringer\\n and \\nMelisandre\\n proclaims him \\nAzor Ahai\\n reborn. Later, Davos hears new of the war from the pirate\\nSalladhor Saan\\n, who insists Stannis\\' new sword is not the true Lightbringer. That night, Davos and Stannis discuss\\nhis plan to claim the \\nIron Throne\\n. When Davos asks why he supports Melisandre\\'s \\nforeign god\\n, Stannis explains that\\nhe means to discover Melisandre\\'s true power.\\nSynopsis\\nDavos Seaworth\\n is among the hundreds watching the statues of the \\nSeven\\n burn outside the gates of \\nDragonstone\\n. His\\nsons \\nAllard\\n and \\nDale\\n agree that it is an ill thing to burn the gods, but Davos cautions them that this is not the place.\\nThe red priestess \\nMelisandre\\n walks around the fire, praying in three tongues for \\nR\\'hllor\\n, the Lord of Light, to accept\\nthese false gods of the enemy and cast light upon them. The prayer ends with the sacred refrain, \"For the night is\\ndark and full of terrors.\" Queen \\nSelyse\\n echoes the words, but King \\nStannis\\n only watches impassively.\\nDragonstone\\'s sept was where \\nAegon I Targaryen\\n knelt to pray before he embarked upon his \\nconquest\\n, but that did\\nnot save it from the queen\\'s men. They overturned the altars, pulled down the statues, and smashed the stained glass.\\nDavos recalls that the statues were originally carved from the masts of the ships that carried the first \\nTargaryens\\nfrom \\nValyria\\n. \\nSepton\\n \\nBarre\\n could only curse them, but Ser \\nHubard Rambton\\n and his three sons slew four men before\\nthey were overwhelmed. Afterward, pious Lord \\nGuncer Sunglass\\n withdrew his support for Stannis and was\\nimprisoned along with the septon and Ser Hubard\\'s two surviving sons.\\nThough he has never been devout, the burning gods make Davos feel ill. Lord \\nArdrian Celtigar\\n coughs from the\\nsmoke and Lord \\nDuram Bar Emmon\\n turns grey, but Lord \\nMonford Velaryon\\n watches Stannis rather than the fire.\\nDavos wonders what Velaryon is thinking, but knows such a proud lord will never confide in him. The lords all\\nscorn Davos and his sons, but one day their grandsons will joust together. In time Davos imagines his sigil will fly\\nas high as theirs, but only if Stannis wins his throne, since everything Davos is he owes to Stannis. It was Stannis\\nwho gave Davos his knighthood and his war galley \\nBlack Betha\\n. His sons Dale and Allard captain ships of their\\nown, \\nMaric\\n is oarmaster on the \\nFury\\n, \\nMatthos\\n serves as Davos\\' mate, \\nDevan\\n is a royal squire who will one day be a\\nknight, and his two \\nyoungest\\n \\nsons\\n will one day be knights as well. His wife \\nMarya\\n is mistress of a small keep, and\\nDavos can hunt deer in his own woods. All this he has of Stannis for the price of a few finger joints, taken as just\\npunishment for flaunting the law all his life. As he thinks back, Davos touches the pouch around his neck where he\\nkeeps his finger bones for luck; they will all need luck soon.\\nMelisandre recounts an ancient prophecy that at the end of a long summer, when the stars bleed and darkness falls\\nover world, \\nAzor Ahai\\n will be reborn and draw the burning sword \\nLightbringer\\n from the fire and destroy the\\ndarkness. Then she calls upon Azor Ahai to claim his sword and Stannis marches forward. His squires, Devan\\nSeaworth and \\nBryen Farring\\n, equip him with a padded glove and leather cape. Using the cape to ward off the flames,\\nStannis plunges into the fire and draws out a near-molten sword from the statue of the \\nMother\\n. Queen Selyse and her\\nqueen\\'s men chant praises, and Melisandre names the sword Lightbringer and declares Stannis Azor Ahai come\\nagain. The cherry-red sword is burning his glove, so Stannis thrusts it into the dirt.\\nMelisandre calls upon R\\'hllor to cast light upon them, and Selyse and the queen\\'s men reply that the night is dark\\nand full of terrors. Then Melisandre sings a song in the \\nAsshai\\n\\'i language until only charwood remains of the gods.\\nImpatient, Stannis escorts his queen back into Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer in the dirt for his squires to collect.\\n\\nDavos notes that the burnt and blackened Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess. A few lords linger, speaking\\nquietly, but they fall silent when they see Davos looking at them. Davos knows that these lords will pull him down if\\nStannis should fall, but neither will he court the favor of Queen Selyse by giving himself to this new Lord of Light.\\nWhen the fire starts to dwindle, Melisandre and the squires depart with the sword, and Davos and his sons join the\\ncrowd headed for the harbor. Davos comments that Devan did well as the king\\'s squire. Allard asks why the king\\'s\\nsquires wore \\nfiery heart\\n sigils in place of the \\ncrowned stag\\n. Davos points out that a lord can choose more than one\\nbadge. Allard insists that it was an ill thing to burn the Seven. Davos asks when Allard grew so devout and what a\\nsmuggler\\'s son would know of the gods\\' doings. Allard insists he is a knight\\'s son and asks why the lords should\\nremember Davos is a knight if he does not himself. Davos points out that Allard will never be a knight if he meddles\\nin affairs that do not concern him; it is not for them to question their rightful king. His sons do not like to recall they\\nwere lowborn, and when they look at \\nHouse Seaworth\\n\\'s sigil they see only the black ship and close their eyes to the\\nonion.\\nIn the extremely crowded port, Davos enters an inn, where he finds the flamboyant \\nLysene\\n pirate \\nSalladhor Saan\\neating grapes. A friend and business partner from his smuggling days, it was Davos who recruited Saan to Stannis\\'\\ncause. When Davos asks why he did not attend the burning, Salladhor explains that such sights are common in Lys.\\nThey bore him, and hopefully they will soon bore Stannis.\\nSalladhor explains that one of his \\ntrading ships\\n arrived from \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n with news that \\nTyrion Lannister\\n is now\\noverseeing the capital and has driven out \\nJanos Slynt\\n as commander of the \\nCity Watch\\n. Davos asks how well the city\\nis defended. Saan replies that the walls are strong, but defended only by the gold cloaks, who are too few and\\ninexperienced. He urges a swift strike to take the city, and then Tyrion could be dressed as a fool and Queen \\nCersei\\ncould warm his bed for a night as part of his payment. Davos assures Salladhor he will be paid, but the pirate insists\\nhe wants gold, not words. Davos promises there is gold in the treasury at King\\'s Landing, and Stannis is the most\\nhonorable man in the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n.\\nSalladhor again urges an attack on the capital, but Davos asks how long they could hold it with \\nTywin Lannister\\n and\\nRenly Baratheon\\n against them. Saan reveals Renly has left \\nHighgarden\\n with his army and his \\nnew queen\\n to march\\non King\\'s Landing. That Renly brought his bride along surprises Davos; it suggests either great love or great\\nconfidence. Davos declares that Stannis must be told, but Salladhor has already done so, though Stannis seems to\\ndisapprove of the pirate.\\nAbruptly, Salladhor claims Stannis\\' sword is not the true Lightbringer and asks how a burnt sword will serve\\nStannis. Davos corrects that it is a \\nburning\\n sword, but Saan insists it is burnt. He recounts the legend of how, after\\ntwo failed attempts, Azor Ahai labored a hundred days and nights on a hero\\'s blade to oppose darkness. Then he\\ntempered the sword in his wife \\nNissa Nissa\\n\\'s heart and her blood, soul, courage, and strength went into the steel to\\ncreate Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes. Salladhor tells Davos to be thankful the sword Stannis raised is not\\nreal because, \"Too much light can hurt the eyes, and fire burns.\"\\nSalladhor asks when Stannis will sail, and Davos replies that it depends on the will of the king\\'s new god. Salladhor\\nasks who Davos\\' god is. Cautious of his surroundings, Davos replies that his god is King Stannis, who made him and\\nblessed him with trust. Salladhor says he will remember and excuses himself, declaring they will soon feast in the\\nRed Keep. He also asks Davos to remind Stannis he will owe another 30,000 dragons come the black of the moon,\\ncommenting that the statues they burnt might have brought a noble price. He jokes that if Stannis grants him Queen\\nCersei for a night he shall forgive him.\\nDavos lingers in the inn, thinking of Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword, though there was no true magic in that\\nsword. A true sword of fire would be a wonder, but when he thinks of Nissa Nissa it is his own wife Marya he\\npictures, and he decides the price is more than he cares to pay.\\nAfter dark, Devan arrives with a summons from King Stannis. When Davos arrives, the important bannermen are\\nleaving. Ser \\nAxell Florent\\n, the foremost of the queen\\'s men, asks what Davos thought of the burning gods and\\nexplains he saw a vision of the glory awaiting Stannis when they take King\\'s Landing. Davos replies that all he saw\\nwas fire and pushes past, wondering why Ser Axell bothered, since Davos is the king\\'s man as much as Axell is the\\nqueen\\'s.\\n\\nDavos finds Stannis seated at the Painted Table with \\nMaester\\n \\nPylos\\n. Stannis commands Davos to have a look at his\\nletter. Davos obediently selects a paper before pointing out that he is illiterate. Mildly irritated, Stannis commands\\nMaester Pylos to read the letter instead:\\nAll men know me for the trueborn son of \\nSteffon Baratheon\\n, Lord of Storm’s End, by his lady wife \\nCassana\\n of\\nHouse Estermont\\n. I declare upon the honor of my House that my beloved brother \\nRobert\\n, our late king, left no\\ntrueborn issue of his body, the boy \\nJoffrey\\n, the boy \\nTommen\\n, and the girl \\nMyrcella\\n being abominations born of\\nincest between \\nCersei Lannister\\n and her brother \\nJaime\\n the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day\\nlay claim to the \\nIron Throne\\n of the Seven Kingdoms of \\nWesteros\\n. Let all true men declare their loyalty. Done in\\nthe Light of the Lord, under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the\\nAndals, the \\nRhoynar\\n, and the \\nFirst Men\\n, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\\nStannis orders Pylos to add \"Ser\" to Jaime\\'s name since he is still a knight, and to remove \"beloved brother\" since it\\nis a lie. Then he declares all of their 117 ravens will be used to carry copies across the realm, though most will likely\\nbe burnt by lords who support the other kings even though Stannis is their rightful king. Therefore, Stannis orders\\nDavos to sail north as far as \\nWhite Harbor\\n while his son Dale sails south as far as \\nthe Arbor\\n. They are to post the\\ndeclaration in every port and fishing village they pass for every man who can to read. Davos points out that few\\nsmallfolk can read and requests knights to read the declarations aloud. Stannis agrees, since he has a hundred\\nknights who would rather read than fight. He plans to send Allard across the \\nnarrow sea\\n to carry the declaration to\\nthe \\nFree Cities\\n as well, so that all the world will know of his claim and Cersei\\'s infamy.\\nAfter Stannis dismisses Pylos, Davos asks what the lords thought of the letter. Stannis snorts that they all flattered\\nhim except Velaryon, who said steel would decide the matter as if Stannis never suspected as much. Stannis curses\\nhis lords and asks Davos for the truth. Davos declares the words blunt and strong, but reminds Stannis they still have\\nno firm proof of incest. Stannis replies there is proof of a sort at \\nStorm\\'s End\\n: \\nRobert\\n\\'s acknowledged bastard \\nEdric\\nStorm\\n is the very image of Robert, yet his supposed sons \\nJoffrey\\n and \\nTommen\\n look nothing like him. Davos reminds\\nStannis that they cannot reach Edric at Storm\\'s End.\\nDavos also suggests removing the reference to the Lord of Light from the letter in favor of a something less specific.\\nWhen Stannis asks if he has become devout, Davos says he does not know this new god but knew the ones they\\nburned. Stannis argues that it was only wood they burned, but Davos mentions that charitable septons would feed\\nhim when he was a begging boy. Davos explains that the people will not love Stannis if he takes away their familiar\\ngods and gives them a foreign one. Stannis replies that the people have never loved him.\\nGazing out the window, Stannis declares he stopped believing in gods the day he saw the \\nWindproud\\n break up on\\nShipbreaker Bay\\n, refusing to worship any gods monstrous enough to drown his parents. The \\nHigh Septon\\n always\\nprattles about justice and goodness flowing from the gods, but Stannis insists all he ever saw of either was made by\\nmen. Davos asks why Stannis would trouble with a new god if he does not believe. Stannis answers that, god or no\\ngod, Melisandre has power. Davos replies that Maester \\nCressen\\n had wisdom, but Stannis argues that Cressen\\'s wise\\nadvice did no good: the \\nstorm lords\\n laughed when he went begging. Stannis declares there will be no more begging\\nor laughing. The Iron Throne is rightfully his, but of the four kings he has the fewest men and the least gold. His\\nonly assets are his ships and the red woman. Stannis asks if Davos knows that half his men are afraid to even speak\\nher name; a sorceress who can inspire such dread is not to be despised, and he means to find out if she can do more.\\nStannis recalls that as a boy he nursed an injured goshawk named \\nProudwing\\n, who would follow him about and eat\\nfrom his hand but would not hunt. Finally, his great-uncle Ser \\nHarbert\\n told him, rightly, that he should try a different\\nbird because he was embarrassing himself. Stannis turns back to Davos and declares that the Seven have never\\nbrought him so much as a sparrow. It is time he tried another hawk, a red hawk.\\nNavigation:\\nArya III\\n ←\\nDavos I\\n→ \\nTheon I\\n↓\\nDavos II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 11: Theon I\\nPlace(s): \\nAboard the \\nMyraham\\n, \\nLordsport\\n and \\nPyke\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDavos I\\n ←\\nTheon I\\n→ \\nDaenerys I\\n↓\\nTheon II\\nAfter an absence of ten years, \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n arrives back home on the island \\nPyke\\n aboard the \\nMyraham\\n. He docks\\nat \\nLordsport\\n and is disappointed to discover that his father, Lord \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n, has send only Theon’s uncle \\nAeron\\n,\\na priest of the \\nDrowned God\\n, to escort him to \\nBalon’s castle\\n. At Pyke, Theon is greeted coldly by his father, after\\nwhich he presents Balon with \\nRobb Stark\\n’s letter. Balon rejects the proposed alliance with Robb, instead insisting\\nthat he will \\npay the iron price\\n and carve out a kingdom of his own.\\nSynopsis\\nTheon Greyjoy\\n is aboard the \\nMyraham\\n, which is taking him to \\nhis father\\'s\\n \\ncastle\\n on \\nPyke\\n. Although there is no safe\\nanchorage, Theon insists the \\nMyraham\\n pass by the castle so he can watch his home rise just as it dwindled when he\\nwas taken away as a ward of \\nEddard Stark\\n ten years before. Theon is unable to make out the banner above the \\nSea\\nTower\\n, but he knows it is the golden kraken of \\nHouse Greyjoy\\n. In the sky beyond the castle, the \\nred comet\\n is still\\nvisible. Theon decides it is his comet, sliding a hand to the letter from \\nRobb Stark\\n that he considers as good as a\\ncrown. The \\ncaptain\\'s daughter\\n asks Theon if the castle is as he remembers it and he confesses it looks smaller. He\\nthen gives the captain permission to make for port at \\nLordsport\\n and takes the girl below deck, where he has her\\nsatisfy him orally. The girl asks to come ashore with him, to be his \\nsalt wife\\n, but Theon rebuffs her, explaining that\\nthe days of the \\nOld Way\\n are gone and that her place is on the \\nMyraham\\n, despite her protests that her father will hit\\nher for having slept with Theon.\\nIn the harbor of Lordsport, Theon notices at least fifty or sixty longships including those of Houses \\nGoodbrother\\n,\\nWynch\\n, and \\nHarlaw\\n. Theon considers why his father has called the banners, wondering whether it is because of\\ncaution, or whether Lord Balon had anticipated as to why Theon was finally coming home after all these years.\\nFrom aboard the ship, Theon discovers there is no honor guard to escort him to Pyke. As they make port the captain\\nof the Myraham announces him, but the waiting merchants are unimpressed and do not recognize him. He orders a\\nhorse from an innkeeper, but their conversation is interrupted by a priest of the \\nDrowned God\\n, who says he will\\nescort his nephew to Balon\\'s castle. Theon does not recognize the grim, bearded priest until he remembers his father\\nwriting that his uncle \\nAeron Greyjoy\\n had gone down in a storm and turned holy after the near-death experience.\\nTheon finds that Aeron\\'s cold manners are totally unlike the amiable man he remembers from his youth. Abruptly,\\nAeron asks if Theon prays to the \\nStark\\n \\ngods\\n now, and Theon (who seldom prays at all) says no. Aeron commands\\nhim to kneel in the mud and drenches his head with seawater from a waterskin, reconsecrating him to the Drowned\\nGod.\\nAeron informs Theon that his \\nmother\\n now lives on \\nHarlaw\\n because of her health and his sister \\nAsha\\n has taken her\\nship, \\nBlack Wind\\n, to \\nGreat Wyk\\n with messages from her father. Theon asks why his father has assembled his forces,\\nbut Aeron insists Balon commanded secrecy. When Theon protests, stating he has a right to know as Balon\\'s heir,\\nAeron replies \"\\nwe shall see\\n\" to that, stating that, although Balon has no other sons but Theon, he does have a\\ndaughter. When Theon furiously replies that he will not allow himself to be cheated out of his birthright by a\\nwoman, Aeron comments that Theon is a fool if he believes that Balon will ever hand over the \\nIron Islands\\n to a\\nStark, making Theon realize that, although he was never truly accepted by the Starks, he is now neither truly\\naccepted by his own family, either.\\nThey reach Pyke at sunset, from where Aeron departs immediately. Theon is brought to his chambers by \\nHelya\\n, who\\ninforms him that Balon awaits him atop the Sea Tower. Theon dresses richly before leaving to meet his father. Balon\\nis smaller, gaunter, and greyer than Theon remembers him. Balon asks what Theon is now, and Theon replies he is a\\n\\nman and Balon\\'s heir. Balon only says they will see. Balon criticizes Theon\\'s clothing and asks if the gold chain\\naround his neck was bought with iron or gold. Theon, recalling that the \\nOld Way\\n stipulates a warrior may only wear\\njewelry taken from enemies he has slain, has to admit the chain was bought with \\ngold\\n. Balon yanks the chain off\\nTheon\\'s neck, declaring that \\nhis daughter\\n has taken an axe for a lover and that he will not have his son dress like a\\nwhore. Balon accuses Theon of having grown weak due to the green lands and decides the Starks have made Theon\\ntheirs, calling Theon \\nRobb Stark\\n\\'s envoy. Theon claims the letter of Robb he carries was based on Theon\\'s own\\ncounsel, which amuses Balon. However, when Theon tells Balon that Robb looks upon him \"as an older brother\",\\nBalon grows angry.\\nTheon hands his father the letter, but it fails to impress Balon. In the letter, Robb offers Balon a crown in return for\\nhaving the ironborn attacking the \\nwesterlands\\n, specifically \\nLannisport\\n and \\nCasterly Rock\\n. Theon tells Balon the\\nproposed plan is his own and asks for his reward Casterly Rock as his own seat. Balon scoffs at the notion of\\nreceiving such handsome reward for \"a notion and a few lines of scribbling\" and shows his dislike for the notion that\\nRobb will give him a crown, as \"what is given can be taken away\". Balon burns the letter and backhands Theon\\nwhen he protests. Balon declares that he will pay the iron price for his crown and take it by conquest as \\nUrron\\nRedhand\\n did five thousand years before. However, Balon feels Casterly Rock to be too strongly defended and Lord\\nTywin Lannister\\n to be too cunning by half. Theon asks what kingdom Balon means to carve out instead, but realizes\\nhe already knows \\nthe answer\\n.\\nNavigation:\\nDavos I\\n ←\\nTheon I\\n→ \\nDaenerys I\\n↓\\nTheon II\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 12: Daenerys I\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nRed Waste\\n - \\nVaes Tolorro\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys X\\nA Game of Thrones\\n↑\\nTheon I\\n ←\\nDaenerys I\\n→ \\nJon II\\n↓\\nDaenerys II\\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n decides to follow the \\nred comet\\n deep into the \\nred waste\\n to protect her newborn \\ndragons\\n. Many\\nof her \\nkhalasar\\n die before they find shelter in a \\nruined city\\n. There, Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n tells her about his second\\nwife, \\nLynesse Hightower\\n. While her people rest, Daenerys sends her three \\nbloodriders\\n to scout, and \\nJhogo\\n returns\\nwith three strangers from the great city of \\nQarth\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n commands her small \\nkhalasar\\n to follow the \\nred comet\\n the \\nDothraki\\n have named \\nshierak qiya\\n,\\nthe Bleeding Star. The old men mutter that it is a bad omen, but it appeared the \\nnight\\n they cremated her husband\\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n and hatched her \\ndragons\\n, so Daenerys considers it the herald of her coming. Her handmaid \\nDoreah\\nexplains that only the grim and terrible \\nred lands\\n lie in that direction, but Daenerys really has no choice. The other\\nkhalasars\\n hold sway to the north, the \\nLhazareen\\n to the south, and Khal \\nPono\\n is driving slaves west to \\nSlaver\\'s Bay\\n.\\nWhen Daenerys argues that Pono always spoke to her kindly, Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n reminds her that Pono was the first\\nto leave and will kill her now. She argues that she has dragons, but Jorah explains that the hatchlings would be easy\\nto kill, though Pono is more likely to seize them, since a living dragon is priceless. Daenerys makes it clear they are\\nhers and will never be taken while she lives, but Jorah insists she will not live long unless she goes where no one\\nelse does. Mounted on her \\nsilver mare\\n and garbed in her white \\nhrakkar\\n pelt to cover her bald head, Daenerys\\ncommands her people to follow the comet and no words are raised against it; she is the Unburnt and Mother of\\nDragons, so her word is their law.\\nThey ride by night, leaving a trail of dead horses because Pono, \\nJhaqo\\n, and the others have taken the best mounts.\\nHer people are also the weak and unwanted, so Daenerys must project confidence and strength to encourage them.\\nThree days into the march, the weakest of her people start to die.\\nThere is little forage and less water in the red waste. When supplies run low, they are forced to live on horseflesh\\nand the deaths increase. Daenerys suffers with her people; she sheds much weight and her milk dries up so she\\ncannot breastfeed her dragons. They will not eat the meat she tries to feed them until she remembers her brother\\nViserys\\n saying that only men and dragons eat cooked meat. From then on, the dragons devour several times their\\nown weight in seared meat every day and begin to prosper.\\nEach night, Daenerys lets one of the dragons ride on her shoulder, while \\nIrri\\n and \\nJhiqui\\n carry the other two in a cage\\nslung between their horses. One day, \\nAggo\\n says her black dragon is \\nBalerion\\n reborn. Daenerys recalls that her\\nancestor \\nAegon I Targaryen\\n\\'s dragons were named after the gods of Old \\nValyria\\n, but decides to name hers after\\nthose the gods have taken from her. She names the green-and-bronze one \\nRhaegal\\n after her brother \\nRhaegar\\nTargaryen\\n, the cream-and-gold one \\nViserion\\n after her brother Viserys, and the black-and-scarlet one \\nDrogon\\n after\\nher husband Drogo.\\nYet even as her dragons prosper, her \\nkhalasar\\n withers. Some are forced to walk because there are no longer enough\\nhorses to go around. Doreah, who has been ill for a while, develops a fever and finally grows too weak to mount her\\nhorse. Daenerys stops the \\nkhalasar\\n and personally cares for the girl who taught her how to seduce Khal Drogo,\\nholding her hand until she finally dies.\\n\\nAs the environment continues to worsen, the Dothraki begin to fear the comet has led them to some hell, and even\\nDaenerys begins to despair. She goes to Ser Jorah to ask if the waste has an end. He assures her it does end, though\\nthe way is harder than he dared to think. Daenerys notes that the knight is still suffering from the wound he took\\nfighting\\n \\nQotho\\n, but he still urges their only choice is to press on.\\nA few days later, her outriders return with news of a city that even Ser Jorah can tell her nothing about. She sends\\nher \\nbloodriders\\n Aggo, \\nJhogo\\n, and \\nRakharo\\n to scout the city. When they report that the city is dead, Jhiqui insists that\\nsuch places are haunted by ghosts and best avoided. This does not dissuade Daenerys, and she leads her \\nkhalasar\\ninto the deserted city. Inside, Daenerys passes an empty plinth and wonders if its statue now stands in \\nVaes Dothrak\\n.\\nThey find fruit trees and fresh water, but also bones. Irri mutters about ghosts, but Daenerys assures her dragons are\\nmore powerful, though food, water, and fodder are more important. After Daenerys settles into her tent and bathes in\\nsand, Ser Jorah arrives to give her a peach, which she savors. She declares that the gods were good to lead them to\\nthis place, and Jorah replies that they should rest and gather their strength.\\nDaenerys mentions that her handmaids worry about ghosts, but the knight points out there are ghosts everywhere.\\nDaenerys remembers those she has lost and asks the name of Ser Jorah\\'s ghost. He names his second wife, the\\nbeautiful \\nLynesse Hightower\\n. When Daenerys presses for more information, Jorah explains that his home on the\\nremote \\nBear Island\\n is cold and rustic. His first wife, a \\nGlover\\n, whom he loved after a fashion, died from her third\\nmiscarriage after ten years of marriage. Soon after, he fought in the \\nGreyjoy Rebellion\\n and earned his knighthood\\nwhen he followed \\nThoros of Myr\\n through the breach at \\nPyke\\n. Afterward, King \\nRobert\\n held a tourney outside\\nLannisport\\n, where Jorah met Lynesse and held \\nJaime Lannister\\n to a draw in the final joust, earning the champion\\'s\\nlaurel and naming Lynesse queen of love and beauty. That night, drunk on wine and victory, he asked Lord \\nLeyton\\nHightower\\n for his daughter\\'s hand, and they were married there in Lannisport. However, Bear Island was a\\ndisappointment to Lynesse. Jorah went to great expense to import what she wanted, and when that failed he entered\\ntourneys but never distinguished himself again. Each loss cost a suit of armor and a charger, and soon he was broke.\\nLynesse was unwilling to give up her jewels, so Jorah did shameful things for gold. When he heard \\nEddard Stark\\nwas coming to punish him, he fled with his wife to \\nLys\\n. In half a year, their money was gone and he was forced to\\nbecome a \\nsellsword\\n, and while he was away fighting, Lynesse moved in with the merchant prince \\nTregar Ormollen\\n.\\nWhen Daenerys asks, Jorah explains that he hates Lynesse almost as much as he loves her. As Jorah is leaving,\\nDaenerys asks what Lynesse looked like, and Jorah replies that she looked a lot like her.\\nAfter he leaves, Daenerys realizes Ser Jorah loves her and wants her, not as a queen but as a woman. She tries to\\nimage herself with him, but it is no good. She also noticed his longing to return to Bear Island. He can never have\\nher, but she hopes one day to give him back his home and his honor. That night she dreams of riding dragons with\\nDrogo.\\nThe next morning, she calls her bloodriders and orders them each to take three healthy horses and plenty of supplies\\nto go scouting: Aggo to the southwest, Rakharo to the south, and Jhogo to the southeast. While they wait for the\\nbloodriders to return to the city (which they name \\nVaes Tolorro\\n) the \\nkhalasar\\n has a chance to recover, and Daenerys\\ntends to Ser Jorah\\'s hip wound, which finally starts to heal.\\nRakharo returns first to report the wasteland stretches south all the way to the ocean. Daenerys puts him in charge of\\npulling up the plaza so more grass might grow for the horses. Aggo returns next, having found only two deserted\\ncities smaller than Vaes Tolorro. Daenerys sets him to work repairing the city gates. Jhogo is the last to return, much\\nlater, bringing three queerly garbed strangers from the great city of \\nQarth\\n: the great warlock \\nPyat Pree\\n, the merchant\\nprince \\nXaro Xhoan Daxos\\n of the \\nThirteen\\n, and \\nQuaithe\\n of the Shadow.

After a\\nshort talk with Sam, Jon returns to Mormont to discuss how \\nhis uncle\\n might have reacted to the abandoned villages.\\nSynopsis\\nThe abandoned village of \\nWhitetree\\n is dominated by the largest tree \\nJon Snow\\n has ever seen. The \\nweirwood\\n shades\\nthe entire village beneath its canopy, but the size does not disturb Jon as much as the face, whose jagged mouth is\\nlarge enough to swallow a sheep and contains human bones. \\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n notes that the tree is old,\\nand Jon adds that it is powerful as well.\\nThoren Smallwood\\n declares he now understands why the men feared the \\nheart trees\\n when they first came to\\nWesteros\\n and cut them down. Jon replies that \\nhis father\\n claimed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree, and\\nMormont agrees his father said the same. Mormont asks Jon to retrieve the blackened skull from the ashes. When he\\nreaches in, Jon finds another skull under it. As he examines the skull, Mormont wishes he had asked why the\\nwildlings burn their dead when there were still a few around to ask. Jon remembers the \\nwight\\n he fought and is\\ncertain he knows the reason.\\nMusing on what they might learn if bones could talk, Mormont orders the houses searched. Jon is paired with\\nEddison Tollett\\n, nicknamed Dolorous Edd. As they search, Dolorous Edd says the dead walking is bad enough, but\\nnow Mormont wants them talking, too. The grey-haired squire adds that the dead might lie, or be full of tedious\\ncomplaints. Entering one of the houses, Jon notes the dirt floor and lack of furnishing and calls it is a dismal place to\\nlive. Dolorous Edd replies that he was born in such a house, but then fell on hard times.\\nThey find nothing, as expected. Whitetree is the fourth village they have searched and each has been as empty.\\nWhen Jon asks what he thinks happened here, Dolorous Edd responds he does not want to imagine. Reemerging,\\nthey find \\nChett\\n using the hounds to search and cursing angrily. When Jon meets Chett\\'s eyes, he can tell there is no\\nlove lost between them. Thoren Smallwood, dressed in the late Ser \\nJaremy Rykker\\n\\'s armor and cloak and looking\\nmore lordly than Mormont, declares there were wildlings here a year ago. \\nJarman Buckwell\\n replies that much can\\nchange in a year. Ser \\nMallador Locke\\n opines that fewer wildlings means fewer worries. Then \\nBedwyck\\n, a five-foot\\nranger known as Giant, descends from the giant tree to report a lake to the north and low hill to the west. With three\\nhours of daylight left, Mormont decides to head for the lake to make camp.\\nAfter writing a report to \\nMaester Aemon\\n, the Lord Commander sends Jon to find \\nSamwell Tarly\\n to send the\\nmessage. Jarman Buckwell\\'s scouts ride out first, followed by Thoren Smallwood\\'s vanguard, Mormont\\'s main force,\\nthe baggage train under Ser Mallador Locke, and finally the rear guard under Ser \\nOttyn Wythers\\n; a total of 200 men\\nand 300 horses. As he rides, Jon exercises his scarred fingers to keep his sword hand from growing stiff and clumsy.\\nHe is likely to need his sword hand \\nbeyond the Wall\\n, especially now. The black brothers left \\nCastle Black\\n in good\\nspirits, but the silence of the wood has unnerved them all. Not only have the wildlings disappeared, but the game as\\nwell. Even the veteran rangers agree the \\nhaunted forest\\n has never seemed so haunted.\\nHe finds Sam watering the horses who carry the raven cages. A few of the ravens\\' shrieks sound like words, and Jon\\n\\nasks if Sam is teaching them to speak. Sam explains three of them to say \"snow.\" Jon comments that \\none bird\\ncroaking his name was enough. When Sam asks about Whitetree, Jon gives him Mormont\\'s report. Sam dispatches a\\nraven with the message, lamenting that he wishes it could carry him back as well. When Jon asks about him still\\nbeing afraid, Sam admits he is not as frightened as he was. At first he could not sleep for fearing every noise was a\\nwildling creeping up to kill him, but now he knows there are no wildlings around. Jon remarks to himself that two\\nhundred brave men left \\nthe Wall\\n and only Sam, the self-confessed coward, is growing less afraid.\\nSam says he is sore from the rough living, but he is working on his maps. Jon jokingly threatens to volunteer Sam as\\nan outrider, which Sam emphatically protests. Sam then admits he hoped they would stay in the village under a roof.\\nJon points out that their are not enough houses for everyone and rides off again.\\nGhost\\n, who has been hunting well away from the line of march, appears as Jon is swinging wide of the village to\\navoid the congested column. The white wolf has been having no more luck than the foragers. Jon remembers telling\\nDywen\\n that their numbers were probably frightening away the game, but Dywen only agreed the game was being\\nfrightened by \\nsomething\\n.\\nWhen Jon rejoins Mormont, he mentions that Sam is teaching the ravens to talk. Mormont snorts that he will regret\\nthat, as they make a lot of noise but say nothing worth hearing. They ride in silence for a while before Jon comments\\non what his uncle \\nBenjen\\n would make of the empty villages. Mormont continues Jon\\'s thought that Benjen would\\nhave pushed on to find out why, and perhaps someone or something did not want that known. Mormont declares that\\nwhen \\nQhorin Halfhand\\n joins them, they will be 300 men and not so easy for an enemy to deal with. He promises Jon\\nthat they will find them, but Jon wonders if they will be found instead.\\nNavigation:\\nJon I\\n↑\\nDaenerys I\\n ←\\nJon II\\n→ \\nArya IV\\n↓\\nJon III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 14: Arya IV\\nPlace(s): \\nRiver\\n and \\ntown\\n south of the \\nGods Eye\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya III\\n↑\\nJon II\\n ←\\nArya IV\\n→ \\nTyrion III\\n↓\\nArya V\\nArya\\n and the others decide to spend the night in the holdfast of an \\nabandoned town\\n on the southern shores of the\\nGods Eye\\n.

As the battle turns against them, Yoren orders Arya to get the survivors out through an\\nescape tunnel in the burning barn. Before escaping Arya throws an axe to the three criminals trapped in their wagon.\\nSynopsis\\nThe river\\n seems a peaceful place to \\nArya\\n until \\nKoss\\n finds a soldier decomposing in the reeds. \\nYoren\\n sends \\nDobber\\n to\\nsearch the body for valuables and, finding they cannot cross, he takes Koss upriver and sends \\nWoth\\n and \\nGerren\\ndownriver to look for a ford.

Drawing a map in the mud, Yoren explains that the river\\nflows south from the \\nGods Eye\\n. With no way to cross the river without abandoning the wagons, they cannot pass\\nalong the lake\\'s western shore as planned, and going east will bring them back to the \\nkingsroad\\n. Yoren decides to go\\nnorth to where the river meets the lake, sell all they have to hire a boat in \\nthe town\\n there, and sail across the lake to\\nHarrentown\\n. There they can buy new mounts or take refuge at \\nHarrenhal\\n, the seat of Lady \\nShella Whent\\n, a known\\nfriend of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n.\\nHot Pie worries about ghosts at Harrenhal, but Yoren only spits. Arya recalls \\nOld Nan\\n\\'s stories about Evil King\\nHarren\\n and how \\nAegon\\n unleashed his \\ndragons\\n to turn the castle into a pyre. Old Nan told that fiery spirits still haunt\\nthe castle and sometimes men who sleep there are found burnt alive in the morning, but Arya does not believe the\\nstories. It will be knights at Harrenhal, not ghosts, and she can reveal herself to Lady Whent and maybe be escorted\\nhome.\\nThey pass abandoned cottages and untended fields to find the town deserted as well, which frightens Arya when she\\nwonders what scared the people away. Growing apprehensive, Yoren leaves ten recruits to guard the wagons and\\nsplits the rest up to search the town while he investigates the towerhouse. \\nWoth\\n once pulled an oar on a galley, so\\nYoren orders him to take Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy to search for boats.\\nThe docks are empty except for a rotten rowboat, and Arya realizes the people took all the boats when they fled.\\nLommy and Hot Pie suggest they search a nearby inn for food and ale, but Woth insists on sticking to Yoren\\'s\\norders. Despondent, Arya washes her face in the lake and wonders if she could swim all the way to \\nWinterfell\\n. Woth\\nshouts at her to help search, so she does, but they only find some sails and nails.\\nIt is dark when Yoren returns to report the towerhouse empty. He dismisses suggestions of patching the rowboat or\\nbuilding a new one, but he is intrigued by Gendry\\'s idea of a raft. However, a raft would mean leaving the wagons\\nand staying close to shore, so Yoren decides to sleep on it. Lommy asks if they can stay at the inn, but Yoren\\nchooses the holdfast for its protective wall. Arya argues they should not stay at all since even the lord ran away.\\nLommy mocks her as scared, but Yoren declares her reasoning smart, except the Night\\'s Watch takes no part and\\nnobody is their enemy. Arya thinks that nobody is their friend either, but she remains silent to avoid seeming craven.\\n\\nThe holdfast is surrounded by a ten-foot wall of rough-cut stone with iron bars to brace the front gate. Besides the\\nmain gate, there is a postern to the north and a narrow tunnel that leads to the lakeshore hidden under the barn.\\nYoren has them park a wagon on the trap door to make sure nobody enters that way. He also assigns three watches\\nand sends Tarber, Kurz, and \\nCutjack\\n to keep watch from the towerhouse, telling Kurz to use his hunting horn if\\ndanger threatens. They drive their wagons and animals inside and bar the main gate. Dobber, Gendry, and Arya\\ndraw cook duty and Arya is set to pluck the goose and two chickens Koss brings in, while Gendry splits wood and\\nYoren sharpens his dirk. Everyone is quiet during the meal, even Lommy.\\nArya draws second watch, but when sleep proves difficult she borrows Yoren\\'s whetstone and hones \\nNeedle\\n instead.\\nHot Pie asks where she got such a good sword, more politely than \\nbefore\\n and she admits \\nher brother\\n gave it to her.\\nHot Pie is surprised, as Arya has never mentioned any brothers. Arya replies that she has lots of brothers, but when\\nHot Pie asks whether they are older or younger than her, she lies that they are all older, with longswords, and they\\ntaught her how to kill people who bother her. Hot Pie insists he was just talking, but then leaves her alone. Curling\\nup on her pallet, Arya is annoyed by the \\ncrying girl\\n, who is crying as usual.\\nArya dreams of a wolf howling and wakes at once. Pulling on her boots, she asks if anyone else heard anything.\\nLommy mocks her for having wolves in her head, and Woth and \\nGerren\\n assure her the wolves are safely outside.\\nArya insists there was a wolf, and before the others can shout her down they hear Kurz\\' hunting horn. In a heartbeat,\\neveryone is dressing and arming themselves, while Arya rushes to the gate. As she passes the barn, \\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\ncalls out for her to free the criminals so they can fight, but she ignores him.\\nClimbing the parapet, Arya glimpses hundreds of men with torches setting fire to the town. Gendry asks how many\\nthere are, but they are moving too fast to count. Soon a column of riders approaches the holdfast. Arya thinks their\\nbanner might be red, but the fires turn everything red, orange, or black. Reining up before the gates, a knight in a\\nspiked helm demands they open it in the name of the king. \\nReysen\\n sarcastically asks which king, earning him a cuff\\nfrom Woth.\\nWhen Yoren explains that the townsfolk are gone, the knight suggests Yoren might be one of \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n\\'s\\nmen and \\nThoros of Myr\\n could be hiding with them. Yoren insists he only has some lads for the Night\\'s Watch and\\nshows his black cloak as evidence, but the knight\\'s banner-bearer insists it could be \\nHouse Dondarrion\\n\\'s purple\\nlighting bolt on black. Arya now recognizes the Lannister banner and remembers that Beric Dondarrion was the man\\nher father\\n \\nsent out\\n to behead Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n.\\nThe knight demands they open the gate or be known as outlaws, but Yoren demands to know who is in command. A\\nstout man with a manticore on his shield rides forward to introduce himself as Ser \\nAmory Lorch\\n, bannerman to Lord\\nTywin Lannister\\n, and repeat the order to open the holdfast in the name of the \\ntrue\\n king, \\nJoffrey Baratheon\\n. Yoren\\nsays it does not matter to him if they burn the town, but his band are not their foes and should be left alone. Arya is\\nbewildered that the raiders cannot see they are neither lords nor knights, but Gendry opines that they simply do not\\ncare. Looking at Ser Amory\\'s face the way \\nSyrio Forel\\n taught her, Arya realizes Gendry is right.\\nSer Amory insists his men be allowed to verify Yoren\\'s story, but Yoren senses a trick and refuses again. Lorch\\'s\\nmen mock the old recruiter, and Lorch commands a final time to open the gate. Yoren considers for a long moment\\nbefore refusing again. Lorch declares them rebels, be they black brothers or not. Yoren informs Lorch that he has\\nsome young boys with him, but Lorch declares they will die just the same. He gives a languid signal and a spear\\nhurtles toward Yoren, but kills Woth instead. Lorch orders his men to storm the walls and kill everyone. More\\nspears fly, followed by torches.\\nYoren commands them to spread out and hold the walls. Arya finds herself next to Hot Pie, who panics and says he\\ndoes not know how to fight. Arya lies that it is easy and pushes aside a sudden terror to scream, \"Winterfell!\" and\\nhack at the first hand to appear on the parapet. Warned by Hot Pie, Arya forces the next climber back off the wall.\\nFollowing her example, Hot Pie hacks the hand of a third. Ser Amory and his men have no ladders, but the walls are\\nrough enough to climb, so there is no end to the foes, and each man they defeat is immediately replaced.\\nArya sees Yoren drive his dirk into the knight in the spiked helm, and watches Koss shoot down four axemen\\nattacking the gate. She sees the Lannister banner again and wishes Joffrey was present for her to stab. Dobber\\nwrestles a man of the walk and Lommy smashes his head, yet Lommy\\'s celebration is cut short when he sees\\nDobber\\'s body with the man\\'s knife in his belly. She hears \\nQyle\\n beg for mercy until a knight with a wasp sigil\\n\\nsmashes his face with a spiked mace.\\nThe smells of blood, smoke, iron, and piss blur together. Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie wrestle a skinny man to the\\nground. Gendry breaks his sword on the man\\'s helm, which falls off to reveal an old, frightened face. Arya feels\\nsorry for the man, even as she and Hot Pie are killing him. Gendry takes the man\\'s sword and leaps down into the\\nyard, looking for foes. Arya notices more enemies have invaded the holdfast and follows Gendry, but then she is\\nuncertain which way to go, since death is all around her.\\nSuddenly, Yoren is shaking her. He declares that the battle is lost, and orders her to gather as many survivors as she\\ncan and escape through the tunnel under the barn. Quick as that, he storms off again to rejoin the fighting. Arya\\ngrabs Gendry and explains the plan. They call Hot Pie down from the walk and find Lommy bleeding from a spear\\nwound in his calf. They find find Gerren too, but he is too seriously wounded. The crying girl will not walk, even\\nwhen slapped, so Arya has to drag her while the others race ahead.\\nThe barn is on fire when she arrives, and Hot Pie urges her to just leave the girl behind, but Arya stubbornly\\ncontinues to drag her. Hot Pie abandons them and scuttles back inside, but Gendry comes back to hoist the girl over\\nhis shoulder. The barn feels like a furnace. The back wall is ablaze and the animals are kicking and screaming.\\nInside their wagon, \\nBiter\\n and Rorge struggle frantically to get free while Jaqen H\\'ghar calls out to Arya in his\\nfriendly voice. The trap door is only a few feet ahead and the fire is spreading fast, which reminds Arya of \\nthe\\nHound\\n\\'s horrible burned face. Gendry wonders how to get the little girl through the narrow tunnel. Arya tells him to\\npush her and asks where he left the axe. Eying the prisoners, Gendry says it is by the haven but he would save the\\nanimals first. Arya tells him to go ahead with the girl and goes to get the axe.\\nOutside, she sees Koss killed on the spot after he yields. There is no sign of Yoren, but the axe is where Gendry left\\nit. As she wrenches it loose, a mailed hand grabs her arm. Spinning, she drives the axe up between the man\\'s legs,\\nthen dashes back to the barn. With heavy smoke pouring out and the animals screaming within, going back into the\\nbarn is the hardest thing she has ever done. Inside, the roof has caught fire as well, and flaming bits of wood and\\nstraw are raining down. The smoke is so thick she cannot see the wagon, so she crawls toward Biter\\'s screams.\\nFinding the wagon, she throws the axe in and runs for the tunnel. Rorge catches it and starts hacking at the wagon.\\nArya hears the wagon splinter just before she rolls headfirst into the tunnel. She drops five feet and gets dirt in her\\nmouth, but she does not care. She has crawled only a dozen feet when she hears the barn crash, sending a cloud of\\nhot smoke and black dust billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. She holds her breath and kisses the mud on the\\nfloor. Then she cries, but she does not know for whom.\\nNavigation:\\nArya III\\n↑\\nJon II\\n ←\\nArya IV\\n→ \\nTyrion III\\n↓\\nArya V\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 15: Tyrion III\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion II\\n↑\\nArya IV\\n ←\\nTyrion III\\n→ \\nBran II\\n↓\\nTyrion IV\\nThe \\nsmall council\\n discusses \\nStannis\\n\\'s declaration that \\nCersei\\n\\'s children are bastards born of incest. Cersei wants the\\nletters suppressed, but \\nTyrion\\n and \\nLittlefinger\\n convince her they should treat the letters with contempt whilst\\nspreading their own rumor that Stannis\\' \\ndaughter\\n is illegitimate. Tyrion leaves the council to meet with city\\'s smiths\\nto commission an immense chain, then meets with \\nVarys\\n via a secret passage in a \\nbrothel\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nCersei Lannister\\n is furious upon learning that \\nStannis Baratheon\\n is circulating letters accusing her of incest. The\\nsmall council\\n has two copies of the proclamation: one received by \\nMaester\\n \\nFrenken\\n at Castle \\nStokeworth\\n and a\\nsecond received by Lord \\nGyles Rosby\\n. \\nLittlefinger\\n notes that if Stannis sent letters to them, every other lord in the\\nSeven Kingdoms\\n has seen a copy. Cersei wants every copy burned so that neither \\nher father\\n nor \\nJoffrey\\n learns of\\nthem, but \\nTyrion Lannister\\n points out copies have likely been sent to \\nHarrenhal\\n and \\nCasterly Rock\\n as well and the\\nsecret is out. When Cersei rages that she is being accused of incest, adultery, and treason, Tyrion is impressed by her\\nacting skills since he knows the accusations are perfectly true. He points out that such claims are to be expected\\nsince Stannis needs a pretext to justify his rebellion. When Cersei insists she will not be called a whore, Tyrion only\\nthinks that Stannis never claimed \\nJaime\\n paid her.\\nGlancing back over the letter, Tyrion points out the strange words \"Done in the \\nLight of the Lord\\n.\" \\nGrand Maester\\nPycelle\\n explains it is a term commonly used in \\nFree Cities\\n, and Littlefinger notes that \\nVarys\\n, who is absent for\\nreasons known only to Tyrion, reported years ago that Stannis\\' wife \\nSelyse\\n took up with a \\nred priest\\n. Tyrion notes\\nthat this can be used as propaganda against Stannis.\\nCersei brings up the accusations again and urges an edict to suppress its dissemination. Tyrion points out that tearing\\nout a man\\'s tongue only proves you fear what he might say. When Cersei asks what he proposes, Tyrion suggests\\nthey just let people whisper until they grow bored; without proof many will see the letter as Stannis\\' pathetic attempt\\nto justify his rebellion. Littlefinger agrees, adding that they should fight fire with fire by spreading a similar rumor\\nthat \\nShireen Baratheon\\n is a bastard and Stannis a cuckold.\\nLittlefinger proposes Shireen\\'s fool \\nPatchface\\n should be called the father to make the story more shocking. Pycelle\\nexclaims that Lady Selyse would never bring a fool into her bed, but Littlefinger replies one would have to be a fool\\nto want to bed Selyse. He adds that the fool\\'s devotion to the girl, and their similarly mottled, half-frozen faces will\\nenforce the tale. Pycelle protests that Shireen was scarred by \\ngreyscale\\n, but Littlefinger notes the smallfolk are not\\nknown for their intelligence. Cersei smiles and calls Littlefinger wicked, and he thanks her. Tyrion recommends the\\nnews not come from them lest it be seen as the self-serving lie it is, and Littlefinger suggests using whores and pot-\\nshops.\\nTyrion takes his leave, and when Cersei asks why, he tells her he is having a gift made for Joffrey: a little chain.\\nCersei retorts that Joffrey has lots of chains and Tyrion cannot buy his love. Tyrion replies that one day Joffrey may\\ntreasure this chain above all others.\\nBronn\\n is waiting outside to inform Tyrion the smiths he summoned are waiting in his audience chamber. Tyrion\\ncompliments the sellsword that he almost sounds like a proper courtier and teases that he will be kneeling next.\\n\\nBronn responds with, \"Fuck you, dwarf.\" Tyrion counters with, \"That\\'s \\nShae\\n\\'s task.\" As Bronn escorts him back to\\nthe \\nTower of the Hand\\n, Lady \\nTanda Stokeworth\\n hails Tyrion, but he ignores her and gives orders for his litter to be\\nprepared. In his chambers, he finds his timid squire \\nPodrick Payne\\n laying out his clothing and the \\nHand\\n\\'s chain of\\noffice.\\nEntering his audience chamber, Tyrion cuts straight to the point by presenting the assembled smiths with three links\\nof an immense chain and commanding them to make a thousand more. He orders every forge and every metalworker\\nin the city put to work making and joining more links, and puts Goodman \\nIronbelly\\n in charge of seeing it done. The\\nsmiths immediately ask about the queen\\'s orders for armor and weapons, and her threat of crushed hands for missed\\nquotas. Tyrion assures them no hands will be crushed, thinking of the love Cersei is creating for them among the\\nsmallfolk. Ironbelly asks about supplies of iron and coke, and Tyrion promises Lord Baelish will see they have\\nenough coin while the \\nCity Watch\\n will help them find and melt down every horseshoe in the city for iron if required.\\nThen an older smith, \\nSalloreon\\n, complains that such work is only fit for common smiths, not master armorers like\\nhimself. He offers to make Tyrion a terrifying suit of plate instead, but Tyrion replies that he can either make chains\\nor wear them, and then departs.\\nOutside, Bronn waits with a litter and an escort of \\nBlack Ears\\n. As he travels, Tyrion muses that he has set hundreds\\nof carpenters to building fishing boats instead of catapults, opened the \\nkingswood\\n to hunters, and even sent gold\\ncloaks foraging to deal with hunger in the city, but people still give him accusing looks. He also reflects that Cersei\\nmissed the importance of Stannis declaring himself king, and wonders what \\nRenly Baratheon\\n will make of it.\\nPeering out into the streets he wonders who the informers in the crowd are, and decides they are likely the most\\ninnocent-looking ones.\\nHis destination is a two-story \\nbrothel\\n behind \\nRhaenys\\'s Hill\\n. Inside, he is greeted by a tall, black-skinned woman\\nwho names herself \\nChataya\\n. When Tyrion asks to see the girls, Chataya recommends a dark-skinned girl of 16 who\\nturns out to be her daughter \\nAlayaya\\n; in the \\nSummer Isles\\n being a whore is considered an honor and pleasing to the\\ngods. Tyrion wonders what the gods have to do with it, and jests that he would be much more religious if he could\\npray with his cock.\\nLeading Tyrion upstairs to the turret room, Alayaya directs him into a wardrobe, where he finds a secret panel and\\nbeyond that a hidden shaft leading down to an underground tunnel where Varys waits in disguise. Tyrion asks if\\nChataya can be trusted, and Varys explains she has no love for the queen and is grateful to be rid of \\nAllar Deem\\n.\\nWhen Tyrion asks how the brothel came to have a secret entrance, Varys explains that the tunnel was dug for\\nanother Hand who would not enter the house openly.\\nEmerging into a stable, Varys helps disguise Tyrion as child and saddle a horse. Tyrion tells him that Stannis has\\naccused Jaime and Cersei of incest, and asks how he came by that suspicion. Varys responds that perhaps someone\\nwhispered it to him, or else he simply looked at color of a bastard\\'s hair as \\nJon Arryn\\n and \\nEddard Stark\\n did; after all,\\neach of the eight bastards of King \\nRobert\\n that Varys knows had black hair regardless of their mother\\'s color. Tyrion\\nwonders if the whisper might have come from Littlefinger, but Varys refuses to confirm. After Varys helps him\\nmount, Tyrion declares to Varys that he is either his best friend or his worst enemy. Varys replies that he feels quite\\nthe same about Tyrion.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion II\\n↑\\nArya IV\\n ←\\nTyrion III\\n→ \\nBran II\\n↓\\nTyrion IV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 16: Bran II\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran I\\n↑\\nTyrion III\\n ←\\nBran II\\n→ \\nTyrion IV\\n↓\\nBran III\\nBran\\n receives the lords of \\nthe North\\n at \\nWinterfell\\n for the \\nharvest feast\\n. Each has business to discuss, and many are\\ninterested in wedding Lady \\nDonella Hornwood\\n, whose \\nhusband\\n and \\nonly son\\n have died in the south. Lady\\nHornwood herself is concerned that \\nRamsay Snow\\n, the bastard of \\nthe Dreadfort\\n, means to seize her lands. The night\\nCley Cerwyn\\n arrives with news that \\nStannis\\n has declared \\nJoffrey\\n a bastard, Bran dreams of a \\ngolden man\\n throwing\\nhim from a tower.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n is awake long before dawn. \\nWinterfell\\n is full of guests for the \\nharvest feast\\n, and he must play the prince. He\\nalways wanted to be a \\nknight\\n, not a prince, but now that he is broken he must spend his days listening to old men\\ndiscuss things he barely understands. Lord \\nWyman Manderly\\n arrived from \\nWhite Harbor\\n two day ago, and Bran\\nwelcomed him from \\nhis father\\n\\'s high seat. Afterward, Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n said he had done well, but Manderly was\\nonly the first. Many lords with matters to discuss with their overlord will use the feast as a pretext.\\nHodor\\n arrives to help him dress. Bran prefers to dress himself, but some things are just quicker with help. Bran is\\nastonished by Hodor\\'s deftness and strength and says he could have been a great knight if the gods had left him his\\nwits. Mounting into his basket, Bran instructs Hodor to carry him downstairs.\\nOut in the yard, Bran watches the Walders jousting against quintains. Bran notes that \\nLittle Walder\\n struck harder,\\nbut \\nBig Walder\\n sat his horse better. When Little Walder sees Bran on Hodor\\'s back, he remarks that Hodor is an\\nugly horse, which angers Bran. The Walders continue to insult Hodor and Little Walder begins bumping him with\\nhis horse. Bran grows angrier and threatens to sic \\nSummer\\n on them, but Little Walder points out he is wearing armor\\nand says he wants a wolfskin cloak. Then, \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n arrives to break up the argument and chastise the\\nWalders. Big Walder has the grace to look ashamed, but Little Walder remains haughty. Luwin reminds them that\\ngood lords protect the weak and warns them to stay out of the \\ngodswood\\n. He then calls on Bran to come with him to\\nmeet Lord Wyman.\\nThe maester tells Bran he was right to defend Hodor, but it should not have been necessary to fetch him to meet\\nLord Wyman. Bran apologizes and asks if they will talk of the \\nwar\\n. Luwin reminds Bran that he is only eight and\\nshould not speak unless spoken to. Inside, Bran is seated in his father\\'s chair with Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik\\nbeside him. The morbidly obese Lord Wyman Manderly is very pleasant, insisting no prince is ever late. He talks\\nabout White Harbor being the best place to mint currency and build a fleet for Robb\\'s new kingdom. Talk of\\nwarships piques Bran\\'s interest and he thinks it a splendid idea, but no one asks him. The meeting continues through\\nlunch, during which Lord Wyman inquires about his widowed cousin Lady \\nDonella Hornwood\\n, whose \\nhusband\\n and\\nonly son\\n died on the \\nGreen Fork\\n and in the \\nWhispering Wood\\n. He suggests that he would be interested in marrying\\nher, or she could wed his son Ser \\nWendel\\n. Later, Lord Wyman informs them that \\nTywin Lannister\\n has offered to\\nransom his son Ser \\nWylis\\n (who was taken captive on the Green Fork) if he withdraws his support for King \\nRobb\\n. He\\nhas of course refused, but hopes for an equitable prisoner exchange as soon as possible.\\nLady Hornwood arrives during supper, and Bran expresses his condolences to the grief-stricken widow. She thanks\\nthem, but asks leave to rest and continue the next day. The next morning\\'s talk is devoted to preparations for the\\ncoming winter until Lady Hornwood warns them that \\nRoose Bolton\\n\\'s bastard son \\nRamsay Snow\\n is massing men at\\n\\nthe Dreadfort\\n and refuses to explain his purpose. When Ser Rodrik says he does not know the man, Lady Hornwood\\nexplains that Ramsay lived with his mother until \\nDomeric Bolton\\n died and left Roose without an heir. She adds that\\nRamsay brought along an equally-cruel servant named \\nReek\\n who is said to never bathe. The two hunt together, and\\nnot for deer, and there are other tales that are hard to believe even of a Bolton.\\nLady Hornwood fears Ramsay covets her lands now that her husband and son are gone. Bran wants to give her a\\nhundred men, but Ser Rodrik only promises to protect her lands and adds that in time it may be prudent for her to\\nwed again. She remarks that she is beyond childbearing age yet attracts more suitors than ever. She promises to\\nmarry if commanded, but there is no one to her liking. She points out that Lord Manderly is too big to share a bed\\nwith or lie underneath; Bran knows that men sleep on top of their wives, and imagines sleeping under Lord Wyman\\nwould be like sleeping under a horse. Ser Rodrik sympathizes and promises to look for a suitor more to Lady\\nHornwood\\'s taste, at which point she hints interest in Ser Rodrik himself.\\nAfter she leaves, Maester Luwin points out Lady Hornwood\\'s hint, which makes Ser Rodrik uncomfortable. Bran\\nnotes that she is sad; Ser Rodrik adds that she is also gentle and not unattractive, but still a threat to the realm. Bran\\nis incredulous, but the maester explains that without a direct heir there will be many claims to her lands, which Robb\\nmust adjudicate as the liege lord. When Bran suggests Ser Rodrik, the old castellan replies that he is only a knight\\nand too old; when he dies the problem would resurface. Thinking of his own half-brother, Bran next suggests Lord\\nHornwood\\'s twelve-year-old bastard \\nLarence Snow\\n. Ser Rodrik doubts that will please Lady Hornwood, but Maester\\nLuwin insists they consider it.\\nBran asks to be excused and Ser Rodrik agrees, saying he did well. There are still a few hours of daylight, so Bran\\ngoes to the godswood to visit Summer. He has Hodor take him to his favorite place by the pool near the \\nheart tree\\n.\\nSuddenly, a naked \\nOsha\\n explodes out of the cold pool, startling everyone. When Bran asks about the cold, Osha says\\nshe likes it. She notices Bran staring at her and asks if he has never seen a naked woman. Bran has bathed with his\\nsisters and seen serving women bathing, but Osha is hard and covered in scars, which she tells him were earned\\nfighting men, mostly \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n; she even killed one. Then she mentions overhearing that the Walders mocked\\nHodor. Bran recalls that Hodor never fights and says that \\nSepton\\n \\nChayle\\n says Hodor has a gentle spirit. Osha replies\\nthat Little Walder is well named: big outside, little inside, and mean to the bones. Then she asks if Bran has had any\\nmore wolf dreams. When he say no, Osha declares a prince should lie better and begs his leave before hurrying back\\nto the kitchens.\\nThat night, Bran dreams of a \\nweirwood\\n calling to him and a \\nthree-eyed crow\\n pecking at his face. He wakes to\\nclamor of the arrival of the \\nUmbers\\n from beyond the \\nLast River\\n. The next day, he greets their leaders, two of\\nGreatjon Umber\\n\\'s uncles: \\nMors Umber\\n (known as \"Crowfood\" because he lost an eye to a crow that thought him\\ndead), and \\nHother Umber\\n (known as \"Whoresbane\" for reasons no one will tell Bran). Mors immediately asks to\\nwed Lady Hornwood; Luwin and Rodrik explain she is grieving but promise to consider it. Hother asks for\\nlongships to stop \\nwildling\\n raids across the \\nBay of Seals\\n; Ser Rodrik recommends Hothor cooperate with Lord\\nManderly to provide lumber and receive shipwrights and sailors.\\nDuring the audience, the steward of \\nDeepwood Motte\\n arrives with apologies from Lady \\nSybelle Glover\\n, who is\\ntending to her young children. Bran quickly realizes the steward is the true ruler while Lord \\nGalbart Glover\\n and his\\nbrother \\nRobett Glover\\n are away fighting. After discussing the harvest, Ser Rodrik questions the steward about\\nLarence Snow, and afterward Maester Luwin praises Bran\\'s notion of making the bastard heir to Hornwood and says\\nhe will make a good lord for Winterfell one day. Bran protests that Robb\\'s sons with his \\nFrey\\n girl will be lords\\ninstead of him, but Ser Rodrik points out that nothing is certain; he has only his daughter \\nBeth\\n despite three\\nmarriages, and his brother \\nMartyn Cassel\\n\\'s line died with his son \\nJory\\n despite having four sons.\\nThe next day, \\nLeobald Tallhart\\n from \\nTorrhen\\'s Square\\n, who arrived the day before, has his audience. He brings word\\nthat his nephew \\nBenfred Tallhart\\n is raising his own company of young lancers who all think themselves another\\nyoung wolf; Leobald dismissed them as young rabbits once, so now they call themselves the \\nWild Hares\\n. Bran\\nremembers Benfred visiting Winterfell and being friendly with Robb and \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n. Clearly displeased, Ser\\nRodrik orders that Benfred is to remain at Torrhen\\'s Square as commanded. Then Leobald mentions that his own\\nwife \\nBerena\\n was sister to Lord Halys Hornwood and suggests sending his younger son \\nBeren\\n to foster with Lady\\nHornwood, saying he may even take up the Hornwood name if made heir. Bran has learned the proper answer and\\npromises to bring up the matter with Robb and Lady Hornwood. After the audience, Maester Luwin states that he\\nlikes the idea, but Ser Rodrik thinks it will be hard for a boy to hold the lands. Luwin admits that with \\nthe Riverlands\\n\\nnow part of the kingdom, it may be best to wed her to one of the lords of the \\nTrident\\n.\\nIn the days that follow, ravens arrive with regrets from the other Houses. The bastard Ramsay Snow will not be\\njoining them, the \\nMormonts\\n and \\nKarstarks\\n have all gone south, Lord \\nOndrew Locke\\n is too old, Lady \\nLyessa Flint\\n is\\ntoo pregnant, and there is sickness at \\nWidow\\'s Watch\\n. That leaves just Lord \\nHowland Reed\\n, who has not left his\\nswamps in sixteen years, and the \\nHouse Cerwyn\\n, whose Lord \\nMedger Cerwyn\\n is a captive of the Lannisters.\\nThen, one blustery day, fourteen-year-old \\nCley Cerwyn\\n arrives with a dozen lancers while Bran is riding \\nDancer\\n in\\nthe yard. Cley has always been a friend to Bran and his brothers and he immediately asks if \\nStannis Baratheon\\n wrote\\nWinterfell about \\nJoffrey Baratheon\\n being illborn. Bran suddenly feels like a giant hand is crushing his chest. When\\nCley asks if he is alright, Bran declares that Robb will beat Stannis, too. That night he does not have the dreamless\\nsleep he prayed for. The three-eyed crow pecks out his eyes, telling him to fly. Then the crow pecks his brow until it\\npecks through his skull and then, suddenly, Bran can see again. He is climbing to a tower, slipping. He calls for help\\nand a \\ngolden man\\n appears above him, saying, \"The things I do for love,\" and then tossing him out into empty air.\\nNavigation:\\nBran I\\n↑\\nTyrion III\\n ←\\nBran II\\n→ \\nTyrion IV\\n↓\\nBran III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 17: Tyrion IV\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n - \\nRed Keep\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion III\\n↑\\nBran II\\n ←\\nTyrion IV\\n→ \\nSansa II\\n↓\\nTyrion V\\nTyrion\\n meets with \\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n, \\nLittlefinger\\n, and \\nVarys\\n in turn, and gives each a secret plan.

He insists Pycelle send his swiftest birds immediately; breakfast will\\nkeep, but the realm may not with Lord \\nRenly Baratheon\\n leading his host up the \\nroseroad\\n, and no one knowing when\\nLord \\nStannis Baratheon\\n will sail from \\nDragonstone\\n. Pycelle moves ponderously to obey, and Tyrion notes that his\\nmaester\\n\\'s chain is far more ornate than the standard.\\nTyrion has plenty of time to finish part of his breakfast before he sees the ravens take off. He then inspects Pycelle\\'s\\nwell-organized potions and steals a small bottle from the high shelf. He is back eating when the maester returns to\\ninquire about the message, but Tyrion insists it is best kept a secret. When Pycelle suggests bringing the matter to\\nthe \\nsmall council\\n, Tyrion replies that the council exists to advise King \\nJoffrey\\n, who is only thirteen. When ascked\\nabout the queen, Tyrion replies that \\nCersei\\n carries a great weight already and Pycelle reluctantly agrees it is best not\\nto add to her burden, given the frailty of her sex. Tyrion wonders what \\nEddard Stark\\n would think of that description,\\nbut says nothing and asks to be informed secretly when a reply comes from \\nDorne\\n. As he departs, Tyrion thinks to\\nhimself, \\nOne\\n.\\nIn the lower bailey, Tyrion finds \\nBronn\\n (who is now armored as befits his role as captain of the \\nHand\\n\\'s guard)\\nwatching the men-at-arms practice. He jokingly notes that Bronn is paying no attention to a pair of pretty serving\\ngirls. Bronn replies that he can buy all the sex he wants, but one day his vigilance could save his life. He points out\\nthat the \\nhedge knight\\n named Ser \\nTallad\\n is the best, but he falls into a rhythm that will be his death when he faces\\nBronn.\\nAs they cross the bailey, Bronn informs Tyrion that thirty supplicants await him, including Lady \\nTanda Stokeworth\\n\\'s\\npage with an invitation to supper. Lady Tanda thinks Tyrion would be the prefect consort for her soft, dimwitted\\ndaughter \\nLollys\\n and is plying him with food; Tyrion tells Bronn to send his regrets. There is also a moneylender\\nfrom \\nBraavos\\n wanting repayment of a loan; Tyrion orders him directed to \\nLittlefinger\\n, who will find a way to put\\nhim off. Another supplicant is a minor lordling from the \\nTrident\\n who wants recompense for the destruction done to\\nhis land. Seeing the value of a compliant \\nriver lord\\n, Tyrion promises to make time for him tomorrow and orders him\\ngiven good quarters, a meal, and new boots courtesy of King Joffrey. There are also many food merchants who want\\nprotection from the hungry mobs who recently roasted a baker in his own oven for overcharging. Tyrion suggests\\ngold cloaks\\n, but Bronn notes there were gold cloaks in the mob, and the merchants demand to see the king. Tyrion\\ncalls them fools since Joffrey would send them off with whips and spears. Bronn also reports that Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\nof the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n has arrived with a rotten hand. Tyrion recalls his distaste for the man, and orders him given a\\ndirty cell and left waiting.\\nAfter Bronn departs to carry out his orders, Tyrion encounters Cersei and her retinue by the main gate. When he\\n\\nasks where she is going, Cersei claims she is going to inspect the defenses in light of Renly marching from\\nHighgarden\\n. She believes he could arrive by the full moon, but Tyrion assures her that Renly is traveling too slowly\\nand stopping to feast and hold court at a different castle each night. Tyrion is dubious that Renly actually has the\\nrumored 100,000 men, but Cersei snaps that he has all the power of \\nStorm\\'s End\\n and Highgarden; only \\nHouse\\nRedwyne\\n has held back, and that is thanks to her taking the twins \\nHoras\\n and \\nHobber\\n captive. Tyrion retorts that it is\\na shame she let Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n slip away, and points out Renly has \\nRobb Stark\\n at \\nRiverrun\\n and \\nTywin Lannister\\n at\\nHarrenhal\\n to concern him. He adds that he would do the same as Renly: progress slowly, flaunt his power, watch,\\nand wait. If Robb defeats Tywin, the south will fall into Renly\\'s hands like a windfall, and if Tywin defeats Robb,\\nRenly can attack the weakened Lannister host. Cersei demands Tyrion make their father bring his army to King\\'s\\nLanding, but Tyrion points out he has never been able to make Lord Tywin do anything. Ignoring this answer, she\\nasks what he is doing to free \\nJaime\\n, who is worth a hundred of Tyrion. Tyrion quips that they do not have a hundred\\nof him to trade to \\nCatelyn Stark\\n. Angered, Cersei declares him worse than useless and leaves.\\nIn truth, Tyrion fears Stannis twice as much as Renly; Renly is beloved but inexperienced in war, while Stannis is\\ncold, hard, and inexorable. The spies sent to Dragonstone are ominously silent, though \\nLysene\\n war galleys have\\nbeen spotted and \\nVarys\\n reports \\nsellsail\\n captains taking service with Dragonstone. If Stannis and Renly attack\\ntogether by sea and land there will be no chance for Joffrey, or himself.\\nPodrick Payne\\n meets him at the door of his solar and shyly informs him that Petyr Baelish is inside. He finds\\nLittlefinger seated by the window, watching Joffrey kill hares with his new crossbow in the yard below. Observing\\nJoffrey\\'s poor aim, Littlefinger quips that the hares are winning and advises Pod to invest in pots since the castle will\\nsoon be overrun with hares and they will be eating potted hare for every meal. Tyrion dismisses Pod and offers\\nLittlefinger refreshment. Littlefinger politely declines, noting that he has heard to drink with Tyrion is to risk being\\nsent to the Wall.\\nTyrion compliments Littlefinger on his clothing and notes his \\nValyrian steel\\n dagger with the \\ndragonbone\\n hilt. There\\nis mischief in Littlefinger\\'s eyes when he responds that is a trifle plain and offers it to Tyrion as a gift. Tyrion\\nrefuses, infuriated that Littlefinger knows why he mentioned the dagger and is mocking him because he thinks\\nTyrion cannot touch him. Tyrion reflects that his brother Jaime is famous for his gilded steel armor, but if ever a\\nman truly armored himself in gold it is Littlefinger. Ten years ago, \\nJon Arryn\\n gave him a minor position in customs,\\nwhere he soon tripled the revenue. Within three years he was master of coin, and now the crown\\'s revenues are ten\\ntimes what they were. The crown\\'s debts have grown vast, too, but Littlefinger is a master juggler and borrows so he\\ncan put the gold to work. He invests in wagons, shops, ships, houses, agribusiness, textiles, and moneylending, and\\nthe \\ngold dragons\\n breed and multiply. At the same time, Littlefinger moved his own men into place:, the \\nKing\\'s\\nCounter\\n, the \\nKing\\'s Scales\\n, all four \\nKeepers of the Keys\\n, and the officers managing the three mints are his, as well\\nnine of every ten among as the harbormasters, tax farmers, customs agents, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, and\\nwine factors. All of them are mostly men of middling birth, lesser lordlings, or even foreigners, but far more capable\\nthan the highborns they replaced. No one questioned the appointments because Littlefinger is perceived as harmless\\nwithout soldiers, holdings, or marriage prospects, yet Tyrion is unsure if he can touch him.\\nTyrion asks how close Littlefinger was with the \\nTully\\n children during his fostering at Riverrun. Littlefinger boasts\\nthat he took both girl\\'s maidenheads, which Tyrion considers a very smooth lie. Tyrion explains that Catelyn and\\nLysa\\n would refuse any offer he might make, but they might trust Littlefinger. He adds that he hopes to sway the\\nmore tractable Lysa by offering her Jon Arryn\\'s true killer. Intrigued, Littlefinger asks who, but Tyrion only says\\nthat Lysa would have to understand he only gives gifts to his friends, meaning she must first ally with the\\nLannisters. Littlefinger points out that Lysa has her own woes, such as the \\nVale mountain clans\\n, who are now more\\naggressive and better armed thanks to Tyrion. Tyrion promises to use his influence to call off the clansmen if Lysa\\ndeclares for Joffrey. Littlefinger insists Lysa will never make war on the Starks or Tullys, but Tyrion assures him\\nLysa\\'s power would only be used to oppose Renly or Stannis. In return, Tyrion will give her justice, peace, name her\\nson \\nWarden of the East\\n, and wed his niece Princess \\nMyrcella\\n to little Lord \\nRobert Arryn\\n.\\nLittlefinger asks what Cersei thinks of the ploy, and laughs when Tyrion only shrugs. Then, Littlefinger asks what\\nhis reward will be, and Tyrion promises him Harrenhal and supremacy over the \\nriverlands\\n as their \\nliege lord\\n.\\nLittlefinger\\'s reaction amuses Tyrion; by birth he holds only a few stoney acres on the \\nFingers\\n, but Harrenhal is one\\nof the realm\\'s richest domains. Littlefinger is suspicious, especially considering that \\nJanos Slynt\\n also received\\nHarrenhal for his good service, but Tyrion assures him that he is more valuable than Slynt. Appeased, Littlefinger\\nnotes that he will likely have to bed Lysa again to get her consent and asks for a fortnight to prepare. As Littlefinger\\n\\ndeparts, Tyrion thinks to himself, \\nTwo\\n.\\nNext, Tyrion heads to his bedchamber to await Varys. An hour later, \\nGalt\\n announces the eunuch\\'s arrival, much\\nsooner than Tyrion expected. Varys quips that Tyrion was cruel to taunt Pycelle with a secret, but Tyrion accuses\\nVarys of the same thing and offers to tell him. Varys suggests his little birds may have already told him: Tyrion\\nhopes to dissuade \\nDorne\\n from joining another faction, even though Prince Doran\\'s hatred for House Lannister is well\\nknown. Tyrion points out that much is obvious.\\nVarys notes that Prince Doran is a sentimental man who still mourns his murdered sister \\nElia\\n. Tyrion reveals he has\\noffered Doran a council seat and his sister\\'s killer. Varys points out that Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n (who is known to have\\nmurdered Elia) is a Lannister bannerman, but Tyrion argues that Lord Tywin will agree 50,000 Dornishmen are\\nworth one rabid dog. When Varys wonders aloud what might happen if Doran demands the blood of the lord who\\ngave the command as well, Tyrion blames Robert Baratheon since it was his rebellion. Varys points out Robert was\\nnot at King\\'s Landing, but Tyrion replies that neither was Doran Martell.\\nVarys notes that Doran will want a token of good faith as well, and asks who Tyrion will offer. Tyrion turns the\\nquestion back on Varys, who declares it must be \\nTommen\\n since Tyrion cannot offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and\\nLysa Arryn both. Varys\\' uncanny knowledge leads Tyrion to quip that he cheats at guessing games. Varys calls\\nTommen a good boy, and Tyrion comments that he might even grow into a good man if they get him away from\\nCersei and Joffrey soon enough. Varys acts suspicious that Tyrion might mean to make Tommen king, but Tyrion\\ninsists Joffrey is king. Varys points out there is a flaw in the scheme named Cersei, who will never consent to part\\nwith both Tommen \\nand\\n Myrcella. Tyrion says what Cersei does not know will not hurt him. When Varys asks what\\nwill happen if she does learn of it, Tyrion declares that he would know the man who told her to be his certain enemy.\\nWhen Varys giggles at that, Tyrion thinks to himself, \\nThree\\n.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion III\\n↑\\nBran II\\n ←\\nTyrion IV\\n→ \\nSansa II\\n↓\\nTyrion V\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 18: Sansa II\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n - \\nRed Keep\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa I\\n↑\\nTyrion IV\\n ←\\nSansa II\\n→ \\nArya V\\n↓\\nSansa III\\nIn response to a secret note, \\nSansa\\n takes advantage of a ruckus outside the \\nRed Keep\\n to sneak to the \\ngodswood\\n,\\nwhere she is disappointed to find \\nDontos Hollard\\n instead of the dashing knight she prayed for. Nevertheless, Dontos\\nsays he has a plan to help her escape and take her home. On her way back, Sansa runs into a drunken \\nSandor\\nClegane\\n, who escorts her back to her chambers.\\nSynopsis\\nSansa\\n has found an anonymous note under her pillow telling her to come to the \\ngodswood\\n tonight if she wants to go\\nhome. She continues reading it over and over, wondering what it could mean. She has prayed so hard for a true\\nknight to save her, but perhaps it is only one of \\nJoffrey\\n\\'s cruel jokes or a clever snare to prove her disloyalty. She\\nfears she will only find Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n waiting for her with \\nIce\\n.\\nWhen her bedmaid enters unannounced to ask if she wants a bath, Sansa hurriedly hides the note. Worried the girl\\nsaw it, Sansa asks for a fire. Once the fire is lit, she orders the girl out and decides there was something sly in her\\neyes. Her servants are changed every fortnight to prevent her from befriending one, and Sansa is sure they all spy on\\nher. Once alone, she burns the note.\\nFrom her window, Sansa sees Ser \\nPreston Greenfield\\n pacing the drawbridge of \\nMaegor\\'s Holdfast\\n. She is free to\\nroam the whole \\nRed Keep\\n, but Ser Preston will still ask where she is going at this time of night. Unable to think of a\\nlie, Sansa crawls into bed instead, but her thoughts keep her awake. She wishes there was someone to tell her what\\nto do. She misses \\nSepta\\n \\nMordane\\n and her best friend \\nJeyne Poole\\n, and even her sister \\nArya\\n, who she is sure is back\\nin \\nWinterfell\\n by now.\\nHearing shouting, Sansa looks out to see armed men running to the wall and Ser Preston gone from the drawbridge.\\nWondering what she is doing, Sansa dresses quickly and hides her meat knife under her cloak. After darting across\\nthe undefended drawbridge, she passes men arming in the yard and sees three \\nKingsguard\\n helping Joffrey into his\\narmor. Fortunately, Joffrey is busy calling for his weapons and does not see her.\\nThe sounds fade as Sansa rushes towards the godswood, never daring to look back for fear of Joffrey. The godswood\\nis quiet and there is a wild feel to it even in the heart of the city, and Sansa can feel the \\nold gods\\n watching her. She\\nprefers \\nher mother\\n\\'s \\ngods\\n--with their artwork, incense, rainbows, and rich fabrics and gems--but the godswood has a\\ncertain power too, especially by night.\\nFearing she is too late, Sansa is surprised by the voice of \\nDontos Hollard\\n saying he feared she would not come.\\nWhen he reaches for her, Sansa shrinks back and reaches for her knife. Dontos insists he only wants to help her as\\nshe helped him. Sansa asks if he is drunk and Dontos admits he had a cup of wine to help his courage. Drawing her\\nknife, Sansa asks who sent him. Dontos swears on his knight\\'s honor that he came on his own, but Sansa recalls\\nJoffrey\\'s decree and says she prayed for a knight to save her, not a drunken old fool. Dontos accepts the rebuke, but\\nsays he hopes to find it in himself to be a knight again because of her, adding that Sansa not only saved him from\\nJoffrey, but also from himself.\\nDontos reminds her that \\nFlorian\\n was both a fool and the greatest knight of all. He falls to his knees and asks to be\\n\\nher Florian. Still unsure, Sansa asks how he plans for her to escape. Dontos explains that the hardest part will be\\ngetting her out of the castle. Then a ship could take her home, but he needs to find coin and make arrangements\\nwithout raising suspicions, which will take time since he is also watched. When Sansa puts away her knife, Dontos\\nrises and laments that he did nothing to save \\nher father\\n. He then declares that he is not a hero like \\nRyam Redwyne\\n or\\nBarristan Selmy\\n and has won no glory in war or tourney, but Sansa has reminded him what it is to be a knight. He\\npledges himself to her and vows to the old gods that he will send her home.\\nAssured by his solemn oath, Sansa agrees to put herself in his hands. Then she asks if he will send another letter to\\nlet her know when, but he says that would be too dangerous. Instead, he instructs her to come to the godswood as\\noften as possible since nowhere else is safe. She agrees, and promises to be brave, strong, and patient above all.\\nDontos urges her to leave, and Sansa kisses him softly on the cheek and calls him, \"My Florian,\" certain that the\\ngods have heard her prayer.\\nOn her way back, giddily thinking about home and the songs about Florian and \\nJonquil\\n, Sansa caroms into \\nSandor\\nClegane\\n. The Hound catches her before she can fall and asks if she wants to kill them both on the serpentine steps.\\nWhen he asks what she is doing out so late, Sansa stutters that she was praying for her father and the king. The\\nHound replies that he is not drunk enough to believe that story, adding that although she is nearly a woman, Sansa is\\nstill just a little bird singing the songs they taught her. He mockingly asks her to sing him a song about knights and\\nfair maids, and asks if she likes knights. Sansa answers \\ntrue\\n knights, but the Hound mocks her and reminds her he is\\nnot a knight at all. Reeling and almost falling, the Hound curses that he had too much wine, then offers to take Sansa\\nback to her chambers. He pushes her gently and follows her down the steps.\\nUpon their return, they find Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n guarding the drawbridge. Sansa flinches away, but the Hound insists\\nBlount is not to be feared. When Ser Boros asks why she is not in her chambers, Sansa\\'s lie about the godswood\\nsounds more convincing than before. The Hound adds that she could not be expected to sleep with all the noise. Ser\\nBoros explains that preparations for \\nTyrek Lannister\\n\\'s wedding feast have convinced some wretches that they should\\nfeast, too. He adds that Joffrey led a sortie that sent the fools scurrying. Clegane states, \"A brave boy,\" but Sansa\\nwonders how brave Joffrey will be when he faces her brother \\nRobb\\n.\\nAfter crossing the drawbridge, Sansa asks why the Hound lets people call him a dog but never a knight. He replies\\nthat he likes dogs better, and explains that his grandfather was a kennelmaster at \\nCasterly Rock\\n who received lands\\nand a \\ntowerhouse\\n for saving Lord \\nTytos Lannister\\n from a \\nlion\\n, losing a leg and three dogs in the process. He adds\\nthat a dog will die for you and never lie to you, which is more than little birds can do. When he adds that he never\\ngot his song, Sansa suggests a song about Florian and Jonquil. The Hound dismisses it as a song about a fool and his\\ncunt, but insists he will have a song from her one day, whether she wants to or not. Sansa replies she will sing for\\nhim gladly, but Clegane retorts,\\nPretty thing, and such a bad liar. A dog can smell a lie, you know. Look around you, and take a good whiff.\\nThey’re all liars here... and every one better than you.”\\nNavigation:\\nSansa I\\n↑\\nTyrion IV\\n ←\\nSansa II\\n→ \\nArya V\\n↓\\nSansa III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 19: Arya V\\nPlace(s): \\nVillage west of the \\nGods Eye\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya IV\\n↑\\nSansa II\\n ←\\nArya V\\n→ \\nTyrion V\\n↓\\nArya VI\\nOn their way to scout a village, \\nGendry\\n unmasks \\nArya\\n as a girl, forcing her to reveal her true identity. The village\\nturns out to be occupied by Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n and his \\nmen\\n, and Gendry is captured. During a rescue attempt, \\nHot\\nPie\\n panics, leading to Arya\\'s capture as well. Later, \\na spearman\\n kills \\nLommy\\n rather than carry him.\\nSynopsis\\nFrom high in a tree, Arya can see a fishing village with some smoking chimneys. It is the first sign of life since they\\nfled the \\nholdfast\\n; the \\nLannisters\\n have burned or killed everything. The houses promise warmth and shelter, unless it\\nis Ser \\nAmory Lorch\\n there. Arya watches for a long time, trying to be sure, but it is too far to see for certain.\\nArya and the others waited until the next night to return to the burnt village. \\nHot Pie\\n and \\nLommy\\n were still afraid,\\nbut Lorch and his men were long gone. The holdfast was strewn with corpses from both sides, and scavengers had\\nbeen at them. One look was enough for \\nGendry\\n, but Arya insisted they find \\nYoren\\n, telling herself he could not be\\ndead. They found his body next to four Lannister men-at-arms, and Arya wondered how many men it took to bring\\nthe black brother down. There were too many bodies to bury everyone, but Arya insisted Yoren must have a grave,\\nand as they dug part of her wanted to cry and part of her wanted to kick Yoren.\\nThe only other survivors were \\nCutjack\\n, \\nKurz\\n, and \\nTarber\\n, who had been on look-out in the towerhouse. They came\\nunder attack as well, but the stone tower was inflammable and inaccessible with the ladder pulled up, so Lorch\\'s men\\nleft them. When Kurz decided they would do better continuing north, Arya clung to the hope of still reaching\\nWinterfell\\n, but Kurz took an arrow in the shoulder pulling up the towerhouse ladder and, despite Tarber treating it\\nwith mud and moss, the wound festered and killed him. Soon after, Tarber and Cutjack had taken the dead poacher\\'s\\nweapons and hunting horn when they abandoned them. Afterward, wanting no part of any roads, Arya and the others\\nmade their way up the muddy shore of \\nGod\\'s Eye\\n, taking turns carrying Lommy on a makeshift litter, since the spear\\nwound in his calf is now so bad he cannot walk.\\nFrom her tree, Arya sees that the air over the village is full of crows, but thirty yards from shore three black swans\\nglide serenely over the water, oblivious to the war. Part of Arya wants to be one of them, but the other part wants to\\neat one. She and the others have been living mostly on an awful-tasting acorn paste Kurz taught them to make,\\nthough Arya and \\nWeasel\\n (their new name for the crying girl) have also been eating bugs and worms. Arya even tried\\ncatching fish with her hands as \\nKoss\\n once did, but without success.\\nBeneath Arya\\'s tree, Hot Pie barks like a dog to signal her, an old poacher\\'s trick Kurz taught them. With the\\nnimbleness of a \\nwater dancer\\n, Arya returns to the ground to report her findings. Hot Pie opines that they should go to\\nthe village and ask for food, convinced they will not be killed if they yield. Gendry accuses him of sounding like\\nLommy, who has talked of little else since they escaped from the holdfast. Lommy and Hot Pie insist Lorch would\\nhave left them alone if Yoren had yielded, but Gendry points out that knights and lordlings only take each other\\ncaptive and do not care about the lower classes.\\nHot Pie and Lommy start talking about searching for dead fish, cooking crows, and even hunting boars (which Arya\\nknows they cannot do without boar spears, horses, and men) until Gendry proposes they steal food from the village\\nafter he scouts it out. Arya argues that she should go instead because she is stealthier, but Gendry only agrees that\\n\\nshe can come with him. Hot Pie and Lommy worry about being left for the wolves, and Lommy whines that they\\nshould yield to whomever they find because he needs some potion for his wounded leg. Gendry reminds them that\\nLommy has a spear for the wolves and promises to bring back any leg potion they find, then dons his bull helm and\\nwalks off.\\nDuring their walk, Gendry stops and says he thinks Lommy is going to die. Arya is not surprised since she has felt\\nLommy\\'s warm skin and smelled the stink off his leg. She suggests finding a \\nmaester\\n, but Gendry dismisses it as\\nunlikely. He suggests they should abandon Lommy, since Lommy would do the same and he is sick of Lommy\\'s talk\\nof yielding, adding that Arya is the only one who\\'s good for anything, even if she is a girl. Arya panics and insists\\nshe is not a girl, but Gendry insists he is not stupid and to prove him wrong she will have to pull out her cock.\\nDesperate to escape the subject, Arya brings up the gold cloaks at the inn and says Gendry is also hiding something.\\nGendry insists he does not know why they wanted him and turns the question back on Arya, asking why she thought\\nthey were after her.\\nRealizing her pretense is done, Arya decides she must kill Gendry or trust him and, after pleading that Lommy and\\nHot Pie cannot know, she admits she is Arya of \\nHouse Stark\\n. Gendry is so shocked by the revelation that Arya is a\\nhighborn lady that he becomes unsure how to act around her and begins calling her \"m\\'lady\" and begging her pardon\\nfor talking about cocks and for pissing in front of her. Unsure if he is mocking her, Arya orders him to stop it, since\\neven Hot Pie will notice if he starts calling her that. When Gendry responds by calling her \"m\\'lady\" again, Arya\\nslams into his chest and he falls down, laughing. Then she gives him a kick in the side (which only makes him laugh\\nharder) and sets off for the village, leaving Gendry to hurry after.\\nAs they approach the village, they smell rotting flesh. Gendry decides to circle around to the west while Arya\\ncontinues up the shore, slipping from bush to bush and stopping every few yards to listen. The smell gets worse as\\nshe gets closer and she begins to hear horses and men. Squirming through a gap in a bramble thicket on the edge of\\nthe village, Arya discovers a long gibbet full of corpses so decayed they hardly look like people. Arya forces herself\\nto look at each one in turn, telling herself she is hard as a stone. Beyond the gibbet, two spearmen guard the doors of\\nthe slate-roofed warehouse by the water. Arya cannot make out the two limp banners nearby, but she knows the dead\\nmen must mean Lannisters.\\nThe two guards turn toward a shout from a third man, who appears shoving along a prisoner Arya recognizes as\\nGendry by his bull helm. One of the guards snatches Gendry\\'s helm and, after beating him around a little, they shove\\nhim through the heavy doors of the storehouse. From inside Arya hears sobbing and a loud shriek of pain. Then the\\nwind flutters the banners and she makes out Lannister lion and three black dogs on a yellow field that she feels she\\nshould remember.\\nArya watches for hours as the armored men come and go, as dinner is prepared, and as night falls, but she does not\\nsee an opportunity to free Gendry. Late at night she returns to the others to insist Hot Pie help her free Gendry. Hot\\nPie insists they cannot fight twenty soldiers, but Arya argues they will only have to kill the two guards at the\\nstorehouse. Lommy suggests they should yield or just leave Gendry, but Arya points out they need his to help carry\\nLommy. When Arya insists she is going back to try, Hot Pie reluctantly agrees to come along.\\nAs they are crawling along under the gibbet, a crow lands on Hot Pie\\'s back and the guards hear his gasp. Hot Pie\\nimmediately leaps up and shouts out that he yields. By the time Arya bounces up and draws \\nNeedle\\n, they are\\nsurrounded. She slashes at the nearest man, but he blocks her with a steel-clad arm and someone else knocks her to\\nthe ground. A third man wrenches Needle away and punches her with a armored fist when she tries to bite him.\\nDisoriented, Arya lies hurting and shamed by the loss of Needle, which \\nJon Snow\\n gave her and \\nSyrio Forel\\n taught\\nher to use.\\nWhen she is yanked to her knees, Arya finds herself facing the biggest man she has ever seen, and suddenly she\\nremembers the banner with the three dogs: at the \\nHand\\'s tourney\\n, Sansa told her it was the banner of \\nthe Hound\\n\\'s\\nbrother, Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n, the Mountain that Rides, who is even bigger than \\nHodor\\n. After Hot Pie yields some\\nmore and tells him about Lommy and Weasel, Ser Gregor orders them to lead his men there and walks off. As they\\nwalk back to where Lommy and Weasel are hiding, Hot Pie promises to make pies and tarts for the four soldiers if\\nthey do not hurt him.\\nWhen they arrive, Lommy immediately yields and explains that Weasel ran off when she heard them coming. The\\n\\nsoldiers ask Lommy where they can find \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n, but Lommy has never heard the name. One of the guards\\ndeclares it a waste of time, since Arya\\'s group do not know any more than the villagers. \\nA spearman\\n drifts over to\\nLommy and asks if he can walk. When Lommy says they will have to carry him, the spearman replies \"Think so?\"\\nand casually drives his spear through Lommy\\'s soft throat.\\nNavigation:\\nArya IV\\n↑\\nSansa II\\n ←\\nArya V\\n→ \\nTyrion V\\n↓\\nArya VI\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 20: Tyrion V\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion IV\\n↑\\nArya V\\n ←\\nTyrion V\\n→ \\nBran III\\n↓\\nTyrion VI\\nTyrion\\n visits the \\nGuildhall of the Alchemists\\n to discuss the production of \\nwildfire\\n then meets with Ser \\nCleos Frey\\nabout \\nRobb Stark\\n\\'s peace terms. On the way back to the \\nRed Keep\\n, Tyrion passes a prophet preaching of corruption\\nand incest. When he finds \\nCersei\\n waiting in his solar, the pair argue about strategy and sending \\nMyrcella\\n to \\nDorne\\n,\\nwhich gives Tyrion the identity of an informer.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n is glad he took the advice to dress warmly, despite looking like a ball of striped fur bundled up in his\\nshadowskin\\n cloak. Deep under \\nRhaenys\\'s Hill\\n, the chill in the dank vaults behind the \\nGuildhall of the Alchemists\\n is\\nso bone-deep that even \\nTimett\\n retreated after a brief taste.\\nBy the light of a sealed lamp, Tyrion inspects a fragile, grapefruit-shaped clay jar. The jar has a pebbled texture to\\nkeep it from slipping when grasped, and when Tyrion tilts it to peer inside the murky green \\nwildfire\\n oozes toward\\nthe lip. When Tyrion remarks on its thickness, the pallid and obsequious \\nPyromancer\\n \\nHallyne\\n explains that \"the\\nsubstance\" (as the pyromancers call it) flows more easily as it warms.\\nTyrion is annoyed by the alchemists\\' pretentiousness. Their habits of calling each other \"wisdom\" and hinting at vast\\nstores of secret knowledge do not match the reality of a declining guild in moth-eaten robes who no longer even\\npretend to transmute metals. The \\nMaesters\\n of the \\nCitadel\\n have supplanted the once-powerful guild in almost every\\nrespect―except the creation of wildfire, which remains a closely-guarded guild secret.\\nHallyne explains that once kindled, wildfire cannot be quenched and will seep into cloth, wood, leather, or even\\nsteel and set them afire as well. Tyrion recalls from the flaming sword of \\nThoros of Myr\\n that even a thin coating can\\nburn for an hour, though it ruins the sword. When Tyrion asks why the wildfire doesn\\'t seep into the clay pots,\\nHallyne explains that it does, and thus they have a lower vault full of pots from the reign of King \\nAerys II\\nTargaryen\\n, whose fancy it was to shape the jars like fruit. By rights, those jars should be destroyed, but so many of\\nthe guild\\'s masters were killed during the \\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n that they lack the skill and have flooded the vaults\\ninstead. Hallyne adds that the \\nwhereabouts\\n of much of King Aerys\\'s stock was also lost, such as a cache of two\\nhundred jars discovered only last year under the \\nGreat Sept of Baelor\\n. Hallyne admits this older stock can still be\\nused, but urges extreme caution, since wildfire grows more volatile with age and will self-ignite if left in even direct\\nsunlight for too long, causing it to expand violently and create a chain reaction among nearby jars.\\nWhen Tyrion asks how many jars they have, Hallyne quotes the morning\\'s count by Wisdom \\nMunciter\\n as 7,840 jars,\\nincluding 4,000 from King Aerys\\' older stock and says he is confident the guild will meet its promise of 10,000 jars.\\nTyrion is astonished, delighted, and terrified. He knows creating wildfire is a lengthy and dangerous process, and\\nthought the number was only a wild boast. He insists he does not want any undue haste or defective wildfire, but\\nHallyne assures him the wildfire is prepared only by trained acolytes in work cells designed to fill with sand and\\nsmother any fires―and the hapless acolyte. Tyrion is interested in inspecting how such a cell would work, but he\\ndoes not have time.\\nHallyne reiterates the importance of handling wildfire with care, suggesting that common soldiers in the frenzy of\\nbattle may not be as considerate as trained pyromancers, and any little mistake could be catastrophic. In response,\\n\\nTyrion requests as many spare jars as possible to be delivered to each of the city gates.\\nAs they walk back, Hallyne stresses the honor of welcoming the \\nHand of the King\\n for the first time since Lord\\nRossart\\n, who was of their guild himself. The mention of Rossart reminds Tyrion of the stories of Mad King Aerys II\\nusing the alchemists to burn his enemies, and he decides it would be best to keep \\nJoffrey\\n well away from the\\npyromancers to prevent him getting the same idea. As such, when Hallyne proposes hosting a feast for Joffrey,\\nTyrion explains that Joffrey has forbidden feasting (at Tyrion\\'s insistence) until the war is won. However, Tyrion has\\nno objections when Hallyne instead proposes a demonstration of the \"dread secrets\" of his ancient order at the \\nRed\\nKeep\\n; there is no harm in a few magic tricks.\\nAfter navigating the twists and turns of the Guildhall, they come to the long and echoing Gallery of the Iron\\nTorches, where columns of wildfire flames burn around black metal columns and reflect off the black marble walls\\nto bathe the hall in emerald light. However, Tyrion is less impressed because he knows the cost of wildfire means\\nthe torches have been lit only to impress him.\\nAfter bidding farewell to Hallyne on the doorstep, Tyrion descends the broad steps to the Street of Sisters near\\nVisenya\\'s hill\\n where Timett waits with his litter and an escort of \\nBurned Men\\n, a most appropriate escort for a visit to\\nthe pyromancers and a necessary precaution since Joffrey rained arrows on a hungry mob at the gates of the Red\\nKeep only three days past. Tyrion is surprised to find \\nBronn\\n waiting as well, with two messages: Ser \\nJacelyn\\nBywater\\n urgently requires Tyrion at the \\nGate of the Gods\\n and Cersei commands him to attend her in her chambers.\\nTyrion decides to see Bywater first, as the man is not prone to waste his time and forcing Cersei to wait will make\\nher angry and stupid, which he prefers to composed and cunning.\\nThe normally-busy food market inside the Gate of the Gods is nearly deserted as Tyrion crosses it to meet Ser\\nJacelyn, who informs him that Ser \\nCleos Frey\\n has arrived with peace terms from \\nRobb Stark\\n. Tyrion is pleased, but\\nCleos proves reluctant to discuss the terms since his orders are to deliver them directly to Cersei. Gaunt and haggard\\nfrom his journey, Cleos describes the dire situation around the \\nGods Eye\\n and the \\nkingsroad\\n, where the river lords are\\nburning their own crops to starve the Lannisters, who are in turn torching every village and killing the smallfolk.\\nTyrion dismisses this as the way of war while Cleos adds that even with a peace banner his party was attacked twice\\nby \\nbroken men\\n, losing three men and another six wounded.\\nWhen Tyrion is amused by Robb\\'s impossible peace terms, Cleos shares that Robb sits idle at \\nRiverrun\\n, likely afraid\\nto face Lord \\nTywin\\n in battle, and grows weaker as the river lords disperse to defend their lands. Tyrion wonders if\\nthat was his father\\'s plan, then informs Cleos that the terms―including the exchange of \\nWillem Lannister\\n and Cleos\\'\\nbrother \\nTion Frey\\n for \\nSansa\\n and \\nArya Stark\\n―are unacceptable, and Cleos will be expected to carry the \\nsmall\\ncouncil\\n\\'s counteroffer back to Riverrun. Cleos is not pleased with the prospect of recrossing a war zone and points\\nout that it is \\nCatelyn Stark\\n who wants this peace, not Robb. Tyrion counters that Catelyn wants her daughters and\\nurges Cleos to rest and await further instructions.\\nTyrion rejoins Jacelyn Bywater watching several hundred recruits drilling beyond the gate. With so many refugees,\\nthere is no lack of men joining the \\nCity Watch\\n for food and a bed, but Tyrion has no illusions about their worth in\\nbattle. He commends Bywater for contacting him and instructs him to give Ser Cleos and his escort every hospitality\\nbut to keep them outside the city to hide the truth of conditions there. He also instructs Bywater to use the jars the\\nalchemists will deliver to train spitfire crews to handle wildfire using paint and burning oil. Bywater calls this a wise\\nmeasure, although he has no love for \"alchemist\\'s piss\". Tyrion agrees, but insists he must use what he is given.\\nBack in his litter, Tyrion reflects that if he can use negotiations to keep Robb dreaming of an easy peace at Riverrun\\nuntil Ser \\nStafford Lannister\\n readies his new host at \\nCasterly Rock\\n, then Stafford and Lord Tyrwin can smash Robb\\'s\\nforces between them. Tyrion only wishes the \\nBaratheons\\n would be as accommodating. With \\nRenly\\n creeping up the\\nroseroad\\n with his massive southron army and \\nStannis\\n poised to sail his fleet up the \\nBlackwater Rush\\n any day, Tyrion\\ntakes small comfort from his stockpile of wildfire.\\nA commotion in Cobbler\\'s Square pulls Tyrion out of his musings. A sizable crowd listens to the rantings of a\\nprophet garbed as a \\nbegging brother\\n. Calling the \\nred comet\\n in the sky above \\nAegon\\'s high hill\\n \"the Father\\'s\\nScourge\", he proclaims:\\nWe have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their\\n\\nincest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little \\nmonkey\\n demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools\\nand give birth to monsters! Even the \\nHigh Septon\\n has forgotten the gods! He bathes in scented waters and\\ngrows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, maggots rule our castles, and\\ngold is all... but no more! The Rotten Summer is at an end, and the \\nWhoremonger King\\n is brought low! When\\nthe boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and\\nbiting! There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the gods cry out, lest ye be cleansed! Bathe in the wine\\nof righteousness, or you shall be bathed in fire! Fire!\\nWounded by being called a \"twisted little monkey demon\", Tyrion takes solace from the hoots of derision drowning\\nthe echoing shouts as he orders the Burned Men to clear a path. He agrees with the prophet about the High Septon,\\nhowever, smiling at the memory of a joke \\nMoon Boy\\n made at the gluttonous cleric\\'s expense.\\nReturning to the Red Keep without further incident, Tyrion ascends to his chambers in a hopeful mood, thinking all\\nhe needs is time to piece it all together. Entering his solar, he is confronted by Cersei, who is furious at him for\\nignoring her summons and plotting to sell her only daughter like a bag of oats. Knowing his \\nploy\\n has worked,\\nTyrion points out princesses like \\nMyrcella\\n are born for such marriage alliances, unless Cersei planned to wed her to\\nher brother \\nTommen\\n. Cersei declares she will not allow Myrcella to be shipped off to \\nDorne\\n. Without missing a\\nbeat, Tyrion points out that Dorne will be much safer than King\\'s Landing, and the feud between the Lannisters and\\nHouse Martell\\n goes back only a generation, whereas the Dornishmen have warred with \\nStorm\\'s End\\n and \\nHighgarden\\nfor a millennium.\\nTyrion explains that he proposed nine-year-old Myrcella become a ward of Prince \\nDoran Martell\\n until she turns\\nfourteen, at which time she will marry \\nTrystane Martell\\n, who is just two years older. Cersei insists Myrcella will be\\na hostage, but Tyrion opines that she will be treated more kindly than Sansa Stark, especially with Ser \\nArys\\nOakheart\\n of the \\nKingsguard\\n as her \\nsworn shield\\n. Cersei still worries that Doran Martell might kill Myrcella to\\navenge the murder of his sister \\nElia Martell\\n, but Tyrion insists Doran is too honorable to murder an innocent girl and\\nthe terms are too rich to refuse: he has also promised the prince his sister\\'s killer, a council seat, and some castles on\\nthe \\nDornish Marches\\n. Cersei accuses Tyrion of offering too much without her consent, but he insists Doran would\\nnot accept less and asks if Cersei means to offer sexual favors instead. When she slaps him, Tyrion promises her it\\nwill be the last time, but Cersei only laughs and suggests Tyrion\\'s faith that their father\\'s letter will protect him might\\nbe as misguided as \\nEddard Stark\\n\\'s faith in King \\nRobert\\n\\'s last will. Tyrion notes to himself that unlike Lord Eddard\\nhe has the City Watch, his clansmen, and a party of sellswords, though he supposes Stark had delusions of support\\nas well.\\nRather than argue, Tyrion declares that Renly and Stannis will mount Myrcella\\'s head beside Cersei\\'s if they take the\\ncity. To his astonishment, Cersei begins to cry, something Tyrion has not seen since they were children. Awkwardly\\nhe moves to comfort her, but she wrenches away, which hurts more than any slap. He promises nothing will happen\\nto Myrcella, but Cersei calls him a liar and declares he has not kept his promise to free Jaime. Tyrion assures her\\nthat Jaime remains safe at Riverrun until he can find a way to free him.\\nCersei laments that if she were a man she would not have allowed any of this to happen. She wonders how Jaime\\ncould let himself be captured and questions what their father is doing hiding in \\nHarrenhal\\n. Tyrion assures her Lord\\nTywin is making war, proposing that Tywin is a lion waiting to pounce while Robb is a fawn frozen by fear. Cersei\\nis not convinced, pointing out that Jaime would not sit idle if their father were the prisoner. To himself, Tyrion\\nagrees that Jaime never had any patience, but he only says that not everyone can be as bold as Jaime, but there are\\nother ways to win a war, and Harrenhal is strong and well situated.\\nCersei adds that King\\'s Landing is neither and Renly\\'s host will soon be at their gates. Tyrion assures her the city\\nwill not fall in a day, giving Lord Tywin time to march down the kingsroad to take Renly in the rear. Hungry for\\nreassurance, Cersei asks what will happen if Robb Stark marches. Tyrion explains that Harrenhal prevents \\nRoose\\nBolton\\n from crossing the \\nTrident\\n to reunite the \\nnorthern\\n forces, and even if he could, Robb does not have the\\nstrength to take Harrenhal and march on King\\'s Landing. Meanwhile, Lord Tywin\\'s army lives on the fat of the\\nriverlands\\n and their uncle Stafford is raising another army at Casterly Rock.\\nWondering how Tyrion knows all this, Cersei asks if Lord Tywin confided in him. Tyrion replies that he only\\nlooked at a map, which causes Cersei to accuse him of mere speculation. Drawing out Robb\\'s peace offer, Tyrion\\nasks why Robb would offer terms―even unacceptable terms―if he were winning. Suddenly all queen again, Cersei\\n\\nasks how the terms came to Tyrion instead of her, but Tyrion quips that his job as Hand is to hand her things. As he\\nhands her the letter, Tyrion muses that getting slapped by Cersei is a small price to pay for her agreement to the\\nDornish marriage, which he can sense he will now get. The identity of an informer is just the plum in his pudding.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion IV\\n↑\\nArya V\\n ←\\nTyrion V\\n→ \\nBran III\\n↓\\nTyrion VI\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 21: Bran III\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran II\\n↑\\nTyrion V\\n ←\\nBran III\\n→ \\nCatelyn II\\n↓\\nBran IV\\nActing as Lord of \\nWinterfell\\n, \\nBran\\n hosts the \\nharvest feast\\n and greets \\nMeera\\n and \\nJojen Reed\\n, who arrive to represent\\ntheir father \\nHowland Reed\\n.That night, Bran dreams of the Reeds visiting the \\ndirewolves\\n in the \\ngodswood\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n rides his horse \\nDancer\\n into the Great Hall of \\nWinterfell\\n for the \\nharvest feast\\n. He wishes \\nSummer\\n was with him,\\nbut Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n was unyielding. From the crowded benches, men shout \"Stark!\" and \"Winterfell!\" as he\\npasses. Bran knows they are cheering for the harvest, for victory, and for all the \\nStarks\\n who came before rather than\\nfor him, but he still swells with pride and even forgets he is broken until he reaches the dais. There \\nOsha\\n and \\nHodor\\nunstrap him and carry him to the high seat. Ser Rodrik, his daughter \\nBeth\\n, and \\nMaester\\n \\nLuwin\\n are seated to Bran\\'s\\nleft and \\nRickon\\n to his right, his hair uncut since \\ntheir mother\\n left because he bit the last girl to try. After Ser Rodrik\\nbellows for quiet, Bran welcomes the guests and asks them to thank the gods for \\nRobb\\n\\'s victories and the bountiful\\nharvest. His toast of \"May there be a hundred more,\" brings an echoing cheer and Ser Rodrik says \\nhis father\\n would\\nbe proud.\\nThey feast on course after course, including seafood brought by Lord \\nWyman Manderly\\n from \\nWhite Harbor\\n.\\nManderly has also brought musicians, but only \\nHodor\\n seems to be listening and the songs are drowned beneath the\\ntalk and laughter. Ser Rodrik and Maester Luwin talk over Beth\\'s head, while Rickon screams happily with \\nLittle\\nWalder\\n and \\nBig Walder\\n. Bran did not want the Walders at the high table but Maester Luwin reminded him they\\nwould become kin when Robb weds one of their aunts and Arya marries their uncle \\nElmar Frey\\n, though Bran argued\\nArya would never stand for that.\\nEach dish is served to Bran first, and soon he is full and must nod approval rather than taste everything. As\\ninstructed, he sends particularly delicious dishes to the lords as a gesture of friendship: salmon to sad Lady \\nDonella\\nHornwood\\n, boar to \\nMors\\n and \\nHother Umber\\n, goose-in-berries to \\nCley Cerwyn\\n, lobster to \\nJoseth\\n the master of horse\\nfor training Dancer, sweets to Hodor and Old \\nNan\\n because he loves them, and beets and turnips to the Walders\\nbecause Ser Rodrik insists he give them something.\\nBran watches the feast detachedly, seeing everything yet a part of nothing. He sees Osha break a flagon over the\\nhead of a \\nTallhart\\n man for sliding his hand under her skirts, though another woman does not seem to mind \\nMikken\\n\\'s\\nhand down her bodice. He watches \\nFarlen\\n make his red bitch beg and Old Nan pluck at the crust of a hot pie. On the\\ndais, he sees Lord Manderly attacking a plate of lampreys in his special wide chair, sad Lady Hornwood picking\\nlistlessly at her food, and the Umber brothers playing a drinking game.\\nThe heat and noise soon grow too much and Bran finds himself dreaming of the cool in the \\ngodswood\\n. Studying his\\nfather\\'s ornate goblet, Bran recalls the \\nwelcoming feast\\n for King \\nRobert\\n and realizes everyone else is gone—either to\\nwar, captivity, \\nthe Wall\\n, or their graves. Even the men at the tables are new, since everyone who went south with his\\nfather is dead and the rest rode to war with Robb. When he wonders who will be missing next year and the year\\nafter, Bran feels like crying but reminds himself he is the Stark in Winterfell and almost a man grown.\\nThe doors to the hall open and \\nAlebelly\\n leads in two new guests: \\nMeera\\n and \\nJojen Reed\\n of \\nGreywater Watch\\n. Bran\\nrecognizes them as \\ncrannogmen\\n from \\nthe Neck\\n, a shy and simple folk who rarely leave their swamps, but he hears\\n\\nLittle Walder calling them \"mudmen\" and explaining to Rickon that they are thieves and cravens with green teeth\\nfrom eating frogs. As places are hurriedly prepared on the dais, Ser Rodrik explains that these must be the children\\nof \\nHowland Reed\\n, a great friend and staunch companion of Bran\\'s father during \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n.\\nThe slender girl Meera is armed with woven net, bronze knife, and frog spear as well as an iron helm, leather shield,\\nand bronze-scale jerkin. Her younger brother Jojen is unarmed and dressed all in green, which brings out the deep\\ngreen of his eyes. Kneeling before the dais, the Reeds explain that they have come to renew \\nHouse Reed\\n\\'s fealty to\\nthe \\nKing in the North\\n. Bran explains that Robb is away fighting but says they may say their words to him. Together,\\nthe Reeds recite their ancient oath, swearing by earth and water, by bronze and iron, and by ice and fire never to fail\\nthe Starks of Winterfell. Unsure how to respond, Bran finally decides on \"May your winters be short and your\\nsummers bountiful,\" and bids them rise. Meera offers gifts of fish, frog, and fowl, and Bran offers them the meat and\\nmead of Winterfell in return.\\nJojen immediately asks where the \\ndirewolves\\n are and Rickon answers that they are in the godswood because\\nShaggydog\\n was bad. When Meera says that Jojen would like to see them, Little Walder warns that they will bite.\\nPleased by the Reeds\\' interest, Bran promises that Summer at least will not bite and will keep Shaggydog away. He\\ncannot recall ever meeting a crannogman and would like to talk more, but the feast is too noisy. When he learns\\nfrom Ser Rodrik that they truly eat frogs, Bran sends the Reeds mutton, \\naurochs\\n, and beef stew, which they seem to\\nlike. When Meera catches him staring, Bran blushes.\\nAfter the tables are cleared away, the music and singing grows wilder. Mors Umber grabs a passing serving girl and\\nbegins whirling her about the floor and others soon join in. Hodor dances by himself, while Wyman Manderly and\\nthen Cley Cerwyn partner with little Beth Cassel. Ser Rodrik approaches Lady Hornwood, but she excuses herself.\\nOnce again unable to participate, Bran watches long enough to be polite, then calls Hodor to carry him to bed,\\nconscious of the stares of onlookers.\\nJust outside the hall, they come upon Joseth and giggling woman with her skirts above her waist. The girl screams\\nwhen she sees Hodor watching, so Bran has to tell him to leave them be. After getting help with his boots and\\nbreeches, Bran dismisses Hodor and lies down to sleep. Then he recalls his father telling him the \\nKingsguard\\n were\\nonce a shining example, and the finest knight he ever saw was Ser \\nArthur Dayne\\n, who would have killed him but for\\nHowland Reed. His father became sad at that and spoke no further, but now Bran wishes he had asked what he\\nmeant.\\nBran goes to sleep thinking of knights, but his dreams are of wolves in the godswood again and he can hear and\\nsmell the feast still going on. At the rattle of iron, he and his brother race to confront the strange intruders: a female\\nand a young male with no taint of fear. Bran recognizes Meera\\'s voice when she asks if Jojen knew the wolves\\nwould be so big. Jojen points out they are still growing and opines that Shaggydog is full of fear and rage but\\nSummer is stronger than he knows. Meera cautions her brother, but Jojen insists this is not the day he dies and\\nreaches out to touch Summer. At his touch, Bran loses contact and suddenly feels he is falling again.\\nNavigation:\\nBran II\\n↑\\nTyrion V\\n ←\\nBran III\\n→ \\nCatelyn II\\n↓\\nBran IV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 22: Catelyn II\\nPlace(s): \\nBitterbridge\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn I\\n↑\\nBran III\\n ←\\nCatelyn II\\n→ \\nJon III\\n↓\\nCatelyn III\\nAs envoy to King \\nRenly Baratheon\\n, \\nCatelyn\\n arrives at \\nBitterbridge\\n to find \\na great melee\\n in progress. Afterward, the\\nchampion \\nBrienne of Tarth\\n is granted her request to become one of Renly\\'s \\nRainbow Guard\\n. That night Catelyn\\nattends a feast and meets privately with Renly, who insists \\nRobb\\n must bend the knee to him. Then, a messenger\\narrives with news that King \\nStannis Baratheon\\n has besieged \\nStorm\\'s End\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nA cruel dawn wakes \\nCatelyn\\n from sweet dreams of happy family life. She is weary of riding, hurting, and being\\nstrong, but she knows she cannot allow herself to be weak today. Outside her tent, she finds \\nShadd\\n stirring oats into\\na kettle. Ser \\nWendel Manderly\\n suggests supplementing this with roast quail, but Catelyn decides oats and bread are\\nsufficient since they have many leagues to travel.\\nHer party includes twenty of \\nRobb\\n\\'s best \\nWinterfell\\n men and five lordlings, including Ser Wendel, Ser \\nPerwyn Frey\\n,\\nLucas Blackwood\\n, and \\nRobin Flint\\n, to add weight and honor to her negotiations with King \\nRenly\\n. It is a mission\\nCatelyn never wanted, but Robb insisted he had no one else: Lord \\nHoster Tully\\n was too ill, and he needed Ser\\nBrynden Tully\\n to command his scouts and Ser \\nEdmure Tully\\n to hold \\nRiverrun\\n when he marched. Catelyn argued\\nthat marching was rash, but Robb insisted waiting would make him look afraid and weaken his position, especially\\nsince \\nLysa Arryn\\n will not support him. Catelyn feared he planned to play into \\nTywin Lannister\\n\\'s hand and march on\\nHarrenhal\\n, but Robb countered that he said nothing of Harrenhal. Catelyn smiles at the memory of Robb\\'s obvious\\nploy of threatening to send \\nGreatjon Umber\\n in her place, given how ill-suited the Greatjon is to treat with a man like\\nRenly. Before leaving, she wrote to \\nBran\\n and \\nRickon\\n and visited her father but he mistook her for \\nher mother\\n.\\nHalf a day\\'s ride from Renly\\'s camp they are spotted from a windmill and intercepted by Ser \\nColen of Greenpools\\nwith twenty men. When Catelyn announces herself as the envoy of the \\nKing in the North\\n, Ser Colen insists that\\nRenly is king of all the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n and escorts her to his camp at \\nBitterbridge\\n, where the \\nroseroad\\n crosses the\\nMander\\n. With nearly all the chivalry of the south behind him, Renly\\'s camp is immense. Thousands of cookfires\\ncloud the air and a vast menagerie of banners fly from a veritable forest of staffs. Monstrous siege engines line the\\nroad, tents and pavilions dot the landscape, and the whole place bustles with people. Everywhere Catelyn sees the\\ngolden rose of \\nHouse Tyrell\\n and across the river Renly and his \\nstorm lords\\n have raised their own standards. Catelyn\\nrecognizes many of the sigils, but for each one she knows there are a dozen she does not, all assembled to make\\nRenly a king.\\nPassing through a line of pavilions, they come upon \\na tourney melee\\n taking place beneath the battlements of a small\\ncastle. Less than a score of contestants remain ahorse, cheered on by hundreds of spectators. Since penetrating the\\ncrowd proves difficult, Ser Colen asks that Catelyn\\'s escort wait while he presents her to the king. A roar goes up\\nwhen a knight of \\nHouse Tarth\\n in cobalt armor unhorses \\nRed Ronnet Connington\\n, but the carnage makes Catelyn\\nthink it mad for Renly to be playing at war with real enemies all around.\\nAmong the lords and ladies in the gallery, Catelyn recognizes stout Lord \\nMathis Rowan\\n, delicate Lady \\nArwyn\\nOakheart\\n, and martial Lord \\nRandyll Tarly\\n, but others she knows only by sigil or not at all. The handsome King\\nRenly sits in their midst, looking like a youthful ghost of his brother \\nRobert\\n and laughing with his young queen\\nMargaery Tyrell\\n, a girl of Robb\\'s age with a shy smile and curly brown hair. Catelyn knows their marriage is the\\n\\nmortar of the great southron alliance, and the rose sigil and green-and-gold colors of House Tyrell are prominent in\\nRenly\\'s slender crown and velvet tunic.\\nOut on the field, only four men remain and both king and commons obviously favor young Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n in his\\nsilver mail and rainbow cloak. Two others ally against the blue-clad knight from Tarth but are quickly unhorsed.\\nForced to discard his now-broken shield for the final duel, the blue knight is at a disadvantage and soon disarmed by\\nSer Loras. Yet as Loras prepares the final blow, the blue knight charges into it, grapples him to the ground, and\\nopens Tyrell\\'s visor with a dirk to make him to yield.\\nAs the blue knight salutes the king in victory, squires rush to help Loras Tyrell remove his helm and Catelyn is\\nstartled by his youth and beauty. Renly then bids the champion to approach and there are a few cries of \"Tarth!\" and,\\noddly, \"A Beauty!\" but most remain silent. Renly declares the blue knight to be all his father claimed since Loras is\\nrarely unhorsed, but Catelyn overhears accusations of trickery from the crowd. When she asks why the man in blue\\nis so disliked, Ser Colen explains that the champion is no man but \\nBrienne of Tarth\\n, the daughter of Lord \\nSelwyn the\\nEvenstar\\n, who is often called \"Brienne the Beauty,\" though never to her face.\\nKing Renly officially declares Brienne the champion as the last mounted of 116 knights and offers her any reward\\nwithin his power. Brienne asks to be made one of his seven \\nRainbow Guard\\n and Renly agrees. It is only when\\nBrienne removes her greathelm that Catelyn understands Ser Colen\\'s words: the only thing beautiful about Brienne\\nare her girlish blue eyes. Her face is broad, coarse, and freckled, with a large mouth full of crooked teeth and a nose\\nthat has been broken more than once. Catelyn is filled with pity for the girl, yet Brienne looks anything but\\nunfortunate when Renly fastens the rainbow cloak to her shoulders, and her face lights up with a smile as she\\nproudly pledges to give her life for him.\\nSer Colen interjects to introduce Catelyn, though she needs to insist that Robb is King in the North as well as Lord\\nof Winterfell. Renly looks surprised, but greets her warmly and introduces his queen, who offers condolences for her\\nhusband\\'s death. Renly even swears to bring her \\nCersei Lannister\\n\\'s head when he takes \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, but Catelyn\\nreplies that justice will be enough. Brienne of Tarth notes that Catelyn should kneel and refer to the king as \"Your\\nGrace,\" but Catelyn insists they have more pressing matters to discuss. Some of Renly\\'s lords bristle, but the king\\nonly laughs and asks when Robb plans to march on Harrenhal. Unsure whether Renly will be a friend or a foe,\\nCatelyn only replies that she does not sit on the war council. Renly asks about \\nJaime Lannister\\n and, learning he is a\\nprisoner, declares that the direwolf is gentler than the lion. Lord Randyll Tarly pipes up that Robb should have come\\nto pay homage in person, but Catelyn counters that her son is fighting a war, not playing at one. Renly grins and\\nwarns Lord Tarly that he is outmatched, then offers Catelyn the use of his own pavilion (since he is guesting at Lord\\nLorent Caswell\\n\\'s castle) and invites her to the evening\\'s farewell feast.\\nRenly\\'s pavilion is so massive and richly furnished that Catelyn understands why his host moves so slowly, and that\\nevening she is seated between Mathis Rowan and Ser \\nJon Fossoway\\n. Meanwhile, Brienne of Tarth is seated at the\\nfar end of the high table in knight\\'s garments instead of a lady\\'s and Catelyn notes that out of her armor Brienne\\nlooks muscular, plain, and ungainly, and judges from the woman\\'s actions that she knows it.\\nSingers and tumblers entertain them, and the food is rich and plentiful, but Catelyn eats only sparingly and watches\\nthose around her. King Renly speaks amiably to all and sometimes feeds Queen Margaery choice morsels or kisses\\nher lightly, but it is Ser Loras who shares most in his jests and confidences. Others are less moderate: the brothers\\nJosua\\n and \\nElyas Willum\\n dispute who will be first over the walls of King\\'s Landing, Lord \\nVarner\\n dandles a serving\\ngirl, Ser \\nGuyard Morrigen\\n sings a bad song about knotting lions\\' tails, Ser \\nMark Mullendore\\n feeds his pet \\nmonkey\\nfrom his plate, and Ser \\nTanton Fossoway\\n climbs onto the table and swears to slay \\nSandor Clegane\\n in single combat.\\nWhen a gold-dressed fool and a dwarf elicit gales of laughter by mocking Jaime and \\nTyrion Lannister\\n, Lord Rowan\\nremarks to Catelyn that Renly and his favorites are all very young. Seeing Lord \\nBryce Caron\\n goad Ser \\nRobar Royce\\ninto juggling daggers, Catelyn recalls that none of them are old enough to have seen war, so they think it is a game\\nand believe themselves immortal. She tells Lord Rowan that war will make them old, as it did her generation, and\\nsays she pities them because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming. Brienne chimes in to disagree,\\nsaying:\\nWinter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it’s always\\nsummer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.\\n\\nCatelyn knows that winter comes for everyone, as it did for her when Ned died, but King Renly saves her from\\nhaving to say so by asking her to take the air with him. Brienne wants to come along as well, but Renly insists\\nanother sword will make no difference in the midst of his own army. Brienne seems very hurt by the refusal.\\nAs they walk, Renly asks if Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n has joined Robb at Riverrun. When Catelyn seems puzzled, Renly\\ntells her of Selmy\\'s dismissal and his vow to serve the true king, adding that Brienne\\'s position in the Rainbow\\nGuard was meant for Selmy. Next, Renly explains that he offered Ned a hundred swords to seize Joffrey but fled\\nwhen refused because he lacked the strength to act alone and feared Cersei meant to kill him after Robert died. He\\nadds that he liked Ned well enough and knew him to be Robert\\'s loyal friend, but says Ned would not listen or bend.\\nLeading her out onto the roof, Renly shows Catelyn his army\\'s countless campfires and asks how many fires burn\\naround Riverrun. He guesses that Robb has 40,000 men at most, though Catelyn knows the real number is much\\nlower. Renly declares that he has twice as many with him, and another 10,000 with \\nMace Tyrell\\n at Highgarden, a\\nstrong garrison at \\nStorm\\'s End\\n, and soon all the power of \\nDorne\\n and his brother \\nStannis Baratheon\\n on \\nDragonstone\\n.\\nCatelyn counters sharply that Renly seems to have forgotten that Stannis has the better claim. Renly replies that\\nStannis is respected and feared but not loved and would make an appalling king. Gesturing to his army, Renly\\ndeclares that his claim is as good as Robert\\'s ever was.\\nThen he offers terms: Robb can rule in Winterfell and even go on calling himself King in the North, but he must\\nbend the knee to Renly as his overlord. When Catelyn asks the consequences of refusal, Renly insists he means to be\\nking of a united realm and reminds her that \\nTorrhen Stark\\n was wise to yield to \\nAegon I Targaryen\\n, adding that if\\nthey join together the war is good as done.\\nJust then, a messenger rides into the yard with news that \\nStorm\\'s End\\n is under attack, although Ser \\nCortnay Penrose\\ndefies the besiegers. When Renly protests that he would know if Lord Tywin had left Harrenhal, the messenger\\nreplies that these are no Lannisters; it Lord Stannis at the gates, calling himself \\nKing\\n Stannis.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn I\\n↑\\nBran III\\n ←\\nCatelyn II\\n→ \\nJon III\\n↓\\nCatelyn III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 23: Jon III\\nPlace(s): \\nCraster\\'s Keep\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon II\\n↑\\nCatelyn II\\n ←\\nJon III\\n→ \\nTheon II\\n↓\\nJon IV\\nThe \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n finally finds people at \\nCraster\\'s Keep\\n. \\nCraster\\n has been an ally to the Watch, but he has an\\nunsavory reputation. \\nJon Snow\\n discovers that Craster marries his daughters and gives his young sons to the Cold\\nGods. Jon gets the opportunity to talk to one of Craster’s wives, \\nGilly\\n, about this, and learns that the Cold Gods have\\nbright blue eyes like the \\nwights\\n that attacked \\nJeor Mormont\\n. The next day, Jon rides with the Lord Commander,\\ntelling him about Craster’s sons and daughters, and learns that the commander knew. Then the commander tells him\\nthat Craster informed them that \\nMance Rayder\\n is gathering his people at \\nFrostfangs\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nJon Snow\\n is riding beside a grumpy \\nLord Commander\\n with an equally soaked and grumpy raven on his shoulder.\\nThere have been six days of rain, and the ground is treacherous; Jon thinks about \\nPypar\\n and \\nTodder\\n sitting near the\\nfire in the common room. The Lord Commander is relieved when he hears \\nJarmen Buckwell\\n’s horn—it means there\\nare still people at \\nCraster\\'s Keep\\n. They have so far passed through seven villages without seeing anybody. Jon has\\nheard many tales about \\nCraster\\n. \\nThoren Smallwood\\n swears he is a friend of the watch, though he has an unsavory\\nreputation: \\nDywen\\n says he is a kinslayer, liar, raper, craven, and slaver. The Lord Commander tells Jon to spread the\\nword down the column that he wants no trouble with Craster’s women, and the men will mind their hands and avoid\\ntalking to the women.\\nAs he rides down the line, he finally comes to \\nSam\\n with the baggage. The ravens are very unruly, and Sam explains\\nthat they hate the rain like men. Sam states he is doing alright, but wet, and when he is told that Craster’s Keep is\\njust ahead, he tells Jon that \\nEddison Tollett\\n says Craster marries his daughters, only follows his own laws, and that\\nDywen told \\nGrenn\\n he has black blood. Also, that his mother is \\na wilding\\n that laid with a ranger. Sam almost goes on\\nto call Craster a bastard, but Jon finishes for him, and says he has heard the word before. Jon finally makes it to the\\nrear to give word to Ser \\nOttyn Wythers\\n, who considers it welcome news; he has always looked tired, but the rain has\\nmade him look much worse.\\nOn the way back up the column, Jon cuts through the woods. When he hears rustling, he thinks it is \\nGhost\\n, but it is\\nDywen and Grenn. Jon gives them the news that Craster is alive, and discussion turns to how many wives he has.\\nThen Ghost is loping beside Jon’s horse. Jon rides ahead to the keep.\\nWhen he gets to the keep, he is very disappointed. He did not expect a stone castle, but what he finds, he would call\\na midden heap. Inside the compound he sees a little naked girl pulling carrots, and two women tie a pig for\\nslaughter. He can hear \\nChett\\n’s hounds\\' barking being answered by the bark of Craster’s dogs. Some of the dogs\\nbreak off when they see Ghost, while others growl and Ghost ignores them. Jon estimates that only 30 or maybe 50\\nwill get to sleep in the hall, but not their 200. Dolorous Edd has been entrusted with the commander’s mount and\\ntells Jon that he is to join the commander in the hall, but the wolf should stay outside.\\nInside the squalid, foul smelling hall, there are already two dozen rangers, including Jarman Buckwell and Thoren\\nSmallwood. Jon thinks how he looked forward to seeing the wonders beyond the wall—it is a pity Pypar and Todder\\nare missing this. Craster is the only one sitting in a chair, even the commander has to sit on a bench, and seeing him\\nJon thinks of Old \\nNan\\n’s tales of wildlings drinking blood from human skulls. He overhears Craster say he has not\\nseen \\nBrandon Stark\\n for three years. In the background, shabbily dressed women prepare the food and pass out beer\\n\\nwhile a dozen puppies and a pig skulk around. Mormont tells Crater that Ben was searching for the vanished Ser\\nWaymar Royce\\n, \\nGared\\n and \\nWill\\n. Craster recalls the three men, but does not know where they went. He does\\ncomplain that his wives made cow eyes at young Ser Waymar who was too proud to sleep under his roof. The\\ncommander tells him about the villages they found abandoned, and the \\nwights\\n that attacked him at \\nCastle Black\\n.\\nCraster feigns ignorance, but one of his wives recognizes the truth in the tale by the look of horror on her face.\\nCraster also refuses the offer of an escort back to \\nthe Wall\\n, saying he is of the free folk. He even has his wife\\nconfirm that this is their place, Craster keeps them safe, and it is better to die free. Jarmen Buckwell asks about\\nCraster’s king, \\nMance Rayder\\n, and Craster states that Free Folk have no need of kings, and that when one of\\nMance’s men arrived to tell him he had to leave his keep and grovel at Mance’s feet, he sent the man back without\\nhis tongue.\\nCraster then tells the commander that they can sleep on the floor, but he will only feed 20. Mormont responds that\\nthe roof would be welcome, and they have food and wine which they will share. Craster expresses particular interest\\nin the wine and then adds that any man that lays a hand on one of his wives loses his hand. Mormont agrees, but\\ndoes not look pleased. Craster now asks if Mormont has a man that can draw maps, and Jon steps forward stating\\nthat Sam likes maps. Mormont tells Jon to get Sam with quill and parchment and bring Mormont’s axe as a guest\\ngift. Craster notes that Jon Snow has the look of a Stark, and is told that he is Mormont’s steward and squire. When\\nCraster hears the name Snow, he understands that Jon is a bastard, and declares that a man who wants to bed a\\nwoman should marry her like he does, and then tells Jon to do his service.\\nJon almost collides into Ottyn Wythers as he is leaving. Outside he finds tents have gone up all over the compound.\\nHe finds Dolorous Edd and tells him of the requests. Edd states that the commander will get his axe back, buried in\\nhis skull. When he hears that the commander wants wine as well, he says that Craster, drunk, will only cut off an ear\\nwhen he attempts to slay them. When Jon tells Dolorous Edd that Smallwood says Craster is their friend, he\\nresponds the difference between wildling friends and enemies is that the friends bury them in secret graves.\\nJon hears a shout of fear as he finishes up feeding the horses. He finds Ghost with two rabbits confronting a 15 year\\nold girl. Jon promises that Ghost will not hurt her. He asks her if she is one of Craster’s daughters and is told she is\\nnow his wife. She was hoping to breed the rabbits. Jon can tell that Ghost has gone after the caged rabbits; he must\\nhave been hungry. He would pay for them but has no money, so he tells her that the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n will make good.\\nShe calls him lord and he responds he is no lord. Then ranger \\nLark\\n the Sisterman tells her that he is Lord Snow\\nhimself, and then notes that the wolf is looking hungry. Jon tells Lark that he is scaring her, only to have Chett\\nrespond that Lark is warning her. The girl then remembers she is not to talk to them. Chett tells Jon that he would\\nnot be so bold without Ghost around; Chett lost is position as Maester \\nAemon\\n\\'s steward because of Jon. When Lark\\njoins in about Jon being a coward without his wolf, he leaves.\\nIt takes a while for Jon to find Sam, and it is actually Ghost that finds him under a rock outcrop. Ghost has given Jon\\nthe second rabbit, and Jon shows Sam and then informs him that the commander wants him to create a map. Jon\\nproceeds to cook the scrawny rabbit over a fire. It smells wonderful and the other rangers give them envious looks.\\nAs they eat, Sam asks if Craster is a savage, as they say. After Sam leaves with the quill and parchment, Jon falls\\nasleep thinking that maybe the commander will learn something that will lead them to Uncle Benjen.\\nHe wakes to dawn, and Ghost is gone. Everything is coated in a fine ice glaze, and Jon thinks of his sisters, and that\\nSansa would call this enchantment. He hears his name called and finds the girl with the rabbits wearing Sam’s cloak.\\nShe asks him if he is the king’s brother, and he tells her he is his half-brother. Jon is concerned about Craster, but\\nGilly\\n tells him her father drank too much and will sleep most of the day. She then asks him about King’s justice; she\\nwants to leave. Craster should not even notice since he has 19 wives. She explains that she is pregnant, and while it\\nwill not be too bad if she has a girl, since Craster will let her grow up and marry her, if it is boy, he will give it to the\\ngods. Nella has told her that the baby will be male, and Gilly believes she knows these things, having had six boys.\\nShe continues by telling Jon that when the white cold comes, he sacrifices the boys, and it has been coming more\\noften, so he has had to give the sheep, which are now gone. Next it will be the dogs. The Cold Gods come at night,\\nand are white shadows. Jon thinks about the two wights, asks the color of their eyes and is told they are bright blue.\\nShe tells him that she knows he did not take of Craster’s hospitality, so Jon is not bound to Craster, and asks to be\\ntaken to the Wall, but Jon tells her that they are going the other direction, and that it is for the old crow to decide, not\\nhim. Disappointed, she leaves.\\nHe joins Dywen, Grenn and Hake for breakfast. Dywen claims he had three of the woman that night. He is not\\n\\nbelieved. Jon asks if Sam slept in the hall, and is told that it was impossible to sleep with the hard ground, the ill-\\nsmelling rushes, and the snoring, particularly the snoring of \\nBrown Bernarr\\n. Jon soon excuses himself to attend to\\nthe Lord Commander.\\nOn the way, he passes by the scouts, and Jarman Buckwell tells him to keep a good edge on his sword since they\\nwill be needing it soon enough. When he enters the hall, the commander’s Raven announces his presence with a\\nrequest for corn. When the commander asks, Jon tells him the rain has stopped but it is cold. Mormont tells him to\\nsaddle his horse for he plans to leave within the hour. He tells Jon that there is some food, but Jon declines, deciding\\nhe will not take of Craster’s hospitality.\\nHe finds Sam behind the hall with Gilly. She quietly leaves and Sam tells Jon he was hoping he could do something\\nfor Gilly. Jon asks what he could have done, wrap her in a cloak and take her with them? Sam admits Jon is right,\\nbut she is afraid, and maybe when they come back they can take her. Jon states the commander will not let them take\\none of Craster’s wives, then quickly excuses himself because he has to groom and saddle the horses.\\nAs he rides alongside Mormont, Jon notes that Craster has no sons or sheep. Mormont admits that Craster gives his\\nsons to the wood, and tells Jon that all the rangers know, but will not talk of it. If he could have, Mormont states, he\\nwould have taken the boys, they could raise them to the black, but the wildlings serve crueler gods. Mormont then\\nasks if Jon spoke to one of Craster’s wives, and Jon admits he did. Then Mormont tells Jon that if he had his way,\\nwith Craster sprawled out drunk and the new axe below, one of the wives could easily kill him. However, the Night\\'s\\nWatch need Craster, and his keep has been responsible for saving many ranger lives. Mormont can tell Jon wants to\\nsay something, and tells him to. Jon states that his father said that a brutal or unjust bannerman shames his liege\\nlord. Mormont responds that Craster is his own man and has sworn no vows.\\nAfter Jon informs Mormont that Buckwell has told him he would soon need his sword, Mormont explains that\\nCraster told them Mance Rayder is gathering his people at \\nFrostfangs\\n, a cruel, inhospitable wilderness of stone and\\nice. Mormont expects Mance to invade the realm. Jon mentions that \\nRaymun Redbeard\\n in the time of his\\ngrandfather\\'s grandfather, and before that \\nBael the Bard\\n, invaded the realm. Mormont admits this, adding more\\nnames including \\nJoramun\\n, who blew the Horn of Winter to wake the giants, but not only is the Watch a shadow of\\nitself, Winterfell is weak with \\nRobb Stark\\n marching south. This is a great opportunity for the wildlings. Their only\\nchoice is to find Mance Rayder and stop him.\\nNavigation:\\nJon II\\n↑\\nCatelyn II\\n ←\\nJon III\\n→ \\nTheon II\\n↓\\nJon IV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 24: Theon II\\nPlace(s): \\nLordsport\\n and \\nPyke\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTheon I\\n↑\\nJon III\\n ←\\nTheon II\\n→ \\nTyrion VI\\n↓\\nTheon III\\nTheon Greyjoy\\n meets an \\nironborn\\n woman calling herself Esgred while admiring his \\nnew longship\\n. Immediately\\ntaken by her, Theon responds to her flirtations, eventually offering her a ride to \\nhis father\\'s\\n \\ncastle\\n. They continue to\\nflirt on route to \\nPyke\\n, but upon their arrival, Theon discovers that Esgred is actually his older sister, \\nAsha\\n. At the\\nfeast held by Lord \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n that evening, Asha sits in the seat to Balon\\'s right, a place of high honor. Theon\\nand Asha later join their father and two uncles, \\nVictarion\\n and \\nAeron\\n, in Balon\\'s solar, where Balon reveals his plans.\\nTheon is furious to discover that he has been given the least important mission.\\nSynopsis\\nTheon Greyjoy is at the docks at \\nLordsport\\n, admiring his \\nnew longship\\n. He is approached by a striking ironborn\\nwoman calling herself Esgred. Theon is taken by her and immediately begins to flirt. Although she responds to\\nTheon\\'s flirtations, Esgred informs him that she is married and pregnant. Theon is not bothered by this, telling her\\nthat he cannot father a \\nbastard\\n on her if she is pregnant and attempting to sway her by informing her he is a prince.\\nWhen he asks whether he should name his ship after her, Esgred tells him that he should, as she has she build his\\nship. She informs him she is the daughter of \\nAmbrode\\n and the wife of \\nSigrin\\n, the shipwright. When Theon claims\\nshe is wasted on Sigrin, she in turn claims that, according to Sigrin, the ship is wasted on Theon. She asks what\\nTheon thinks of his new ship, but when Theon calls the ship a \"fair maiden\", Esgred states she is a sea bitch. Theon\\ndeclares \\nSea Bitch\\n to be the name of his new ship, which will be blessed by his uncle \\nAeron\\n, a priest of the \\nDrowned\\nGod\\n, the next day.\\nThey flirt some more, but Esgred continues to refuse to sleep with him. She does accept Theon\\'s invitation to a feast\\nheld by Lord \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n at Pyke that evening. Together, they walk through \\nLordsport\\n, crowded with the men of\\nthe newly arrived Lord \\nGorold Goodbrother\\n of \\nGreat Wyk\\n, to the \\ninn\\n to find Theon\\'s horse and squire. Theon is glad\\nto notice that the people grow quiet as they pass and acknowledge them with bows, considering it a sign of respect\\nto him. On their way to the inn, Esgred inquires whether Theon has already assembled a crew. When Esgred calls\\nout to several men she is familiar with, Theon comes to realize that he has been away from Pyke for a long time and\\nthat any friends he once had are now strangers to him. He tells Esgred that his uncle \\nVictarion\\n has loaned him his\\nsteersman, \\nRymolf Stormdrunk\\n. As they pass the \\nMyraham\\n, which has not yet been allowed to leave by Lord Balon,\\nthe \\ncaptain\\'s daughter\\n on board calls out to Theon, who admits to Esgred that he has slept with her.\\nAt the inn Theon finds his squire, \\nWex Pyke\\n, whom he orders to saddle his warhorse \\nSmiler\\n, which he had\\npurchased from Lord \\nSawane Botley\\n. Esgred is impressed by Theon\\'s horse and rides double with Theon to Pyke,\\nsitting in front of him. During the ride, he frequently attempts to fondle her breasts, but she removes his hands each\\ntime. When she asks Lord Balon will welcome her, Theon tells her that he himself had hardly been welcomed.\\nEsgred questions Theon’s status as heir as he has brothers, uncles, and his sister. He tells her that his brothers are\\ndead and that he’ll find a husband for his sister \\nAsha\\n. His uncles, however, are a sore point. Although his own claim\\nis stronger, it is not unheard of on the \\nIron Islands\\n for an uncle to dispose of a weak nephew. Theon claims Aeron\\nonly cares for the Drowned God, Victarion is tireless and dutiful, and Euron is most likely dead, having been gone\\nfrom the islands for two years. Esgred admits that Euron may be dead and that if he is alive he would be half a\\nstranger, which would make it unlikely that the ironborn would seat him on the \\nSeastone Chair\\n. Theon is bothered\\nby the thought, as his absence of ten years has made him more of a stranger than Euron. Regardless, he is\\ndetermined to prove himself worthy.\\n\\nDuring the remainder of the journey they speak of the feast, \\nTheon\\'s mother\\n, who resides at \\nHarlaw\\n, and Esgred\\'s\\npregnancy. She eventually asks about \\nRobb Stark\\n and his war against the \\nLannisters\\n, and Theon tells her about the\\nbattles they have fought. As they arrive at Pyke, however, Theon discovers to his horror that Esgred is actually Asha\\nwhen the stableboy addresses her by her name. Asha reveals she arrived with Lord Goodbrother the night before and\\nhad stayed a night at the inn. As Theon gapes at her, she tells him that kept silent about her identity because she\\nwanted to see who he was first. Asha leaves and Theon takes his anger out on Wex, who is smirking at him. Theon\\nretreats to his chambers, angry, thinking how Asha made a fool of him and how he has no place at Pyke because of\\nher. When he hears the distant music he dresses for Balon\\'s feast, deciding to wear only plain clothes while cursing\\nthe fact that he has no ornaments \"bought with iron\".\\nAt the hall Lord Balon is feasting near four hundred lords and captains. All the houses of the Iron Islands are present\\nexcept for \\nHouse Stonehouse\\n and \\nHouse Drumm\\n, who have yet to arrive. At the dais, Balon comments that Theon is\\nlate. Theon sits down next to Asha, who is siting at Balon\\'s right in a place of high honor. When Theon hisses to her\\nthat she is in his seat, she replies that his place is at \\nWinterfell\\n and asks where his pretty clothes are. When Theon\\nasks if every word she told him was a lie, she says not. Calling out to one of the dancers, \\nRolfe\\n, Asha catches a\\nflying axe\\n and splits Theon’s trencher with it, telling him the axe is her husband. She then pulls a dirk from between\\nher breasts and tells him it is her suckling babe. Theon realizes the entire hall is laughing at him. As Asha sits back\\ndown, she tells him he should learn about the isles and the people on them, asking him why they should die for\\nTheon if he does not know them. Theon insists he is their prince, but Asha counters that the ironborn do not follow\\nthe laws of the green lands, but rather make their own.\\nFinally Lord Balon rises, telling them to join him in his solar when they are finished. After arguing with Asha,\\nTheon leaves and crosses the rope bridge to the \\nSea Tower\\n, where he finds his father and two uncles, Victarion and\\nAeron\\n, in the damp, drafty solar. On seeing him, Balon tells him it is time he heard his plans, refusing to hear any of\\nTheon\\'s suggestions. He tells Theon that he will command eight ships to \\nharrying of the Stony Shore\\n, accompanied\\nby Aeron and \\nDagmer\\n. Theon feels slapped, feeling the work is beneath him and that the inclusion of Aeron and\\nDagmer indicates that Balon does not trust him. As Asha slips in, Balon tells them that she will take thirty ships with\\npicked men to take \\nDeepwood Motte\\n. Victarion is to make the main thrust at \\nMoat Cailin\\n, sailing up the \\nSaltspear\\nand the \\nFever River\\n. Once they hold Moat Cailin Robb Stark will not be able to return north. Theon tries to tell\\nBalon that the lords hold the castles, but again Balon shuts him up, saying the lords have gone south with Robb.\\nWinterfell may hold out for a year, but the rest shall be theirs.\\nTheon leaves the solar, but on the rope bridge a sudden gust of wind causes him to stumble to his knees. Asha is\\nsuddenly there and helps him back up, guiding him across the rest of the bridge. She comments he cannot hold his\\nwine either. Theon tells her he liked her better as Esgred, and she tells him she liked him better when he was nine.\\nNavigation:\\nTheon I\\n↑\\nJon III\\n ←\\nTheon II\\n→ \\nTyrion VI\\n↓\\nTheon III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 25: Tyrion VI\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion V\\n↑\\nTheon II\\n ←\\nTyrion VI\\n→ \\nArya VI\\n↓\\nTyrion VII\\nTyrion\\n delivers the news to \\nCersei\\n that \\nStannis Baratheon\\n and \\nRenly Baratheon\\n are confronting each other, using the\\nopportunity to poison Cersei so she cannot interfere with his actions. The next day in court he sends \\nCleos Frey\\n back\\nto \\nRobb Stark\\n with the \\nLannister|\\n demands for peace. Finally he hears from \\nAlliser Thorne\\n about the dead coming\\nalive, and dismisses the threat. Later, he takes \\nGrand Maester\\n Pycelle into custody, getting him to confess his role in\\nthe death of \\nJon Arryn\\n, among other crimes.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n passes Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n as he enters \\nCersei\\n’s chambers, where he finds the recently knighted Ser \\nLancel\\nLannister\\n singing to his sister. He complements both, which unnerves Lancel. Tyrion asks Cersei to dismiss Lancel,\\nas there is an important matter for them to discuss. She immediately thinks it is about the begging brothers that were\\nincarcerated after claiming the gods are punishing everyone for \\nJaime\\n killing the rightful king. Cersei complains that\\nSer \\nJacelyn Bywater\\n did nothing so she commanded \\nVylarr\\n to attend to the matter; Tyrion is irritated that Vylarr\\ndragged half a dozen scabrous prophets to the dungeon without consulting him but will not fight over it. After he\\nasks if the bed she sits on is the one where \\nRobert\\n died, which she confirms, saying it gives her sweet dreams, he\\ntells her that \\nStannis Baratheon\\n has sailed from \\nDragonstone\\n, and not to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n, but to \\nStorm\\'s End\\n to \\nlay\\nsiege\\n, and \\nRenly Baratheon\\n is riding to meet him. Tyrion, however, thinks it will end in battle rather than an\\nagreement, since the brothers are too different, yet alike. They laugh heartily and Cersei is so happy she even hugs\\nhim. He fills two cups with wine, adding some powder to hers. As they toast, Tyrion wonders if this is the Cersei\\nJaime sees, and is almost sorry for poisoning her.\\nThe next morning, Cersei is ill, so Tyrion holds audience alone. In the hall, there are both \\nLannister\\n guardsmen and\\nGold Cloaks\\n standing across from each other, with \\nBronn\\n and Ser \\nPreston Greenfield\\n flanking the throne. In\\nattendance are lovely \\nSansa Stark\\n, the coughing Lord \\nGyles Rosby\\n, his cousin \\nTyrek Lannister\\n who recently married\\nyoung \\nErmesande Hayford\\n (he is teased with the nick name “wet nurse”). Ser \\nCleos Frey\\n approaches, and Grand\\nMaester \\nPycelle\\n announces that they cannot accept Robb\\'s terms. Tyrion then gives Ser Cleos their own terms:\\nRobb Stark\\n must lay down his sword, swear fealty, and return to \\nWinterfell\\n. He must free my brother\\nunharmed, and place his host under Jaime’s command, to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis\\nBaratheon. Each of Stark’s bannermen must send us a son as hostage. A daughter will suffice where there is no\\nson. They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court, so long as their fathers commit no new\\ntreasons.\\nWhen Ser Cleos states that Robb will not agree to these terms, Tyrion continues with:\\nTell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock, that soon it will march on him from the west\\nwhile my lord father advances from the east. Tell him that he stands alone, without hope of allies. Stannis and\\nRenly Baratheon war against each other, and the \\nPrince of Dorne\\n has consented to wed his son \\nTrystane\\n to the\\nPrincess \\nMyrcella\\n. As to this of my cousins, we offer \\nHarrion Karstark\\n and Ser \\nWylis Manderly\\n for \\nWillem\\nLannister\\n, and \\nLord Cerwyn\\n and Ser \\nDonnel Locke\\n for your brother \\nTion\\n. Tell Stark that two Lannisters are\\nworth four northmen in any season. His father’s bones he shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey’s good faith.\\n\\nThis raises murmurs of delight and laughter from the audience. Ser Cleos asks about the sword \\nIce\\n and Robb\\'s\\nsisters. Tyrion states that he will have the sword when he makes peace and the sisters when Jaime is released. Tyrion\\nthen tells Vylarr that Ser Cleos is to also have a Lannister escort since he is a cousin, and that Vylarr is to take all of\\nhis guardsmen. This raises concern from Pycelle; Vylarr stands stone still. Tyrion states that the Gold Cloaks and\\nKingsguard\\n are adequate to protect \\nthe king\\n and queen. \\nVarys\\n smiles knowingly, \\nLittlefinger\\n feigns boredom, and\\nPycelle is looking confused.\\nTyrion attempts to close the meeting, but Ser \\nAlliser Thorne\\n speaks up complaining about being ignored. Tyrion\\nfeigns ignorance of him being in the city, blaming Bronn for making his friend that he walked \\nThe Wall\\n with wait.\\nSer Alliser wants to speak to the king, but is told he is playing with his new crossbow (which Tyrion has just given\\nhim), so Ser Alliser will have to talk with the King’s servants.\\nSer Alliser relates how they found the corpses of two long dead rangers, and brought them back to the Wall. They\\nrose that night and killed Ser \\nJaremy Rykker\\n and attempted to murder Ser \\nJeor Mormont\\n. Tyrion gets assurances that\\nthe Lord Commander survived and they killed these two dead men. Ser Alliser tells them that they were dead the\\nfirst time, pale and cold with black hands and feet. As proof he had a hand, but it rotted away while he waited.\\nTyrion thinks of the dread he felt when he was on the Wall with \\nJon Snow\\n. He orders Littlefinger to send Ser Alliser\\nback with 100 spades to bury the dead and prevent them from walking, and also tells Ser Jacelyn that Ser Alliser\\nwill have the pick of the dungeons to use the spades. Tyrion is informed that the dungeons are near empty since\\nYoren\\n has already taken all the likely men. He tells Ser Jacelyn to arrest some more, or to spread the word that there\\nis food at the wall. Ser Alliser is not easily dismissed, trying to warn Tyron of the danger. Ser Preston intervenes,\\nand Ser Alliser knows better than to challenge a Kingsguard. Then, Bronn marches Ser Alliser from the hall.\\nVarys compliments Tyrion on how he handled the situation. Littlefinger asks if he meant to send away all his\\nguards, to which Tyrion responds only his sister’s guards. Tryion notes that Littlefinger is not happy with him, and\\nLittlefinger replies that he loves him as much as ever but that Myrcella Baratheon cannot wed \\nRobert Arryn\\n if she\\nweds Trystane Martell, and to leave him out of the next deception. Glancing at the knife at Littlefinger’s hip, Tyrion\\napologizes, stating the realm needs him.\\nTyrion asks Varys to walk with him. Varys tells him that Cersei will never let him send away her guard, and Tyrion\\nreplies that Varys is going to help him accomplish this by saying it is part of the plan to free Jaime. Varys is to put\\nthe thief, the poisoner, the mummer, and the murderer in crimson cloaks to join the rest of the guard escorting Ser\\nCleos—four among 400 Lannister men cannot be watched closely. She will not like it and be uneasy, but Tyrion\\nlikes her uneasy.\\nSer Cleos leaves that afternoon, escorted by 100 Lannister guardsmen. That same afternoon, Tyrion finds \\nTimett\\ndicing in the barracks and tells him to meet him in his solar at midnight. He feasts with the \\nVale mountain clans\\n that\\nnight, shunning wine for once. During the feast he asks \\nShagga\\n what moon it is and is told black, which they call the\\ntraitor’s moon. He tells Shagga to not get too drunk and to keep his axe sharp.\\nShagga uses his axe to destroy the door to Pycelle’s chambers. Tyrion has Timett pull the naked serving girl out of\\nthe bed and march/drag her into the hall. Tyrion pulls the blanket off the maester, who asks why this is being done to\\na loyal servant. Tyrion tells him that he sent one of his letters to \\nDoran Martell\\n and the other to Cersei. Pycelle tries\\nto blame Varys, but Tyrion informs him that he was the only one he entrusted the information with. Pycelle tries to\\nclaim that something happened to the letter on the way, and that he knows things about Varys that would chill\\nTyrion\\'s blood. Tyrion replies that his lady prefers his blood hot. Then, Pycelle tries to accuse Littlefinger, to which\\nTyrion responds that he already knows about him. Tyrion instructs Shagga to cut off Pycelle\\'s manhood and feed it\\nto the goats. When Shagga states there are no goats, Tyrion tells him to make do. Shagga first takes most of\\nPycelle’s beard with his axe as Pycelle sprays everything with urine. Pycelle tells Tyrion that he did everything for\\nHouse Lannister and to ask \\nTywin\\n; he says he was even responsible for convincing \\nAerys II Targaryen\\n to open the\\ngates. Tyrion, shocked, states “So the Sack of King’s Landing was your work as well?” He then asks him how many\\nhe has betrayed: Aerys, \\nEddard Stark\\n, himself, King \\nRobert\\n, \\nJon Arryn\\n, Prince \\nRhaegar\\n? Pycelle pleads that Robert\\nwas a wretched king, that \\nRenly\\n was plotting to bring \\nMace Tyrell\\n’s \\ndaughter\\n to court and have Cersei supplanted as\\nQueen. Tyrion asks what Lord Arryn had been plotting, and Pycelle explains that Jon Arryn knew of Cersei’s incest.\\nPycelle also knew that Lord Jon planned to send \\nhis wife\\n back to the Eyrie, \\nhis son\\n to foster on \\nDragonstone\\n, and\\nthat he meant to act on his knowledge. Thanks to Shagga’s axe making closer and closer shaves of Pycelle\\'s neck,\\nTyrion finally gets him to confess that he had a hand in the death of \\nJon Arryn\\n by assuring he wouldn\\'t receive\\n\\neffective treatment because he knew about the father of Cersei’s children. He tells them he knew that Cersei wanted\\nJon dead but could not say it since Varys was always listening. He sent \\nColemon\\n away because he was purging Jon.\\nThen Pycelle attempts to blame \\nHugh\\n for the poisoning, telling Tyrion that Varys can tell him. Disgusted, Tyrion\\norders Pycelle thrown into one of the black cells.\\nWhen Pycelle is gone, Tyrion searches the quarters and collects a few more small jars, thinking how he wished\\nPycelle was the one he could have trusted; Varys and Littlefinger are no more loyal, just more subtle and thus more\\ndangerous. Tyrion suspects his father\\'s method might be best; send for \\nIlyn Payne\\n, have all three of their heads\\nmounted above the gates and be done with it.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion V\\n↑\\nTheon II\\n ←\\nTyrion VI\\n→ \\nArya VI\\n↓\\nTyrion VII\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 26: Arya VI\\nPlace(s): \\nThe \\nRiverlands\\n on the way to \\nHarrenhal\\n - \\nHarrenhal\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya V\\n↑\\nTyrion VI\\n ←\\nArya VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys II\\n↓\\nArya VII\\nEight days pass before they leave the village. Each day, one of them is tortured by the \\nTickler\\n for information about\\nwhere valuables and food is hidden (with little result) and the whereabouts of Lord \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n (for no\\ninformation). Finally they are marched to \\nHarrenhal\\n to serve under \\nTywin Lannister\\n. \\nArya\\n, after complaining about\\nbeing assigned to the kitchen, is assigned to the understeward in the \\nWailing Tower\\n, \\nWeese\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nFear has become part of \\nArya\\n\\'s daily life as she walks the hard, rutted roads among a group of prisoners of \\nGregor\\nClegane\\n and his men, a kind of fear she had never known until she was held captive in that storehouse at the shore of\\nthe \\nGods Eye\\n. They spent eight days in the village and are now leaving on Clegane\\'s command, and every day she\\nhas seen someone die.\\nThe Mountain came into the storehouse each morning after breakfast to pick one of them to be interrogated. The\\nvillage folk did not dare to look at him, maybe hoping they would escape his attention. But there was no way to hide\\nfrom him, no way to be safe. He just chose whomever he liked. There was a girl he picked on the fourth day who\\nhad slept with a soldier three nights running, yet the soldier said nothing. There was an old man he picked on the\\nfifth day, who had mended their clothing and declared so often that his son served in the \\nCity Watch\\n and did all for\\nJoffrey\\n that the other prisoners had actually started calling him \\nAll-for-Joffrey\\n. There was a young mother with a\\npox-scarred face who had told Clegane everything she knew on the expectation they would spare her daughter for it,\\nonly to see her daughter be picked the next morning to make certain the mother held nothing back.\\nThe interrogations always went down the same way. They were done in front of the whole group, so that everyone\\nknew what happened to rebels and traitors. They call the ordinarily looking man who did the questioning \\nthe\\nTickler\\n. He was assisted by \\nChiswyck\\n, the old stoop-shouldered man who smashed Arya\\'s head when they caught\\nher, or by someone else, with Clegane just watching and listening until the prisoners died, which they invariably did.\\nThe questions were always about valuables or food hidden in the village, about the whereabouts of \\nBeric Dondarrion\\nand the size of his band and about who of the villagers had assisted them. They found a few valuables from the\\ninterrogations, but only got wildly inconsistent information about Dondarrion and his men. The longest someone\\nsurvived the Tickler\\'s treatment was until evenfall. The bodies were hung by the fires as food for the wolves.\\nThe time in the storehouse has taught Arya that she is no \\nWater Dancer\\n. \\nSyrio Forel\\n would have never let them\\nknock him down, take his sword, just watch as \\nLommy Greenhands\\n was killed, or sit meekly by in that storehouse\\ndoing nothing while others died. She hates the villagers for being sheep almost as much as she hates herself for\\nbeing a lamb, not a direwolf as the sigil of her house suggests. By now the \\nLannisters\\n have taken everything from\\nher: father, friends, home, hope, courage, \\nNeedle\\n. They broke her wooden sword in front of her. They have even\\ntaken away her secret of being a girl. She was still able to pee in privacy at the storehouse, yet on the open road that\\nis not possible, even though she tried to hold it. \\nHot Pie\\n gaped at her when she skinned her breeches at a brush in\\nfront of all, but nobody else even looked. Clegane\\'s men didn\\'t care at all.\\nTheir captors have forbidden them to talk and they punish those who disregard the order, as Arya has learned herself\\nby getting her lip broken. They smashed with a spiked mace the face of a boy who wouldn\\'t stop calling for his\\nfather; then \\nRaff the Sweetling\\n killed the boy\\'s mother as well when she started screaming. Arya sees no purpose\\n\\nany longer in being brave, so she watches people die and does nothing. One woman who was questioned tried to be\\nbrave, but she died screaming just as the rest did. There are no brave ones left on this march, only women and\\nchildren and very old or very young men. The other men were chained to the gibbet and left as food for wolves and\\ncrows. They only spared \\nGendry\\n because he admitted that he had forged his helmet himself, as blacksmiths are too\\nvaluable to be killed.\\nThe Mountain tells them that they will be taken to \\nHarrenhal\\n to serve Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n, a last chance given to\\nrebels and traitors, which they should take: \"Obey, serve, and live.\" Arya hears people arguing about this when they\\ngo to sleep that night. An old woman laments that what is being done to them isn\\'t just, as they didn\\'t commit any\\ntreason. Dondarrion\\'s me just came and taken everything from them, as Clegane\\'s did. Unlike the Mountain\\'s men,\\nDondarrion\\'s did the village folk no harm though, another woman points out, and \\nThoros of Myr\\n even paid for what\\nthey took. Only with signed papers, the old woman replies, and those don\\'t lay eggs as the chicken they took from\\nher used to. Having made sure that no guard is looking, she spits three times for all Lannisters and \\nStarks\\n and \\nTullys\\n.\\nAn old man says that the old king would have never stood for this sin and shame. Arya, forgetting herself, asks\\nwhether he is talking about \\nKing Robert\\n, but the man meant \\nKing Aerys\\n. Then a guard interferes, the old man loses\\nhis two remaining teeth and everyone falls silent.\\nBesides the prisoners, Clegane\\'s band is also taking pigs, chickens, a cow, and nine wagons of salt fish to Harrenhal.\\nThe Mountain and his men are riding horses, but the captives have to walk and are killed if they cannot keep up or\\ntry to flee. The guards pick women at night and go into the bushes with them, receiving almost no resistance. There\\nwas one girl, prettier than the rest, who had to go with four or five different men each night, until she finally hit one\\nwith a stone one day. Clegane himself beheaded her with his massive two-handed greatsword and made everyone\\nwatch. He commanded that the body was to be left for the wolves. Arya has a side-look at Needle, worn at the hip\\nby a black-bearded, balding man called \\nPolliver\\n, thinking how good it is that they took the sword from her, as she\\nwould have used it to stab Glegane that moment – and that would likely have ended with her being left as food for\\nthe wolves as well.\\nPolliver is hardly the worst of the lot, Arya thinks. By now she knows every one of Clegane\\'s men, when they were\\nonly nameless strangers the night she was caught. It\\'s important to keep in mind who of them is lazy or brutal, smart\\nor stupid. The one they call \\nShitmouth\\n has the foulest tongue she ever heard, yet he will give you an extra piece of\\nbread if you ask, while jolly old Chiswyck or soft-spoken Rafford will only hit you. Arya observes them and listens\\nto their talk, polishing her hates the way Gendry used to polish his helmet. She hates \\nDunsen\\n for wearing Gendry\\'s\\nhelmet, Polliver for taking Needle and Chiswyck for thinking he\\'s funny. She hates even more the people she knows\\nare responsible for the death of ones close to her: Raff the Sweetling for the death of \\nLommy\\n, \\nAmory Lorch\\n for the\\ndeath of \\nYoren\\n, \\nMeryn Trant\\n for the death of Syrio, \\nthe Hound\\n for the death of \\nMycah\\n, \\nIlyn Payne\\n and Joffrey and\\nCersei\\n for the death of \\nher father\\n, \\nFat Tom\\n, \\nDesmond\\n and the rest, even for the death of \\nLady\\n, \\nSansa\\'s\\n direwolf. The\\nTickler is almost too scary to hate, though. There are times Arya almost forgets that he is coming along with the\\nband, as he is completely inconspicuous when he isn\\'t torturing people, just another soldier and actually quieter than\\nmost of them. Arya has started whispering to herself the names of the people she hates, she does it every night now.\\nIn \\nWinterfell\\n, she used to pray with her father at the \\ngodswood\\n and with \\nher mother\\n in the \\nsept\\n, but on the road to\\nHarrenhal, whispering those names has become the only prayer left to her.\\nFinally the trees give way to a more open landscape of hills, streams and fields – and the occasional burnt holdfast.\\nAfter another day\\'s march, they get the first glimpse of the towers of Harrenhal rising hard against the blue of the\\nlake. Prisoners keep telling each other that things will get better at Harrenhal, but Arya is not sure about this, as she\\nremembers \\nOld Nan\\'s\\n stories about this castle built on fear and with mortar \\nBlack Harren\\n mixed with human blood,\\nbut where he was roasted with all his sons by the dragons of \\nAegon the Conqueror\\n nonetheless. The castle is only a\\nfew more miles off, Arya thinks, yet they walk almost two more days before they reach Lord Tywin\\'s army,\\nencamped west of the castle in the scorched remains of a town, the stench from the overflowing latrines greeting\\nthem as they approach, telling Arya that the army has been here for some time. The sheer size of Harrenhal makes it\\ndeceptive to the eyes from afar, yet the gatehouse of the castle alone is as large as the Great Keep of Winterfell.\\nArya can only see the tops of the five immense towers from outside. Seeing their grotesque and misshapen form,\\nlooking like an old man\\'s gnarled, knuckly fingers groping for the sky, she now believes every word Old Nan told\\nabout how the stones melted and flowed like candle wax, turning into a searing red as they sought out Harren where\\nhe hid.\\nHot Pie does not want to enter the castle, declaring that there are ghosts within. Chiswyck gives him the choice of\\n\\njoining the ghosts or becoming one, so he walks in with the rest. In the echoing bathhouse, they have to strip and\\nscrub themselves in tubs filled with scolding hot water, the process supervised by two fierce old women who talk\\nabout them like they are newly aquired donkeys. When they examine Arya, Goodwife \\nAmabel\\n is dismayed about\\nher feet while Goodwife \\nHarra\\n has a closer look at the calluses she received while training with Needle. Harra\\nbelieves Arya is a farmer\\'s daughter and got them from churning butter. She tells Arya that she can earn a higher\\nstation in life if she works hard, but will be beaten if she does not. Asked for it, she does not dare to give away her\\ntrue name, nor does she want to use Arry. Thus she says Lommy called her Weasel, the name of the first girl that\\ncomes to her mind. Amabel thinks the name is appropriate. She declares that Arya will lose her hair, as it is filled\\nwith lice, and will be assigned to the kitchen. Arya says she\\'d rather tend the horses, thinking that she could steal one\\nand escape. Harra slaps her so hard that her lip breaks again and commands her to shut up, as nobody is interested in\\nher views. Arya thinks that Harra wouldn\\'t dare slap her if she still had Needle. Amabel explains that Lord Tywin\\nhas grooms and squires to look after the horses and that the kitchen would have been a nice place for Arya, as it is\\nsnug and clean and one can always find a warm place to sleep there. However, Arya doesn\\'t seem to be smart, so\\nthey should give her over to \\nWeese\\n, Amabel suggests. They send her off with a rough-spun garb and ill-fitting\\nshoes.\\nWeese turns out to be the understeward for the \\nWailing Tower\\n, a squat man with a carbuncle on the nose and angry\\nred boils at one corner of his lips. He tells the six assigned to him that the Lannisters are generous to those who\\nserve them well, a fate none of them deserve. If they do well, they might rise one day as high as he did. However, if\\nthey intend to presume on Lord Tywin\\'s kindness, they\\'ll have to deal with Weese. They are told they are not to look\\nthe highborn in the eye, are only allowed to speak when spoken to and should not get in Lord Tywin\\'s way. Weese\\nsays he can smell defiance, pride and disobedience, and if he does, they\\'ll have to answer for it. All he wants to sniff\\nof them is fear.\\nNavigation:\\nArya V\\n↑\\nTyrion VI\\n ←\\nArya VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys II\\n↓\\nArya VII\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 27: Daenerys II\\nPlace(s): \\nQarth\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys I\\n↑\\nArya VI\\n ←\\nDaenerys II\\n→ \\nBran IV\\n↓\\nDaenerys III\\nThere is a great celebration in \\nQarth\\n for the arrival of \\nDaenerys’\\n \\nkhalasar\\n. \\nXaro Xhoan Daxos\\n provides her an entire\\nwing of his palace. After a bath, Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n arrives with a ship captain with news that King \\nRobert\\nBaratheon\\n is dead and there is civil war in the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nThere is a large celebration for their arrival at \\nQarth\\n apparent as \\nDaenerys’\\n \\nkhalasar\\n approaches the city and a\\ncolumn of camelry rides from the city to provide her an honor guard. The warlock \\nPyat Pree\\n told Daenerys that\\nQarth is the greatest city, a crossroads, and ancient. Upon seeing the city, Daenerys has to admit the city is\\nmagnificent. It has three thick walls: the first is 30 feet high and made of red sandstone carved with animals, the\\nsecond 40 feet high and made of granite carved with scenes of war, and the third 50 feet high, made of black marble\\ncarved with scenes of sex. \\nQartheen\\n line the streets and balconies to watch them pass, black \\nDrogon\\n on her shoulder.\\nThe women are in gowns that bare one breast, and the men wear beaded silk shirts while the children wear only\\nsandals and paint. Daenerys thinks how the \\nDothraki\\n call these people “Milk Men\" for their skin and how \\nKhal\\nDrogo\\n dreamed sacking the great city.\\nThe merchant prince \\nXaro Xhoan Daxos\\n rides up on his camel, which the Dothraki horses shy away from. He tells\\nDaenerys that if she desires anything she sees it is hers. Pyat Pree sings from her other side “Qarth itself is hers, she\\nhas no need of baubles,” and she should come to the \\nHouse of the Undying\\n to drink wisdom and truth. Daenerys\\ntells them both that she only wants the \\nRed Keep\\n in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n and if they want to give her gifts, to give her\\nships and swords. Pyat states that it will be as she commands and the other complements her on her wisdom. Xaro\\nXhoan Daxos warns her that warlocks are not to be trusted. The two continue to bicker until Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\nmutters in the common tongue “The crow calls the raven black,” that she should avoid both men, and that it would\\nbe best to not linger here. Daenerys, however, wants their help in winning her throne.\\nDaenerys expected something grand when Xaro Xhoan Daxos offered the hospitality of his home, but not a palace\\nlarger than a market town, with an entire wing given over to her. He tells her that there will be a feast the next day\\nwith delicacies and music, and the \\nThirteen\\n will come to do her honor. Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Pyat depart. The last\\nof the three seekers, the shadowbinder \\nQuaithe\\n gives Daenerys a warning to beware of everyone, for they all lust for\\nthe power of her dragons, and then departs.\\nAfter Quaithe leaves, Ser Jorah states she is right, but he also does not trust her. Daenerys admits that she does not\\nunderstand Quaithe. While the others shower her in promises, she has only cryptic words. It also concerns her that\\nshe has not seen her face. Then Daenerys declares that they will keep their own watch, and will keep a sharp eye on\\nthe dragons. After \\nAggo\\n confirms it will be done, she tells \\nRakharo\\n to use good men and women to explore the rest\\nof Qarth since they have only seen the parts that the seekers wanted them to see. She then asks Ser Jorah to go to the\\ndocks to get news of the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n, and maybe find a ship to carry them home. Ser Jorah tells her the usurper\\nwill kill her and wants to stay with her but she tells him that \\nJhogo\\n can guard her, and he has the languages and more\\nexperience with the sea.\\nAfter they leave, her handmaidens strip her of her travel stained silks and she bathes in a marble pool with golden\\nfish. She wonders if the Red Keep has a pool like this with fragrant gardens, remembering \\nViserys\\n saying that the\\n\\nSeven Kingdoms are the most beautiful place in the world. She also thinks she no longer has Drogo’s khalasar\\nbehind her, only her four fierce \\nbloodriders\\n, and that the Dothraki plundered but do not know how to govern. She\\nponders Ser Jorah’s words: \"The Usurper will kill you.\" She then thinks about \\nRobert Baratheon\\n, strong as a bull,\\nfearless in battle and loving war, who killed her brother \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n, and his dogs: \\nEddard Stark\\n, \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n and \\nJaime Lannister\\n. How will she overthrow them? Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys, who\\nwas a fool, believed the realm would rise for their rightful king. She then decides that the \\nBleeding Star\\n has led her\\nto Qarth for a purpose, and if the gods intend for her to conquer they will send a sign.\\nNear eveningfall, \\nIrri\\n brings word that Ser Jorah has returned. He enters with \\nQuhuru Mo\\n, captain of the \\nCinnamon\\nWind\\n out of \\nTall Trees Town\\n. Daenerys has her dragons all around her. He has the news that Robert Baratheon is\\ndead, reported in \\nOldtown\\n, \\nDorne\\n and \\nLys\\n. There are tales that \\nthe queen\\n, his brother (\\nStannis Baratheon\\n or \\nRenly\\nBaratheon\\n, or \\nEddard Stark\\n betrayed him. \\nJoffrey Baratheon\\n sits on the throne with \\nHouse Lannister\\n ruling, Robert’s\\nbrothers have fled, and the \\nHand of the King\\n has been seized for treason. Jorah does not think it likely that Eddard is\\na traitor, saying the long summer will come again before he besmirches his honor. Daenerys wonders if her brother\\nwould have been wiser had he known that vengeance was so close at hand. When asked, the captain replies he is not\\nreturning to \\nWesteros\\n for a year or more since his ship will sail east from Qarth, making the trader’s circle around\\nthe \\nJade Sea\\n. When Daenerys states he has brought her a precious gift, he tells her that he has been amply repaid by\\nbeing allowed to see dragons. She aks him to come to her one day in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n.\\nAfter the trader leaves, Ser Jorah warns Daenerys of speaking so freely. Daenerys replies that the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\nare flying to pieces like the khalasar did after Khal Drogo died. Ser Jorah tells her that she will still need gold,\\narmies, and ships. Daenerys responds that she knows this, but she is the blood of the dragon. Jorah goes on to say\\nthat King Robert killed a dragon with a warhammer. To this she replies that dragons die, but so do dragon slayers.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys I\\n↑\\nArya VI\\n ←\\nDaenerys II\\n→ \\nBran IV\\n↓\\nDaenerys III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 28: Bran IV\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran III\\n↑\\nDaenerys II\\n ←\\nBran IV\\n→ \\nTyrion VII\\n↓\\nBran V\\nBran\\n is with \\nMeera\\n and \\nJojen\\n in the \\ngodswood\\n of \\nWinterfell\\n. Meera tells Bran that Jojen has the \\ngreensight\\n and has\\ndreams that sometimes come true. Jojen reveals that he has dreamed of the Winged Wolf chained to earth and a\\nthree-eyed crow\\n has been unable to free him from the chains. Finally, Bran tells them something of his dreams, and\\nJojen keeps pressing. \\nSummer\\n gets aggressive and attacks as Bran gets angry, but the Reeds manage to climb a tree\\nto avoid the wolf. Afterwards Bran asks Maester \\nLuwin\\n about Jojen’s greensight, and is told no man has the\\ngreensight.\\nSynopsis\\nMeera\\n, armed with a three pronged frog spear and a net, is facing \\nSummer\\n in the \\ngodswood\\n. Summer charges past\\nthe spear, but is entangled in the net as he slams into her. \\nBran\\n tells her that she loses, but \\nJojen\\n, whom Old \\nNan\\ncalls “little grandfather” because he is so somber, points out that Summer is entangled in the net. After disentangling\\nthe wolf, and Bran calling to him, she asks if Summer ever grows angry. Bran tells her not with him, and he has\\nnever drawn blood. Meera is still worried, but Bran assures her that he would not have drawn her blood; he knows\\nand likes her. Bran thinks about how Meera is so like his sister \\nArya\\n, and tells them that he wishes they were their\\nwards instead of \\nBig Walder\\n and \\nLittle Walder\\n. They have stayed after all the others have gone, and have become\\nhis constant companions. Bran tells Meera he has never heard of anyone fighting with a net, and asks if their master-\\nat-arms taught her. She tells him her father taught her, and they have no knights or ravens at \\nGreywater Watch\\n; the\\nisland moves so neither ravens nor enemies can find it. When Bran asks if he would be welcome at Greywater\\nWatch after the hostilities end, they assure him that \\ntheir lord father\\n would welcome him anytime, and that leaving\\nWinterfell\\n sooner rather than later would be good for him.\\nIt is revealed that the \\nBastard of Bolton\\n has forcibly taken Lady \\nHornwood\\n as his wife after the \\nharvest feast\\n, that\\nLord \\nManderly\\n took her castle to protect it, and Ser \\nRodrik\\n has gone east to settle the uprising and see that justice is\\ndone. Bran could ask Ser Rodrik about visiting the Reeds when he returns.\\nMeera reveals that Jojen has the \\ngreensight\\n; he has dreams of things that have not happened but sometimes do; Jojen\\ncorrects this by saying they always do. Bran asks to hear about the dreams, and is told that Jojen will, but only if\\nBran tells them about his own dreams. Bran denies he has dreams, saying that Maester \\nLuwin\\n gives him sleeping\\ndraughts, which he admits help only sometimes. Meera tells him that everyone in the Castle hears him scream when\\nhe sleeps. Bran does not tell, but is interested in what dreams Jojen has had. Jojen thinks that Bran is \\nthe Winged\\nWolf\\n bound to earth by chains. He also states that a crow is trying to peck through the chains, but his beak can only\\nchip them. When asked if the crow has 3 eyes, Jojen nods.\\nThe crow first came to Jojen when he almost died of greywater fever, and to Bran after he fell. It told him he had to\\nfly, but when Bran woke, he was broken and couldn’t fly. After hearing this, Jojen is sure that Bran is the Winged\\nWolf, and they tell Bran that the \\nthree-eyed crow\\n is not in Greywater Watch, but north, \\nbeyond the Wall\\n. When their\\nfather heard Jojen’s dream, he sent them to Winterfell. When Bran asks how he will break the chains he is told to\\nopen his eye, not the two that are opened, but the third one; when he opens his third eye he will be able to see south\\nto the \\nSummer Sea\\n and north beyond the Wall.\\nBran decides that he is tired of talking of crows, and wants to talk about something else, and then asks about \\nlizard-\\n\\nlions\\n. However, Jojen keeps asking Bran about his dream, whether he has dreamed he was Summer, and then reveals\\nthat when he touched Summer the night of the harvest feast he felt Bran in Summer, and that he felt Bran fall. He\\nthen asks if falling scares Bran; Bran thinks of \\nthe golden man\\n, and that he scares him. He has not been able to tell\\nSer Rodrik or Maester Luwin, so cannot tell the Reeds either. Jojen continues by asking if he falls every night, and\\nthere is a low rumbling growl from Summer. Meera puts herself between Summer and her brother and asks Bran to\\nkeep the wolf back. Bran claims that Jojen is making Summer angry, but Meera responds that it is him that Jojen is\\nmaking angry, his fear. She tells Bran that he and Summer are part of each other. \\nShaggydog\\n arrives. The direwolf\\nlunges and Meera tells Bran to call them off, but he does not know how, and Jojen tells Bran that Summer is\\nreacting to his anger. Meera tells her brother to climb the tree. Jojen responds that it is not his day to die, but\\ncomplies, and Meera follows.\\nBran has been unable to call off the wolves, but remembers he is not alone and calls to \\nHodor\\n. When Hodor appears,\\nBran tells him to chase the wolves away, which he gleefully does. When Jojen returns to the ground he never takes\\nhis eyes off Summer as he tells Bran that they will talk again. Bran only thinks that it was the wolves, not him, and\\ntells Hodor to bring him to Maester Luwin.\\nWhen he is with Maester Luwin, he tells him that Meera said her brother has the Greensight. Luwin explains that\\ntheir wise men call such people greenseers. He then tells Bran that nobody truly knows what it is, but that the \\nFirst\\nMen\\n thought the greenseers could see through the eyes of the \\nweirwood\\n, which is why the men cut down the trees,\\nand that they have control over animals and fish. When asked, Bran tells the maester that Jojen only claims to have\\ndreams that sometimes come true. The maester tells Bran that everyone has dreams that come true, like when he and\\nRickon dreamed their \\nfather\\n was in the crypts before they knew he was dead. He then asks Bran whether he\\nremembers the meaning of the metals of a maester’s chain: black iron for ravenry, silver—healing, gold—sums.\\nLuwin pulls his chain around his neck to reveal a link made of \\nValyrian steel\\n and tells Bran that it signifies the study\\nof the higher mysteries, magic; this is a study of small use that few maesters trouble with. He goes on to say that\\nmagic may have once been a mighty force but no longer: \\nValyria\\n was its last ember, and dragons, the children, and\\ngiants are no more. Jojen does not have the greensight since no living man has that power.\\nBran tells Meera what the maester said when she comes to him at dusk, and that Summer should not have tried to\\nhurt Jojen, but Jojen should not have made the comments about his dreams; the crow lied, and so did Jojen that Bran\\ncould fly. Meera suggests that the maester may be wrong, but Bran replies that he is not and that his father depended\\non him. She leaves him with another of Jojen’s dreams, that one day soon Maester Luwin will serve him a king’s cut\\noff the roast at a great feast, but the portion he gives to the Walders will be grey and dead, yet they will like their\\nmeal better than he.\\nThat night Bran is almost afraid to sit at supper, but everyone is served the same, and there is nothing wrong with\\nthe food served the Walders. Bran is relieved: nothing bad is coming to Winterfell, but he is disappointed also—so\\nlong as there is magic anything can happen. He will never walk, fly or be a knight.\\nNavigation:\\nBran III\\n↑\\nDaenerys II\\n ←\\nBran IV\\n→ \\nTyrion VII\\n↓\\nBran V\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 29: Tyrion VII\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VI\\n↑\\nBran IV\\n ←\\nTyrion VII\\n→ \\nArya VII\\n↓\\nTyrion VIII\\nIt is late at night when \\nTyrion\\n is disturbed by the arrival of \\nLancel\\n with demands from \\nCersei\\n that \\nPycelle\\n be\\nreleased and Ser \\nJacelyn Bywater\\n be arrested for defying a command in the \\nking\\'s\\n name. Lancel is arrogant until\\nTyrion reveals he knows his part in King \\nRobert\\'s\\n death and that Lancel has been having sex with the queen. Tyrion\\nthreatens to tell Joffrey, and this convinces Lancel to agree to be Tyrion\\'s spy. Afterwards, Tyrion travels a\\ncircuitous route to be with \\nShae\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n is informed by a sleepy \\nPodrick Payne\\n that \\nLancel Lannister\\n has arrived. Tyrion is not bothered by the late\\nhour since he usually works well into the morning reading \\nVarys\\n\\' whisperers\\' reports or going over \\nLittlefinger\\'s\\naccounts. He figures, however, that \\nCersei\\n was expecting Lancel\\'s late arrival would catch him less alert. Tyrion\\ntakes his time, and roughens his hair to make it look like he has been woken from his sleep.\\nTyrion warmly greets Lancel, who has been pacing. Lancel tells him that Cersei commands that \\nPycelle\\n be released,\\nhanding Tyrion her warrant. Tyrion tells Lancel he hopes she is not overtaxing herself, he would not want to see a\\nrelapse. After being assured that she is recovered, Tyrion states it is music to his ears, thinking he should have given\\nher a larger dose. Tryion offers Lancel mulled wine to help him sleep, and he rejects the offer, having not come to\\ndrink. Tyrion states that wine has its dangers and that he would have thought if Cersei was so concerned about\\nPycelle she would have come herself. Lancel tells Tyrion just to release the prisoner with a sneer, that the queen is\\nJoffrey\\'s\\n regent. Tyrion replies that he is Joffrey\\'s \\nHand\\n. Lancel replies “The Hand serves. The regent rules until the\\nking is of age,” and Tyrion says maybe he should write it down so he can remember, and tells Podrick to leave.\\nAfter Pod leaves, Lancel states that Ser \\nJacelyn Bywater\\n defied a command in the king\\'s name, and that Cersei\\ndemands he be removed and charged with treason; Tyrion thinks that it means that Cersei has already ordered\\nPycelle\\'s release and Bywater rebuffed her. When Lancel threatens Tyrion, Tyrion responds that he will hear no\\nwarning from a boy. Lancel touches his sword and warns Tysrion to watch his words. Tyrion in turn warns him that\\nat a cry from him, \\nShagga\\n will break in and kill Lancel with an axe and not a wineskin. Lancel, incensed, tells\\nTyrion that he is a knight. Tyrion asks if Cersei had him knighted before or after she took him to bed. Lancel says\\nnothing, and Tyrion can tell from his eyes that Varys was right. When Tyrion comments, Lancel demands Tyrion\\nwithdraw his filthy accusations. Before he can finish, Tyrion mentions the result if Joffrey discovers he murdered his\\nfather to bed his mother. Lancel\\'s courage deserts him as he insists to Tyrion that \\nTywin Lannister\\n commanded\\nLancel to do everything that Cersei told him when he was assigned squire to King \\nRobert I Baratheon\\n. Tryion asks if\\nTywin told him to fuck Cersei also, noting that Lancel looks somewhat like \\nJaime\\n, but a poor copy. Lancel starts to\\nsay he only did has he was bid, to which Tyrion adds that he must have hated every instant of a high place in court,\\nknighthood, and Cersei opening her legs, and then threatens to go to the king. Lancel begs for mercy as Tyrion\\ncontinues his threats to go to the king, whom he is duty bound to inform. When Lancel states he will end it, Tyrion\\ntells him no, that he will stay close to Cersei, be a spy for him, and tell no one. Lancel agrees, and Tyrion orders him\\nto drink to their understanding. Tyrion then tells Lancel that he could do well out of this and that knighthood is\\nnothing. Then he orders him to tell the queen that he begs her forgiveness, and he will let her have Pycelle to do with\\nhowever she will, but he will not be on the council. With respect to Ser Jacelyn Bywater, Lancel is to assure the\\nqueen that he thinks he can win him away from Tyrion. Tyrion also notes he does not want another nephew. Lancel\\ntells him that there is no need for concern since Cersei has him spill his seed on her belly.\\n\\nAfter he leaves, Tyrion thinks it fortunate that Lancel\\'s father \\nKevan Lannister\\n has two other sons, since in Tyrion\\'s\\nview, as Cersei will kill Lancel if she finds out he is betraying her, and even if Lancel survives the war, he will never\\nsurvive Jaime\\'s return to King\\'s Landing, the only question being whether Jaime kills Lancel in a jealous rage or\\nCersei kills him to stop Jaime from finding out. Tyrion privately bets on Cersei.\\nTyrion cannot get to sleep, so he sends Podrick, who was asleep, to summon \\nBronn\\n and get two horses saddled.\\nWhen Bronn arrives, he asks “Who pissed in your soup?” to which Tyrion answers Cersei. He states he should be\\nused to the taste and that she seems to have mistaken him for \\nEddard Stark\\n. Bronn replies that he was tall, to which\\nTyrion responds not after Joffrey took off his head.\\nThey leave through the postern gate, then down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of \\nAegon\\'s high hill\\n onto Pigrun\\nAlley. Tyrion reflects that the men that have been Hand have been no match for Cersei because they were too\\nhonest. The only way to defeat Cersei is to play her own game. In the crowded brothel, they are met by \\nChataya\\n,\\nwho leads them to the common room and serves them wine, apologizing for the quality; she cannot find good wine\\nat any price, which Tyrion understands. As Tyrion waits, \\nDancy\\n slides onto his lap, saying she has a cure for him\\nfeeling unloved. He tells her that he has grown fond of \\nAlayaya\\n\\'s remedy. When Alayaya arrives, she leads him up\\nthe stairs, and tells him that Dancy has a bet with \\nMarei\\n, and has only a fortnight before she loses her black pearls.\\nShe leads him to the Tower Room, telling him that she will sleep while he is gone before he disappears down the\\nshaft to the tunnel.\\nAs he leaves the stables on his gelding, he hears music that reminds him of the words \\nTysha\\n sung to him, who was a\\nlie, a whore Jaime had hired to make him a man.\\nHe arrives at the manse which has been arranged by Varys as a place to sequester \\nShae\\n. He told Varys he wanted her\\nprotected by ugly, scary men who did not like having sex with women. She is now protected by a \\nBraavosi\\ndaggerman\\n with a hare lip and a lazy eye, one \\neunuch strangler\\n, and a pair of foul smelling \\nIbbenese\\n who are fond of\\naxes and each other. If Tyrion had her guarded by his \\nclansmen\\n, it would only be a matter of time before everyone\\nknew of his concubine.\\nHe enters the room not intending to disturb Shae, but the sight of her nude body makes him hard. He spreads her\\nlegs and starts to lick her until his beard is soaked and then enters her, and explodes almost at once. She opens her\\neyes and tells him she just had the sweetest dream.\\nTyrion thinks of the wars and intrigues and that he was made for this.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VI\\n↑\\nBran IV\\n ←\\nTyrion VII\\n→ \\nArya VII\\n↓\\nTyrion VIII\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 30: Arya VII\\nPlace(s): \\nHarrenhal\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya VI\\n↑\\nTyrion VII\\n ←\\nArya VII\\n→ \\nCatelyn III\\n↓\\nArya VIII\\nArya\\n is working for the understeward of the \\nWailing Tower\\n doing various chores. When the Ser \\nAmory Lorch\\narrives, \\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\n, \\nRorge\\n and \\nBiter\\n are with him. Arya thinks that Jaqen has not seen her, but he interrupts her\\nsleep that night to tell her he will kill three men for her for saving him and his two companions. She avoids Jaqen for\\na while, but after hearing a story by \\nChiswyck\\n, she whispers Chiswyck’s name in Jaqen\\'s ear. Several days later he\\nfalls to his death.\\nSynopsis\\nArya\\n wonders what King \\nHarren Hoare\\n meant to name the five towers of \\nHarrenhal\\n, but they are now known as the\\nTower of Dread\\n, the \\nWidow\\'s Tower\\n, the \\nWailing Tower\\n, the \\nTower of Ghosts\\n, and \\nKingspyre Tower\\n since the\\nburning of Harrenhal\\n. She now sleeps in a niche in the vaults beneath the Wailing Tower. The work is hard, but no\\nharder than the miles she was walking every day, and she can wash and the food is filling; she does not need to find\\nbugs to eat. \\nHot Pie\\n is assigned to the kitchens, and \\nGendry\\n to the forge, while Arya works for the understeward\\nWeese\\n doing errands; running messages, drawing water, fetching food, and sometimes serving tables in the barracks\\nhall. Arya hates \\nWeese\\n and adds him to her list of names. She occasionally gets to see Hot Pie when she is sent to\\nfetch the food for Weese and his charges; Arya does not want to learn the names of Weese’s other charges since it\\nhurts when people she knows die.\\nLady \\nShella Whent\\n only occupied parts of two towers, letting the rest of the castle go to ruin. She left a small staff\\nwhen she fled, inadequate for the host that now occupies the castle. As a result, the \\nLannisters\\n have to forage for\\nservants to make more of Harrenhal habitable. Harrenhal covers three times the area of \\nWinterfell\\n, but its buildings\\nare much grander: the stables handle 1000 horses, the \\nGodswood\\n covers 20 acres, the kitchen is as large as\\nWinterfell’s Great Hall, and the Hall of the Hundred Hearths could handle Tywin’s entire host.\\nSome claim the ghosts of \\nHarren the Black\\n and his sons occupy the Wailing Tower, but Arya knows that they died\\nin the Kingspyre Tower; the wailing is from the wind, and the ghosts never trouble her. However she fears living\\nmen, including Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n and \\nTywin Lannister\\n, who keep their apartments in the Kingspyre Tower. She\\nconsiders marching up to Tywin and telling him who she is, but figures she would never get close enough to him,\\nand if she did, he would not believe her, and she would get a beating form Weese, whom she fears more than the\\nMountain; he hits at the slightest provocation. On the road to Harrenhal, she felt like a sheep, but now she feels like\\na mouse.\\nThe lords and ladies never notice the grey mice under their feet, and Arya hears many secrets by just listening as she\\ndoes her duties. The \\'slut\\' Pretty \\nPia\\n is working her way through every knight, the wife of the gaoler is pregnant\\neither by Ser \\nAlyn Stackspear\\n or a singer \\nWhitesmile\\n, Lord \\nLeo Lefford\\n keeps a candle lit by his bed because of the\\nghosts, Ser \\nDunaver\\n’s squire \\nJodge\\n cannot hold his water at night, the cooks spit on the despised Ser \\nHarys Swyft\\n’s\\nfood, and Maester \\nTothmure\\n’s serving girl told her brother that Tywin has ordered the maester to burn a message\\nclaiming that Joffrey is a bastard, and to never speak of it again. She also hears from Weese that \\nStannis Baratheon\\nand \\nRenly Baratheon\\n are both kings and have joined the fighting. Many of the Lannister men question how long\\nJoffrey can hold the throne, protected only by \\nGold Cloaks\\n and ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf and a woman. There have\\nalso been a number of reports of \\nBeric Dondarrion\\n being killed by the \\nBloody Mummers\\n, but he has already\\nsupposedly been killed by \\nAmory Lorch\\n at \\nRushing Falls\\n, and twice by the Mountain.\\n\\nA fortnight later, the queerest collection of men Arya has ever seen arrives, the Bloody Mummers. Weese assures\\nher that she does not want to know them, and is told they are called The Footmen, Toes of the Goat, and Lord\\nTywin’s Bloody Mummers. They call themselves the Brave Companions and their leader is the very tall, stick thin\\nVargo Hoat\\n. They are housed in the Widow’s Tower, for which Arya is thankful. On their first night, Ser \\nHarys\\nSwyft\\n’s squire is killed and two of the Bloody Mummers are wounded. Tywin hangs both along with one of Lord\\nLewys Lydden\\n’s archers who is supposed to have started the trouble. They do not stay long, but before they leave\\nshe hears that \\nRoose Bolton\\n has occupied the \\nRuby Ford\\n and her brother is in \\nRiverrun\\n, which is much closer than\\nWinterfell but she does not know where it lies in relation to Harrenhal; if only she could get away.\\nShe learns that there are captives from the \\nBattle of the Green Fork\\n. They have been given freedom of the castle in\\nreturn for a pledge that they will not attempt to escape, but Arya is hoping they can help her escape. There are three\\nFrey brothers and their bastard brother, but they are soon ransomed. There is also a very fat lordling who is always\\nin the kitchen, one that wears a black cloak with white suns, and Lord \\nMedger Cerwyn\\n, whom she recognizes. She\\nfigures she can get aid from Lord Cerwyn, but learns later that he died from his wounds.\\nArya hears all sorts of rumors about Lord Tywin’s plans. Lord Tywin spends his days with his war council. Arya\\noften catches sight of him, and thinks he is strong looking for an old man, and his face reminds her of her father,\\nalthough they look nothing alike, and she could never picture Tywin laughing.\\nSer \\nAmory Lorch\\n arrives one afternoon, looking less frightening in the daylight. He has fewer men than she\\nremembers and many wounded. She is told that they rode all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and\\nslaying rebels. Arya figures they are talking about the men of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n. At the end of the column she sees\\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\n, \\nRorge\\n and \\nBiter\\n with his body covered in half-healed wounds. Jaqen H’ghar still smiles, and his\\nclothes are filthy, but his hair washed and brushed. His eyes pass right over Arya, and she thinks he did not even\\nnotice her. Arya thinks that Gendry was right and she should have let them die. That night, she says the names\\nagain: \\nWeese\\n, \\nDunsen\\n, \\nChiswyck\\n, \\nPolliver\\n, \\nRaff\\n the Sweetling, the \\nTickler\\n, \\nthe Hound\\n, Ser \\nGregor\\n, Ser \\nAmory\\nLorch\\n, Ser \\nIlyn\\n, Ser \\nMeryn\\n, and King \\nJoffrey\\n and \\nQueen Cersei\\n. She thinks she might add three names to the list,\\nbut she is too tired to decide.\\nShe is dreaming of wolves in the wild when she wakes with Jaqen H’ghar’s hand over her mouth. He notes that the\\nboy Arry became a girl and revealing that he did see her that afternoon. He then explains that she saved three lives,\\nthus he has to repay her by taking three lives of her choice, in order to appease the \\nRed God\\n. When Arya asks him to\\ntake her to Riverrun, he replies that he will take three lives for her, nothing more, and gives her some time to decide\\nwhom to kill. Then, he leaves before she can even light her candle.\\nThe next morning, Arya yawns in Weese’s presence, and he warns her not to let her mouth drop open again, telling\\nher he will feed her tongue to his bitch, and twists her ear to make certain she heard. As she works, she thinks of\\nwhom she wants dead, and that, being at war, she should try to kill as many Lannisters as she could, but her father\\npersonally killed those he condemned to death. She is not sure she should trust Jaqen, and avoids him for a while,\\nwhich is not hard to do.\\nSer Gregor returns, and Weese sends Arya to see if they have clothes that need mending. She arrives to find\\nChiswyck talking, and does not want to interrupt because she might be hit. He is talking about when he was\\nreturning from the \\nTourney of the Hand\\n with Ser Gregor, Raff, \\nJoss Stilwood\\n, and \\nEggon\\n. They stopped at an\\nalehouse where the brewer did not stop talking. They knew better than to talk because the Mountain was seething\\nover the joust with the \\nKnight of Flowers\\n. The brewer’s girl was serving, and they were touching her. Finally, Joss\\nput his hand up her skirt, and she screamed, running to the kitchen. The brewer went to Ser Gregor and asked that\\nhis men leave the girl alone. Ser Gregor had the girl brought before him, payed the brewer a silver, and raped her\\nright there.Her brother ran in from the cellar and Raff stabbed him with a dirk. After Ser Gregor was done, \\nTobbot\\nand Chiswyck continued to rape her. Ser Gregor told the brewer the girl was not worth a silver, and demanded\\nchange, and the brewer gave it to him. They all roar with laughter at the story while Arya sneaks away. When Weese\\nlearns she did not ask about the mending, he beats her bloody.\\nTwo days later she sees Jaqen H’ghar in the Barracks Hall. Ensuring that Weese is not around, she works her way\\ndown to him filling wine cups until she reaches him and whispers “Chiswyck” in his ear. He gives no sign that he\\nheard, and nothing happens until the third day, when she hears that a man fell off the wallwalk the previous night.\\nSome are saying Harren’s ghost flung him down and Arya thinks that she is the ghost in Harrenhal and there is one\\n\\nless name on her list.\\nNavigation:\\nArya VI\\n↑\\nTyrion VII\\n ←\\nArya VII\\n→ \\nCatelyn III\\n↓\\nArya VIII\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 31: Catelyn III\\nPlace(s): \\nOutside the walls of \\nStorm\\'s End\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn II\\n↑\\nArya VII\\n ←\\nCatelyn III\\n→ \\nSansa III\\n↓\\nCatelyn IV\\nCatelyn\\n meets with \\nStannis Baratheon\\n and \\nRenly Baratheon\\n in hopes of bringing the brothers to reason. She fails\\nand learns that Stannis has sent a letter claiming that neither \\nJoffery\\n nor \\nTommen\\n are \\nRobert Baratheon\\n’s sons. Even\\nthough there is no proof, she remembers that \\nLysa\\n claimed that \\nCersei\\n killed her husband. Catelyn asks Renly’s\\nleave but is not given it—he wants her to see him victorious in the morning.\\nSynopsis\\nHallis Mollen\\n announces to \\nCatelyn\\n that they are the first to arrive at an area where the trees have been cut down by\\nStannis Baratheon\\n’s foragers to build siege equipment. Ser \\nWendel Manderly\\n tells Catelyn that this is not their fight\\nand Catelyn replies that she was sent here by \\nRobb Stark\\n and for the good of the realm it must be done, but forging a\\npeace between the brothers will not be easy; she would prefer to be with her dying father \\nHoster Tully\\n in \\nRiverrun\\n or\\nback in \\nWinterfell\\n. In the distance she can see \\nStorm\\'s End\\n and Stannis’ army looking small and insignificant under\\nits walls.\\nCatelyn thinks about the history of Storm’s End and of the love between the first Storm King, \\nDurran\\n, and \\nElenei\\n,\\nthe daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. After the wedding, Elenei yielded her maidenhood and\\nimmortality. Her parents unleashed storm and wind to destroy Durran’s hold, killing all but Durran and his wife,\\nwho had protected him within her arms. It was the seventh castle he built that managed to withstand the storms. It is\\nsaid that this castle was built with the help of the \\nchildren of the forest\\n or a child that became known as \\nBrandon the\\nBuilder\\n.\\nStannis is the first to arrive with a \\nRed Priestess\\n as his standard bearer; Catelyn knows that \\nRenly\\n will be last.\\nStannis expresses his surprise to find her here, and gives his condolences for her husband \\nEddard Stark\\n, though he\\nnotes Stark was no friend of his. Stannis is not grateful for Eddard’s part in breaking the siege, saying it was on\\nRobert Baratheon\\n’s command. He holds it against Eddard that he took the position of \\nHand of the King\\n, which he\\ndid not even want. Stannis tells her that regardless of his feelings for her husband, Catelyn will have justice for his\\nmurder; she responds that Renly promised the same, but she would prefer her daughters back. Stannis promises that\\nher daughters will be found when he takes King\\'s Landing. Catelyn thinks his tone implies dead or alive, and tells\\nhim that King’s Landing is closer to \\nDragonstone\\n, but he is at Storm’s End. He replies that he needs the power of the\\nsouthron lords to take King’s Landing, and so he must take them from his brother, who owes him loyalty and\\nobedience as his elder and rightful king. Stannis then asks if Robb has thrown his lot in with Renly, and is told he is\\nKing of the North by the will of the lords and people, and only holds his hand out in friendship. Stannis replies that\\nkings have no friends, only subjects and enemies.\\nAt this point, Renly’s party arrives with \\nBrienne of Tarth\\n bearing the banner. Renly asks about Stannis\\' sigil and the\\npriestess replies it is the fiery heart of the \\nLord of Light\\n. Renly says it is just as well since, if they had the same\\nbanner, the battle would be confused. Catelyn expresses hope that there will be no battle, and Stannis states that the\\nIron Throne\\n is his by rights, and those who deny this are his foes. Catelyn tells them that this is folly with the\\nKingslayer\\n’s host reforming at the \\nGolden Tooth\\n, another \\nLannister\\n host gathering at \\nCasterly Rock\\n, and \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n at \\nHarrenhal\\n with 20,000 men, and the Lannisters holding \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n. Renly immediately demands\\nthat Stannis bend his knee to him, and Stannis absolutely refuses, stating he is eldest and denouncing Renly as a\\nusurper. Renly responds that the \\nTargaryens\\n called Robert a usurper and he bore up under the shame. Catelyn tries to\\n\\nconvince them to be reasonable, only to be rebuked by Stannis, who asserts that he is the rightful king; Stannis also\\nadds that he considers her son no less a traitor than Renly, and promises to deal with Robb in due time. Catelyn asks\\nhow he is the rightful king, given that Robert had two sons, at which Renly laughs, stating that she has not seen\\nStannis’ letter. Stannis tells Catelyn that \\nJoffrey\\n and his siblings are not of Robert’s seed, but bastards born of incest\\nbetween Cersei and her brother.\\nCatelyn asks why Stannis kept this knowledge to himself, and is told that he approached \\nJon Arryn\\n since he figured\\nthat Robert would be more willing to listen to Jon, whom he loved, as opposed to Stannis, from whom such\\naccusations would have seemed self serving. Renly points out that Jon is dead, and Stannis states that his death was\\nnot by happenstance, that \\nCersei\\n poisoned him. Catelyn, immediately putting the pieces together, adds that her sister\\nLysa\\n accused the queen of killing her husband. Renly tells Stannis that he may have the greater right, but Renly has\\nthe bigger army.\\nRenly reaches under his cloak, and Stannis immediately goes for his sword, but Renly only brings out a peach,\\noffering it to Stannis. Stannis retorts he did not come there to eat fruit, and Renly replies a man should never refuse a\\npeach because life is short and as the \\nStarks\\n say, “Winter is Coming.” Stannis thinks this is a threat but Renly states\\nit was not, and he tells Stannis he never liked him, but he is of his blood, and if it is Storm’s End he wants, he will\\ngive it to him. Stannis refuses, saying it is his. Renly states he refuses a peach, a castle and did not come to his\\nwedding. Stannis sneers that the wedding was a farce, considering Renly married a woman he was scheming to\\nmake one of Robert’s whores a year before. Renly corrects this, saying he was going to make \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n his\\nqueen, but Robert was killed by a boar, and so he got Margaery. He reveals he plans to have a son with her within a\\nyear, and then asks Stannis how many sons he has, telling him that if he had \\na wife that looked like Stannis\\'s\\n, he\\nwould send \\nhis fool\\n to service her as well. Infuriated, Stannis draws his blade which shines strangely, roaring that he\\nwill not tolerate Renly mocking him to his face, but Brienne moves between them. Stannis tells Renly that he will\\nnot kill Renly with \\nLightbringer\\n, and will give him till dawn to pledge to him, for the sake of their \\nlate mother\\n. In\\nreturn, Stannis will grant him Storm’s End, a seat on the council, and name him his heir until he has a son; otherwise\\nhe will destroy Renly. Renly laughs, pointing out that he has the strength in banners: \\nHouse Rowan\\n, \\nHouse Tarly\\n,\\nHouse Caron\\n, \\nHouse Tarth\\n, \\nHouse Penrose\\n, \\nHouse Fossoway\\n, \\nHouse Cuy\\n, \\nHouse Mullendore\\n, \\nHouse Estermont\\n,\\nHouse Selmy\\n, \\nHouse Hightower\\n, \\nHouse Oakheart\\n, \\nHouse Crane\\n, \\nHouse Caswell\\n, \\nHouse Blackbar\\n, \\nHouse Morrigen\\n,\\nHouse Beesbury\\n, \\nHouse Shermer\\n, \\nHouse Dunn\\n, \\nHouse Footly\\n and Stannis\\' wife’s \\nHouse Florent\\n. What is present is\\nonly the vanguard, with 100,000 foot still to arrive. After exchanging taunts, Stannis gallops away, the Red Priestess\\nstaying long enough to say before also leaving:\\nLook to your own sins, Lord Renly.\\nCatelyn tells Renly that his brother is the lawful heir if Joffrey is Jaime’s son. Renly replies this is true only while he\\nlives, and asks if Catelyn would agree that it is a fool’s law since he would be a better king than either Robert or\\nStannis. He will be a great king:\\nstrong yet generous, clever, just, diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of\\nforgiveness, patient-\\nCatelyn adds\\n-humble?\\nRenly laughs and states\\nYou must allow a king some flaws, my lady.\\nCatelyn feels very tired; she has failed, and her son will have to face the Lannisters alone while the Baratheon\\nbrothers destroy each other. She thinks how much Renly is like his brother Robert, but Robert had Eddard to temper\\nhim. Eddard would have prevailed on Robert to bring the whole force to besiege Stannis, the besieger, instead of\\nforging ahead with only the horses and no fodder. Now he must come to battle soon or starve. Catelyn accompanies\\nRenly back to his pavilion, sending Hal Mollen to tend to the horses.\\nOnce inside, Renly states his brother has not changed, and since he will not take his gifts, maybe he should fight.\\n\\nLord \\nMathis Rowan\\n points out that the castle is well provisioned and has a strong garrison under Ser \\nCortnay\\nPenrose\\n; they can let Stannis have a profitless siege. Renly, however, is concerned that men will say he fears\\nStannis. Lord \\nRandyll Tarly\\n thinks they cannot leave him unblooded since he may grow stronger than Renly, and the\\nothers seem to agree. Renly decides that they will fight. At this, Catelyn sees no point in not returning to Riverrun,\\nso she asks to leave, but is told she cannot; she must watch so she can tell her son what happens to rebels.\\nRenly then gives command of the center to Lord Mathis Rowan, the left to \\nBryce Caron\\n, and the reserve to Lord\\nEldon Estermont\\n, while Renly takes the right. Lord Mathis Rowan asks who will have the van, and Ser \\nJon\\nFossoway\\n first asks the honor, but Ser \\nGuyard the Green\\n states that it should be one of the seven. \\nRandyll Tarly\\nstates he led \\nMace Tyrell\\n’s van since before most of those present were born. After a clamor fills the pavilion, Renly\\ngives the honor to Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n. Ser Loras accepts and asks for one of his knights to ride beside him, so that the\\nstag and rose can go to battle side by side. Renly gives Brienne this honor. She wants to fight by his side, but is told\\nthat there are four of the \\nRainbow Guard\\n that will fight beside him. She accepts the duty, but requests that she arm\\nhim for battle. Renly accepts. Catelyn can hear someone snigger. Renly then asks them to leave him.\\nBefore she leaves, Catelyn asks to visit a sept she saw in a village, and Renly tells Ser \\nRobar Royce\\n to provide an\\nescort, but to return by dawn. Catelyn tells him he should also pray, not for victory but for wisdom. Renly tells Ser\\nLoras to remain with him to help him pray.\\nSer Robar Royce is a member of the Rainbow guard and Catelyn knows him slightly, that he is known for his skill in\\nthe tourney, the son of \\nYohn Royce\\n, bannerman to \\nHouse Arryn\\n.

Sansa is being beaten by \\nBoros\\nBlount\\n when \\nTyrion Lannister\\n arrives. He stops the beating and has her taken to the \\nTower of the Hand\\n to be\\ncleaned up and treated. The next morning he offers her protection, but she refuses.\\nSynopsis\\nSandor Clegane\\n is telling \\nSansa\\n that if she keeps \\nJoffrey\\n waiting it will only be worse. As Sansa is making herself\\npretty for Joffrey, she wonders if Joffrey has heard about her meetings with Ser \\nDontos\\n. As they are walking, Sansa\\nasks the \\nHound\\n what she has done and is told that it is what her kingly brother \\nRobb Stark\\n has done. Sansa tells the\\nHound that Robb is the traitor and she had no part; she can only think that if Robb harmed \\nJaime Lannister\\n she will\\nhave to face Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n. The Hound tells her again that they trained her well, calling her a little bird.\\nShe is led to the lower bailey where a crowd is gathered. She can hear Lord \\nGyles Rosby\\n coughing as they part to let\\nher pass. Ser \\nHoras Redwyne\\n and \\nHobber Redwyne\\n avoid her gaze as she passes. There is a cat shot by a bolt\\nmewling on the ground. Ser Dontos, riding a broomstick as commanded by the king, whispers to her to “Be brave.”\\nIn the center stands Joffrey with Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n and Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n beside him. She kneels before him, but\\nJoffrey snaps that kneeling will not save her and she must answer for her brother’s treasons. She is slow to get up,\\nand the Hound, not ungently, pulls her up when commanded.\\nSer \\nLancel Lannister\\n now speaks to her, claiming that Robb fell upon Ser \\nStafford Lannister\\n with an army of \\nwargs\\nnear \\nLannisport\\n, using some \\nsorcery\\n. Thousands of men were butchered as they slept. According to Lancel, the\\nnorthmen\\n feasted on their flesh after the slaughter.\\nJoffrey asks if she has anything to say. Ser Dontos tells him that she is shocked witless. Joffrey then brings up that\\nher \\ndirewolf\\n savaged him, and Sansa retorts that it was \\nArya\\n\\'s wolf (\\nNymeria\\n), and that he killed \\nLady\\n even though\\nshe never hurt him. Joffrey replies that it was \\nEddard Stark\\n that killed Lady, and he killed him. Joffrey then recounts\\nhow he shot a man in the throat at the gates that was bigger than her father. He would shoot her also but \\nCersei\\n says\\nthey will kill \\nJaime\\n. He then commands the Hound to hit Sansa, but Ser Dontos intervenes by wacking her over the\\nhead with his morning star—a melon on the end of a stick. People are laughing, but, despite Sansa’s prayers, Joffrey\\ndoes not. Instead he calls to his \\nKingsguard\\n, telling them to save her face. Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n flings Dontos down\\nwhile Ser Boros first slams a fist into Sansa’s belly, and then starts to lay the flat of his blade across her thighs. The\\nHound rasps “Enough,” but the king orders Boros to make her naked and he tears the silk of her bodice away\\nexposing her breasts. She can hear sniggers as Joffery orders her beat bloody.\\nAt that point, a voice demands \\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\\n. Sansa looks to see the arrival of a furious \\nTyrion\\nLannister\\n, flanked by \\nhis sellsword\\n and \\none of his tribesmen\\n who demands Blount tell him what sort of \\nknight\\n beats\\nhelpless maids. Ser Boros replies one that serves his king, drawing his sword, with Ser Meryn stepping beside him.\\nBronn warns them to be careful, as they don’t want to get blood all over their white cloaks. Tryion asks for someone\\nto give Sansa something to cover herself with, and Sandor tosses her his cloak. Tyrion then asks Joffrey whether he\\nhas no regard for her honor, considering that she is to be his queen one day. Joffrey replies that he is punishing her\\nfor having the blood of the wolf, and Tyrion replies that Joffrey has the wits of a goose. Joffrey insists that the king\\ncan do as he likes, and Tyrion asks if he knows what happened to \\nAerys II Targaryen\\n, who also did what he liked.\\n\\nSer Boros warns Tyrion that no one is to threaten the king, but Tyrion responds he is only educating him, and then\\ntells Bronn and Timett to kill Ser Boros if he opens his mouth again.\\nWhen Ser Boros, turning red, states the queen will hear of this, Tyrion asks if they should send for Cersei. When\\nJoffrey has nothing to say, Tyrion tells him to learn to use his ears more and his mouth less, lest his reign be shorter\\nthan Tyrion himself. He points out that brutality will not win his people’s love, nor his queen’s. Joffrey replies that\\nCersei taught him to value fear over love, and Sansa fears him. Tyrion only notes that it is a pity \\nStannis\\n and \\nRenly\\nare not twelve year-old girls as well.\\nTyrion then continues by ordering Bronn and Timett to bring Sansa. They take her to the \\nTower of the Hand\\n. She is\\nshaking and moving as if she were in a dream. Serving girls clean her up and Maester \\nFrenken\\n treats her wounds.\\nSansa thinks how the Hound hated knights, and now she hates them also, and she does not believe they are true\\nknights. She sleeps.\\nShe wakes that night and her legs pain her when she gets up. Outside her door, she finds \\na woman\\n whom she tells\\nshe wants to go to the \\ngodswood\\n; she wants to find Ser Dontos and beg him to take her home before it is too late.\\nThe woman tells her that Tyrion said she was not to leave. When food comes in the morning she tells the servant to\\ntake it away. Later, Tyrion arrives and tells her that she is a guest, not a prisoner.\\nTyrion then tells the story of Robb’s victory. Ser Stafford’s host was encamped outside \\nOxcross\\n. He explains that\\nthere were no army of wargs or sorcery involved as Ser Lancel claimed, as Lancel wouldn’t know a warg from a\\nwart and according to Tyrion, \\n\"sorcery is the sauce men spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own\\nincompetence\"\\n. Robb’s soldiers crept into the camp and cut the horse lines, and then Robb sent his \\ndirewolf\\n among\\nthem, causing a stampede. The panicked horses trampled the camp, killing many. Most of the rest fled in terror,\\ncasting aside their weapons. Among the dead are Ser Stafford (killed by Lord \\nRickard Karstark\\n), Ser \\nRupert Brax\\n,\\nSer \\nLymond Vikary\\n, Lord \\nCrakehall\\n, and Lord \\nAntario Jast\\n. Fifty have been taken prisoner including Jast’s sons and\\nMartyn Lannister\\n. The incompetent Ser Stafford had not even bothered to post sentries, thinking himself safe and\\nsecure in the Westerlands and most of his army were raw recruits, the sweepings of \\nLannisport\\n. The only mystery is\\nhow Robb reached Oxcross since \\nLannister\\n forces hold the \\nGolden Tooth\\n and the men stationed there swear Robb\\ndidn\\'t pass them. Tyrion ultimately declares it unimportant; Robb Stark is \\nhis father\\n\\'s problem, while Joffrey is his.\\nTyrion then asks Sansa how she feels about his nephew and she responds that she loves him with all her heart, more\\nthan ever. Tyrion is amused and tells her someone taught her to lie well, which she may be grateful for one day. He\\nthen asks if she has flowered, to which she answers no. He says that is good, and that he does not intend for her to\\nmarry Joffrey, since there will never be a reconciliation between the Lannisters and \\nStarks\\n with the way Joffrey has\\nacted, calling it a pity as the marriage was one of \\nRobert I Baratheon\\n’s better notions. Sansa is concerned that this is\\na trick and states she only wants to be loyal. Tyrion adds \"...and far from any Lannisters\", but admits he cannot\\nblame her, as when he was her age, he wanted the same thing.\\nHe then notes that she visits the godswood every day and asks what she prays for. Sansa prays for Robb’s victory\\nand Joffrey’s death, but claims she prays for an end to the fighting. Tyrion tells her there will be another battle\\nbetween Robb and \\nTywin Lannister\\n and that will settle the issue, warning her not to think that Oxcross was\\nsignificant, and to pray that her brother bends his knee, and he will return her to \\nWinterfell\\n once there is peace. He\\noffers to have some of his \\nclansmen\\n guard her, maybe \\nChella\\n if she prefers a woman. Sansa, thinking about Ser\\nDontos rescuing her, tells him that the wildlings frighten her. He responds that they also frighten Joffrey and the\\nlickspittles and sycophants who make up his Kingsguard so no one would harm her. When she tells him she would\\nprefer sleeping in her own bed and the tower is where her father’s men were slain, and their ghosts give her bad\\ndreams, he agrees to have her escorted back to her bedchamber.\\nNavigation:\\nSansa II\\n↑\\nCatelyn III\\n ←\\nSansa III\\n→ \\nCatelyn IV\\n↓\\nSansa IV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 33: Catelyn IV\\nPlace(s): \\nA village near \\nStorm\\'s End\\n - Outside the walls of \\nStorm\\'s End\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn III\\n↑\\nSansa III\\n ←\\nCatelyn IV\\n→ \\nJon IV\\n↓\\nCatelyn V\\nCatelyn\\n prays to the seven in a sept in a small village. As she prays, the realization comes to her that both \\nEddard\\nStark\\n and \\nJon Arryn\\n died for their knowledge of \\nCersei’s\\n incest, and that \\nBran\\n also knows. She arrives back at \\nRenly\\nBaratheon\\n\\'s pavillion, where \\nBrienne of Tarth\\n prepares him for battle. She asks Renly to call a Great Council with\\nhis brother and \\nRobb\\n to let Bran tell what he saw. He refuses to support the concept. Then, a shadow kills Renly.\\nWhen the guards arrive, it is assumed that Brienne killed him. Catelyn escapes with her, and they join Catelyn’s\\nparty to leave.\\nSynopsis\\nIt is full dark before \\nCatelyn\\n, Ser \\nWendel Manderly\\n and Ser \\nRobar Royce\\n arrive at the village. The sept’s seven\\nwalls—one for each god—are cracked and crooked. She enters alone. Catelyn remembers Septon \\nOsmynd\\n telling\\nher every god is one with seven aspects. In \\nWinterfell\\n, Septon \\nChayle\\n hung carved masks, but here they are but\\nrough chalk drawings. Catelyn prays to the Mother to spare them if she can, and spare her own sons. She wonders if\\nEddard Stark\\n’s gods ever answered him, and looks around. The Father’s face reminds her of her dying father \\nHoster\\nTully\\n, the Warrior of \\nRenly Baratheon\\n, \\nStannis Baratheon\\n, \\nRobert Baratheon\\n, \\nRobb\\n, \\nJaime Lannister\\n, \\nJon Snow\\n, and\\nfor a second she sees \\nArya\\n. The smoke burns her eyes, and, after rubbing them, she sees her mother \\nMinisa Tully\\n,\\nwho died in childbirth, in the face of the Mother. When her head starts swimming, she realizes she has not eaten\\ntoday; food lost its savor when \\nNed\\n died. Then she thinks she can see \\nLysa’s\\n face, but the eyes are too hard; it is the\\nface of \\nCersei\\n. She first wonders if Cersei prays to the seven also, and then thinks if Robert, who did not regard\\nJoffrey\\n with any warmth, knew that the boy was of Jaime’s seed would have put both him and his mother to death\\nand few would condemn him. The children born of incest are considered abominations by the followers of both the\\nold gods\\n and the Seven; only among \\nthe Targaryens\\n was such practices common. She realises Eddard and \\nJon Arryn\\nmust have both known, hence why Cersei had them both killed, and she suddenly realizes \\nBran\\n knows also. She\\nprays to the different gods for her children. Ser Robar interrupts her prayers to tell her they must leave to be back\\nbefore dawn.\\nThey pass through the army, and to Catelyn it seems like grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners. At Renly’s\\npavilion, Ser \\nParmen Crane\\n and Ser \\nEmmon Cuy\\n of the \\nRainbow Guard\\n stand guard outside while inside, \\nBrienne of\\nTarth\\n is armoring the king and Lords \\nRandyll Tarly\\n and \\nMathis Rowan\\n are speaking of dispositions and tactics.\\nCatelyn asks to speak to Renly, but he tells her to wait. Lord Mathis is telling Renly that they should advance before\\ndawn since the soldiers are in position, and Lord Rowan is agreeing since if they wait, they will charge into the\\nrising sun, but Renly will not have it said his victory was won by treachery. Renly is sure that Ser Loras will break\\nthe first of Stannis\\' lines. Renly commands that when his brother falls, his body be treated with respect. When Lord\\nTarly asks what to do if Stannis yields, both Renly and Lord Rowan are amused, and Renly recounts how Ser\\nGawen Wylde\\n tried to escape to surrender to \\nMace Tyrell\\n during the siege of \\nStorm\\'s End\\n, and Stannis was going to\\nhurl him out using a catapult. He was only dissuaded by Maester \\nCressen\\n telling him they might have to eat their\\ndead; mercifully, the \\nOnion Knight\\n saved them from having to eat the flesh of corpses, though Renly notes this was\\nlittle comfort for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell. Renly, assuming Ser \\nBarristan Selmy\\n will be with Stannis (since\\nSer Barristan is neither with him nor with Robb and wants to guard a king), states he wants him spared. Finally,\\nRenly is ready to hear from Catelyn, the lords departing.\\nCatelyn now tells Renly that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran, explaining that there was a hunt the day he fell, and\\n\\nwhile Robert, Ned and most of the other men were gone, both Jaime Lannister and the queen remained at Winterfell.\\nShe then beseeches Renly to set aside the crown, along with his brother, and Robb would do the same. Then they\\ncould call a \\nGreat Council\\n where Bran will tell his tale so the realm will know the Lannisters are true usurpers.\\nRenly tells her the time for talk is done. As Brienne is kneeling, belting on Renly’s long sword and dagger, a breeze\\nseems to fling open the tent flap. Then, Catelyn sees \\na shadow lifting a sword\\n that takes Renly in the throat. Brienne\\ncatches Renly as he stumbles into her, his blood flowing over her armor. Ser Robar and Ser Emmon come rushing\\nin, and, seeing Brienne covered in Renly’s blood, immediately assume she killed him. Ser Emmon immediately\\nattacks with a battleaxe as Catelyn screams “No!”. Brienne is soon in battle with Ser Emmon and the two men-at-\\narms with them. Catelyn starts to tell Ser Robar, who hangs back uncertainly, that is was Stannis, only being able to\\nexplain it as some sort of sorcery, a shadow, swearing on her husband’s grave and her honor. Ser Robar promises to\\nhold them off and leaves the tent. Brienne has taken out the men-at-arms but now the armored Ser Emmon is in her\\nwool. Catelyn bashes an iron brazier over Ser Emmon’s helm, sending him to his knees and Brienne, seeing the\\nchance, slashes through the tent side. Catelyn tells her to follow her slowly so they do not raise suspicions.\\nBrienne has seen nothing, and Catelyn tells her it was a shadow, and she could feel Stannis. Brienne swears she will\\nkill Stannis with Renly’s sword. They arrive at the camp, and Catelyn explains that Renly is dead, and there will be\\nno battle. She tells Brienne to select one of the many spare horses; they have to be far away before they look for\\nthem, so she does not have time to get her own armor and horse. Catelyn tells them to ride, and cut down anyone\\nthat tries to stop them.\\nCatelyn thinks how all of Renly’s power will now belong to Stannis, won in a single evil stroke; the lords present\\nwill have no choice but to side with the last Baratheon. Then she thinks how Stannis has also declared Robb a traitor\\nwho must be punished, and a chill goes through her as she recalls Stannis\\'s threat that Robb\\'s time will come.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn III\\n↑\\nSansa III\\n ←\\nCatelyn IV\\n→ \\nJon IV\\n↓\\nCatelyn V\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 34: Jon IV\\nPlace(s): \\nFist of the First Men\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon III\\n↑\\nCatelyn IV\\n ←\\nJon IV\\n→ \\nBran V\\n↓\\nJon V\\nLord Commander\\n \\nMormont\\n\\'s men reach the \\nFist of the First Men\\n.

Ghost leads him to some buried \\nDragonglass\\n weapons wrapped in a cloak\\nof the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nLord Commander \\nMormont\\n\\'s men arrive at the \\nFist of the First Men\\n. \\nJon Snow\\n thinks that it actually looks like a fist\\nplunging up from the ground. The commander tells \\nThoren Smallwood\\n it is good ground, and he replies it is an old\\nplace that is strong and will be easy to defend. The commander agrees they are not likely to find a better place to\\ndefend. Its disadvantage, pointed out by Jon, is that they will have to climb down to get water. Their camp is made\\nbehind a stone ring built by the \\nFirst Men\\n during the \\nDawn Age\\n.\\nAs they climbed, \\nGhost\\n ran off, and Jon had to keep calling him back, but the commander finally grew impatient and\\ntold Jon to let him go. Jon Snow can tell the travelling is wearing on the Lord Commander, but he tries not to let it\\nshow.\\nAfter putting up the Lord Commander’s tent and seeing to the horses, he descends to find Ghost, who suddenly\\nappears next to him. He feels a growing sense of foreboding. He climbs some rocks from where he can see the\\nMilkwater\\n river and the rugged landscape giving way to high stony hills to the north. When darkness starts to arrive,\\nJon is interrupted by \\nSamwell Tarly\\n. Jon tells Sam that the commander plans to stay here and wait for \\nQhorin\\nHalfhand\\n and the men from the \\nShadow Tower\\n, and he should get a raven ready since the commander will want to\\nsend a message. Sam states the ravens hate being caged, and if he could fly he would be back at \\nCastle Black\\n and be\\neating pork pie.\\nThey return to camp. Overhead, the red tail of \\nMormont’s Torch\\n is as bright as the moon. When they arrive, Jon\\nleaves to attend to the Lord Commander. Mormont, who is talking to some of his officers, tells Jon to bring some\\nhot spiced wine. As he prepares the wine, he hears \\nJarman Buckwell\\n state that following the Milkwater would be the\\neasiest road to the \\nFrostfangs\\n, but \\nMance Rayder\\n will know of their approach. Ser \\nMallador Locke\\n recommends\\nGiant\\'s Stair\\n or \\nSkirling Pass\\n. Mormont states he does not want to risk the Frostfangs unless he must. He plans to\\nremain at the Fist since the \\nWildlings\\n outnumber them, and the Wildlings will have to come from the Frostfangs\\neventually for food; they will strengthen their defenses. The rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river\\nsince Mormont is sure that \\nCraster\\n did not lie to them about Mance gathering his force in the Frostfangs. The\\nofficers finish their wine and leave.\\nJon offers the commander supper, and he asks if Ghost found any game since they could use meat, and then asks if\\nJon agrees with keeping the rangers close. Jon replies that if they stay close, they are unlikely to find his uncle\\nBenjen Stark\\n. The commander responds that it would be easier for one man to find 200 than for 200 to find one, and\\nthe land is too vast to search with their limited manpower. They have left a very visible trail, and the fires on the Fist\\nshould be visible to the foothills of the Frostfangs. Jon then brings up the case that his uncle is dead, and the\\ncommander replies that he still may return anyway as a \\nWight\\n. The commander then tells Jon he will forsake supper\\n\\nand to wake him at first light.\\nHowever, Jon is hungry, and joins \\nDywen\\n, \\nGrenn\\n, \\nDolorous Edd\\n, and \\nHake\\n for the stew. Dywen states there is a\\nsmell he does not like, a smell of cold. Jon hears a howling and then Ghost appears, surprising Jon since he has\\npreviously refused to come inside the ring. Ghost seems preoccupied, sniffing the air. Suddenly Jon is alarmed since\\nGhost knew when the dead came walking, and Dywen has said he smelled cold. Ghost starts to go, and then looks\\nback, so Jon follows, leaving the protection of the ring. Ghost stops at the stream, and then goes on, so Jon follows,\\nangry. He loses Ghost a quarter of the way around the Fist. When he catches up with Ghost again, he is digging at a\\nmound that has been dug only recently. He expects to find a body, but finds a bundle two feet across. Inside the\\nbundle made from a cloak of the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n, he finds \\nDragonglass\\n weapons.\\nNavigation:\\nJon III\\n↑\\nCatelyn IV\\n ←\\nJon IV\\n→ \\nBran V\\n↓\\nJon V\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 35: Bran V\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nBran IV\\n↑\\nJon IV\\n ←\\nBran V\\n→ \\nTyrion VIII\\n↓\\nBran VI\\nBran\\n learns of his brother\\'s victory, and the death of Ser \\nStevron Frey\\n, and realizes that \\nJojen Reed\\n\\'s prophesy has\\ncome true.

Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n finally returns with a prisoner, \\nReek\\n, who was involved\\nin the forced marriage and then murder of Lady \\nHornwood\\n. Jojen reveals to Bran that he had a green dream in which\\nReek is skinning off Bran\\'s face.\\nSynopsis\\nBran\\n is found working the bellows for \\nMikken\\n by \\nAlebelly\\n to tell him that there has been a bird from \\nRobb Stark\\n.\\nBran lets Alebelly carry him to Maester \\nLuwin\\n\\'s turret where \\nRickon\\n already waits.

He has also\\ncaptured several castles, and is currently at \\nAshemark\\n, the stronghold of \\nHouse Marbrand\\n. Rickon asks if Robb is\\ncoming home, but Bran knows that only Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n matters, as \\nBig Walder\\n states, which disquiets him.\\nNeither Big Walder nor \\nLittle Walder\\n seem upset about their uncle Ser \\nStevron Frey\\n\\'s death, who, they note, was\\nvery old (50 or 60) and always tired.

Little Walder states theat\\nRyman is too old, and then asks if they think he will be lord, and Big Walder responds he will be lord and does not\\ncare. The maester tells them that they should be ashamed.\\nOsha\\n arrives to carry him; she is stronger than Alebelly. Bran asks if she knows the way north, and she tells him it is\\neasy. He then asks if the \\nchildren of the forest\\n, the \\nOthers\\n and \\ngiants\\n are still there and she tells him she has seen\\ngiants and heard of the others. He then asks about the \\nthree-eyed crow\\n, which she has never heard of. She sets him\\non the window seat of his bedchamber.\\nShortly thereafter, \\nJojen\\n enters the room unbidden with \\nMeera\\n behind him. Bran asks Jojen if he has heard about the\\nbird; he states it was not supper, it was a letter from Robb. Jojen explains that the \\ngreen dreams\\n are not easy to\\nunderstand. When Bran asks Jojen to tell him his dream, Jojen reveals that he dreamed the sea was lapping all\\naround Winterfell. Waves crashed against the gates and towers, and the water came flowing over the walls and filled\\nthe castle. Drowned men were floating in the yard. He now recognizes these men and declares that they are Alebelly,\\nSepton \\nChayle\\n, and \\nMikken\\n. Bran, confused and dismayed, replies that the sea is hundreds of leagues away, and\\nWinterfell\\'s walls are so high the water could not get in even if it did come. Jojen only repeats his claim, adding that\\nhe saw the dead, bloated and drowned.\\nBran wants to warn the men, but Jojen tells him it will not save them, as they will not believe him. He then asks\\nBran to tell of his wolf dream, and Bran replies that there are different kinds. There are the wolf dreams, which are\\nnot as bad as the others, in which he runs, hunts and kills squirrels. He has other dreams where the crow comes and\\ntells him to fly. Sometimes the tree is also calling his name in those dreams, which frightens him, but not as much as\\nwhen he falls. He explains that he never used to fall while climbing, and that he used to feed the crows in the Burned\\nTower. Yet, he did fall eventually, and now when he sleeps he falls all the time.\\nJojen tells Bran that he will be called a \\nwarg\\n if others hear of his wolf dreams, and some will hate him in fear, as the\\npower is strong in him. Bran is concerned since in \\nOld Nan\\n\\'s stories wargs were always evil, and tells Jojen that he\\n\\nwants to be a \\nknight\\n. Jojen replies that he is a winged wolf but will never fly unless he opens the eye in his forehead,\\nand he must search for it with his heart. When Bran states that Maester Luwin claims dreams are just that, Jojen\\nresponds they are the past, the future, and truth. With that they leave him, and Bran tries unsuccessfully to open his\\nthird eye.\\nOn the following days, Bran tries to warn his household, but no one seems to believe him. Mikken thinks it funny,\\nand states he always wanted to see the sea. Septon Chayle states the gods will take him when they do, and he does\\nnot think he will drown since he grew up on the banks of the \\nWhite Knife\\n. Alebelly takes heed, and refuses to bathe\\nor go near a well until finally other guardsmen give him a bath because he stinks so badly.\\nSer \\nRodrik Cassel\\n returns with a man that \\nHayhead\\n tells Bran is named \\nReek\\n. He served the now-dead \\nRamsay\\nSnow\\n (the Bastard of Bolton). The bastard and Reek murdered Lady \\nHornwood\\n. Rodrik’s men shot Snow as he\\nattempted to ride away. He had forced Lady Hornwood to marry him and then to sign a will naming him heir. Ser\\nRodrik is concerned that \\nRoose Bolton\\n may not agree that doing this under duress would make the marriage and the\\nwill invalid. Rodrik wants to keep Reek alive for judgement when Robb returns. Meanwhile, \\nHouse Manderly\\n and\\nHouse Bolton\\n are fighting in the \\nHornwood\\n forest, and Rodrik does not have the strength to stop them.\\nSer Rodrik then brings up Bran commanding Alebelly not to bathe. Bran tells him about the green dream. Maester\\nLuwin tells Rodrik that he has explained to Bran the uncertainty of prophesies, but then notes that raiders in\\nlongships have been plundering and raping along the \\nStony Shore\\n, and \\nLeobald Tallhart\\n sent his nephew \\nBenfred\\nTallhart\\n to deal with it. After he gets more information about the green dream, Rodrik promises not to take Alebelly\\nwith him if he rides against the raiders. Bran takes some hope in this.\\nWhen Bran meets with the \\nReeds\\n later that night, Meera agrees that it should be possible to change prophesies.\\nMeera gets angry with her brother when he disagrees, claiming that what he sees always comes true. Then Meera\\nstates that Alebelly and Bran should both fight to avoid their fates. Bran asks if he drowns also and Jojen reveals\\nanother dream of his, in which Bran and Rickon lay dead at Reek\\'s feet, and he was skinning off their faces with a\\nlong red blade.

To recruit them,\\nTyrion recommends that Joffrey marry \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n. \\nCersei\\n does not like the idea, stating Joffrey will not like it,\\nbut eventually agrees. Neither Cersei nor Tyrion want to leave King’s Landing to meet with the Tyrells but\\nLittlefinger\\n volunteers, expecting a reward for his service.\\nSynopsis\\nVarys\\n reports the \\nmysterious murder\\n of \\nRenly\\n, whose throat was cut like soft cheese. The reports of the murderer\\nvary: Stannis with a \\nmagic sword\\n, a knight of his \\nRainbow Guard\\n, a maid, a woman spurned, or Lady \\nCatelyn Stark\\n.\\nThe \\nsmall council\\n, including \\nCersei\\n, \\nTyrion\\n, and \\nLittlefinger\\n, are not pleased with the report since they expect the\\ntruth, not rumors. Varys assures them it is not a ruse, and that Renly is dead.\\nTyrion notes that \\nJoffrey\\n will not be happy since he was reserving a spike for Renly’s head. Tyrion himself is also\\nunhappy since he was depending on the brothers to decimate each other\\'s armies in battle, but points out the killer\\'s\\nidentity is irrelevant; Stannis has to be behind Renly\\'s death, as he stood to gain the most from it.\\nVarys reports the foot remain at \\nBitterbridge\\n and most of the lords have gone over to \\nStannis Baratheon\\n with, as\\nLittlefinger assumed, Lord \\nAlester Florent\\n being first. \\nLoras Tyrell\\n, \\nRandyll Tarly\\n, and \\nMathis Rowan\\n did not\\nswitch allegiance, and Ser \\nCortnay Penrose\\n will not yield \\nStorm\\'s End\\n until he sees Renly’s body, which has\\ndisappeared. A fifth of the knights left with Loras, who had killed three of Renly’s guards in anger, including\\nEmmon Cuy\\n and \\nRobar Royce\\n. Loras is probably headed to Bitterbridge for his sister \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n and the foot\\nstill there. Tyrion notes that this is an opportunity to win the Tyrells to their cause; they may have loved Renly, but\\nperhaps they can be convinced to prefer Joffrey over Stannis. Littlefinger suggests bribes, but both Varys and Tyrion\\ndo not think gold will win \\nHighgarden\\n. Littlefinger admits they are right, and states that Loras, although a younger\\nson, is \\nMace Tyrell\\n’s favorite, so they just have to win him. Tyrion suggests marrying 15- or 16-year-old Margaery\\nto the 13-year-old Joffrey. Cersei objects that Joffrey is promised to \\nSansa Stark\\n, but Tyrion responds that there is no\\nadvantage in wedding the king to the daughter of a \\ndead traitor\\n. Littlefinger adds that the Tyrells are wealthier than\\nthe \\nStarks\\n and Margaery is lovely and beddable.\\nWhen Tyrion states that Joffrey should like this, Cersei replies her son is too young to care about such things. Tyrion\\nnotes that he was the same age as Joffrey when he married. Cersei insists that Joffrey is made of finer stuff, but\\nTyrion reminds her that he ordered Sansa stripped by Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n.\\nTyrion has spoken to Varys about arranging a secret visit to \\nChataya\\n’s for Joffrey; Tyrion hopes that it will sweeten\\nhim. He noted that they will have to arrange to do it when \\nSandor Clegane\\n is busy. Varys agreed to look into the\\nmatter.\\nTyrion tells Cersei that the marriage may be the only way for Joffrey to live to his wedding night and Littlefinger\\nadds that Sansa brings only her body to Joffrey’s bed, while Margaery would bring 50,000 swords. Varys adds that\\nthe needs of the realm come before the king’s own desires. Cersei states that the king would never agree to Renly’s\\nleavings, and Tyrion replies that when the king comes of age in 3 years he can make his own decisions, but until\\n\\nthen he does as the \\nHand of the King\\n and the regent say. Cersei agrees but warns them if Joffrey does not like\\nMargaery.\\nTyrion brings up the need to send one of them to Bitterbridge before Loras’ blood cools; Loras will scarcely deal\\nwith \\nBronn\\n or \\nShagga\\n. Cersei first recommends Ser \\nJacelyn Bywater\\n, but Tyrion points out that whoever they send\\nmust be able to make decisions for the king and council. Cersei recommends Tyrion as \\nHand of the King\\n and Tyrion\\nrecommends Cersei as the king’s mother. Littlefinger volunteers, stating he would make a poor hostage and neither\\nLoras nor Mace bears any enmity towards him. Tyrion does not like it since he does not trust Littlefinger but if he\\nleaves \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n for any time, everything he worked for would be undone. There is fighting on the route to\\nBitterbridge, so Littlefinger will need a strong escort. Tyrion initially offers 100 \\ngold cloaks\\n and they agree on 300\\nplus 40 knights with squires to give Littlefinger a knightly tail to impress the Tyrells. Littlefinger states he will take\\nHoras Redwyne\\n and \\nHobber Redwyne\\n (Horror and Slobber) who will be sent on to their father as a gesture of good\\nwill since \\nPaxter Redwyne\\n is an old friend of Mace Tyrell\\'s. Cersei expresses wrath at this since \\nHouse Redwyne\\nwould have declared for Renly except for the twins being held hostage. Littlefinger notes that Renly is dead and\\nStannis and Lord Paxter have an enmity against each other from the siege of Storm\\'s End. Tyrion decides to send Ser\\nHobber and keep Ser Horas in King’s Landing. Littlefinger also demands plenty of horses and gold, and a\\ncommission in writing, which Tyrion agrees to, so Littlefinger states he will start before dawn, but is expecting a\\nsuitable reward for his services. Cersei asks him what he wants, and Littlefinger replies he will think about it. Tyrion\\ninstructs Varys to get parchment and quill, and they will need someone to wake Joffrey.\\nCersei asks Tyrion about his chain, and he tells her it is getting longer link by link, and that they should thank Ser\\nCortnay since Stannis will not march north with Storm’s End untaken. Cersei now tells Tyrion that he has been a\\ngreat help, contrary to what she expected, and kisses him on the brow.\\nWhen Cersei leaves, Tyrion tells Bronn that Cersei is up to something, and asks Bronn to try to find out what;\\nTyrion hates surprises.\\nSee Also\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VII\\n↑\\nBran V\\n ←\\nTyrion VIII\\n→ \\nTheon III\\n↓\\nTyrion IX\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 37: Theon III\\nPlace(s): \\nStony Shore\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTheon II\\n↑\\nTyrion VIII\\n ←\\nTheon III\\n→ \\nArya VIII\\n↓\\nTheon IV\\nAt the \\nStony Shore\\n, \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n and his men have won an easy victory against a force led by \\nBenfred Tallhart\\n.\\nFeeling dissatisfied, Theon meets with \\nDagmer\\n on Dagmer\\'s ship and admits to his feelings. He lays out a plan for\\nDagmer, which he means to proof himself worthy with to his father, Lord \\nBalon Greyjoy\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nTheon Greyjoy\\n\\'s men have defeated the \\nWild Hares\\n and have captured their leader, \\nBenfred Tallhart\\n. Theon\\nattempts to question Benfred, but the only replies he receives are threats about what \\nRobb Stark\\n will do to him and\\nBenfred\\'s spittle. Theon\\'s uncle, \\nAeron Greyjoy\\n, insists that Benfred be sacrificed to the \\nDrowned God\\n by drowning,\\nand Theon finally gives in. Aeron insists that Theon be in charge of Benfred\\'s execution, but Theon declines. As he\\nwalks away, Theon figures that being drowned might be a service to Benfred, since his neck is thick with muscle\\nand fat and \\nStygg\\n is not an expert headman. Theon thinks back to when he had spend a fortnight in Benfred\\'s\\ncompany three years ago when he had accompanied \\nEddard Stark\\n to \\nTorrhen\\'s Square\\n for a visit with Ser \\nHelman\\nTallhart\\n. During the entire fortnight, Theon had mocked Benfred\\'s neck, to see how angry he could make Benfred\\nfor it.\\nHe can hear the noise of his men celebrating their victory and climbes some stones to reach them. He watches the\\ndead men and horses on the ground; While \\nTymor\\n and his brothers had gathered the unhurt mounts, \\nUrzen\\n and\\nBlack \\nLorren\\n had killed those who could not be saved. He sees his men \"paying the iron price\" for their valuables by\\nlooting the corpses as the ironborn of old did. As he sees \\nGevin Harlaw\\n sawing off a man\\'s finger to get a ring,\\nTheon wonders whether he should search the two men he killed during the battle. However, the thought of what\\nEddard Stark\\n would say about it, which frustrates him. He then sees \\nMaron Botley\\n sitting by his pile of collected\\nplunder, to which his sons are adding. One of them is in a shoving match with an obviously drunk \\nTodric\\n. Theon\\nasks \\nWex Pyke\\n for his bow and plans to shoot the ale horn out of Todric\\'s hand, but as he looses his arrow Todric\\nmoves and is hit in the belly. This gets the attention of the other looters, whom Theon addresses, telling them that he\\nhad previously told them that he abides no drunkards and no squabbles over plunder. Theon orders Botley to silence\\nTodric. Botley and his sons are quick to obey and immediately strip the dead Todric of his valuables. Theon thinks\\nto himself that, although \\nhis father\\n has given him the command, some of his men see him as \"a soft boy from the\\ngreen lands\", and hopes that killing Todric has made them realize he means what he says.\\nTheon kicks Benfred\\'s banner, wondering about the \\nrabbit skin\\n tied to it and frustrated that he does not feel elated as\\nhe did after the \\nBattle of the Whispering Wood\\n. As he returns to his \\nSea Bitch\\n, he sees Benfred\\'s limp body being\\ndragged from the water.\\nTheon is bothered by the fact that all of his work, including the attack on the fishing village, will be put down to\\nraiders, as word about the hosting of the \\nIron Islands\\n has been effectively kept secret. He knows the northmen will\\nnot realize their peril until \\nDeepwood Motte\\n and \\nMoat Cailin\\n are attacked and bitterly thinks to himself that songs\\nwill be sung for Asha after all is over, while he will be forgotten. He is determined not to allow that to happen.\\nTheon goes to \\nFoamdrinker\\n, where he finds \\nDagmer\\n, who he had left behind to guard the ships to prevent him from\\ngetting credit for the successful attack. Dagmer notes that Theon does not smile despite the victory. Theon tells\\nDagmer that they need to talk, so he takes him to his cabin in \\nFoamdrinker\\n. There, Theon states that they did not\\n\\ncapture enough horses, and Dagmer asks why they need horses since Balon ordered them to only harry the coast.\\nTheon admits that he has a plan, hoping the tone in Dagmer\\'s voice he hears is interest, not disapproval.\\nTheon realizes he needs to use Dagmer\\'s pride when Dagmer states he is and always has been Balon\\'s best man. He\\ncomplements him with being the most skilled swordman and spearman on the Iron Islands, to which Dagmer\\ndisagrees. Although he used to be, he informs Theon that now \\nAndrik\\n, who serves Lord \\nDunstan Drumm\\n, and Black\\nLorren\\n and \\nQarl the Maid\\n are said to be the best. Theon counters, saying that Andrik is not nearly as feared as\\nDagmer and claiming that raiding is no work for \"Lord Balon\\'s best man\". Dagmer tells Theon that he is aware that\\nit is Theon who feels wasted, and Theon replies that it should have been him who had his sister\\'s command. Dagmer\\nexplains that, with Maron and Rodrik dead and Theon a hostage in the north, Balon had learned to rely on Asha,\\nwho has never failed him. Theon states that he has never failed Balon either, and that the \\nStarks\\n knew his worth. He\\ncites he was one of \\nBrynden Tully\\n\\'s picked scouts. He was in the first wave at Whispering Wood, and almost\\ncrossed swords with \\nJaime Lannister\\n, prevented only by the intervention of \\nDaryn Hornwood\\n, who died in the act.\\nDagmer tells Theon that he knows Theon is no craven, having trained him in his youth. He admits to Theno that the\\nStarks had Theon for ten years, and that \\nRobb Stark\\n is Theon\\'s friend. Theon replies that he is no \\nStark\\n but a\\nGreyjoy\\n, and means to be his father\\'s heir, but needs a way to prove himself in order to achieve that. Dagmer\\nreminds Theon that he is young and other wars will come in which he can prove his worth, but that they are now\\ncommanded to raid. At that, Theon reveals his plan; He will give Aeron six ships to raid, but means to \"do a deed\\nthat the harpers will sing of for a thousand years\", knowing that Dagmer loves to hear the song about the axe which\\nhad split his jaw in half. He tells Dagmer that he is to march on \\nTorrhen\\'s Square\\n, the seat of Ser \\nHelman Tallhart\\n.\\nHelman took his best men south, and Benfred and the sons of those men are now dead. All that remains is a small\\ngarrison under \\nLeobald Tallhart\\n. Dagmer is to make no secret of his approach and start building siege engines when\\nhe arrives. When Dagmer protests that siege engines are not the \\nironmen\\n\\'s way, Theon replies that Leobald will not\\nknow that. Upon seeing the siege engines, Leobald will call for help, and Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n, \\nWinterfell\\n\\'s castellan,\\nwill ride to Leobald\\'s aid in strength. Dagmer states he will certainly be outnumbered and cannot ever take Torrhen\\'s\\nSquare, but Theon replies that it is \\nnot Torrhen\\'s Square\\n he means to take.\\nNavigation:\\nTheon II\\n↑\\nTyrion VIII\\n ←\\nTheon III\\n→ \\nArya VIII\\n↓\\nTheon IV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 38: Arya VIII\\nPlace(s): \\nHarrenhal\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya VII\\n↑\\nTheon III\\n ←\\nArya VIII\\n→ \\nCatelyn V\\n↓\\nArya IX\\nTywin Lannister\\n’s host is leaving \\nHarrenhal\\n. Arya has been kept busy delivering messages for Weese, and she wants\\nto find \\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\n before he leaves. She finally finds Jaqen and gives him Weese’s name. As she watches \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n lead his host out of the castle, she realizes that she has been targeting the wrong people, people who really\\ndo not matter. She goes in search of Jaqen, but finds Weese’s dead body first.\\nSynopsis\\nThe Castle is in an uproar with preparations for \\nTywin Lannister\\n’s host’s departure. Ser \\nAddam Marbrand\\n was the\\nfirst to depart, a day before the rest. \\nWeese\\n calls Ser Addam a great horseman and sword fighter, and Lord Tywin’s\\nmost daring commander. Arya hopes Ser Addam and all his men die. She is sure that they are going to fight \\nRobb\\nStark\\n, and wonders what Robb has accomplished.\\nArya has been kept busy running messages from dawn to dust. She has even delivered messages beyond the wall,\\nand considered running away except that Weese told her he would deliver her to \\nVargo Hoat\\n; maybe if Weese were\\ndead. Weese does not know Arya can read, so he never seals his messages. That day, she delivers a message\\ndemanding payment for a debt to a knight who cannot read. She reads it to him, and he tries to hit her so she takes a\\nsilver banded drinking horn from him and flees, giving it to Weese. For this Arya is promised the reward of sharing\\na crisp capron with Weese that night. As she runs errands, she searches for \\nJaqen H\\'ghar\\n to give him another name\\nbefore he leaves. She finally asks a gate guard and is told that Ser \\nAmory Lorch\\n is to be castellan of \\nHarrenhal\\n, so\\nJaqen will not be leaving. The \\nBrave Companions\\n will also be left to do foraging. Unfortunately, the Mountain will\\nbe leaving to command Tywin’s van in battle, putting him, \\nDunsen\\n, \\nPolliver\\n, and \\nRafford\\n beyond reach.\\nWeese gives Arya a message for \\nLucan\\n that Ser \\nLyonel\\n, who is to ride with \\nKevan Lannister\\n, needs a new sword.\\nWhen she reaches the armory she spies \\nGendry\\n and asks him which one of the men is Lucan, he tells her that \\nHot\\nPie\\n asked him if he heard her scream \\nWinterfell\\n when they were fighting on the wall. Arya immediately claims she\\ndidn’t and Gendry tells her she did, but that he told Hot Pie he needs to clean out his ears because she yelled “Go to\\nhell” and she better have the same story; she does not want Hot Pie to know who she really is, and thinks maybe she\\nshould give Jaqen his name. Gendry gets Lucan, who pulls down a longsword and gives it to Arya with the message\\nthat it is too good for such an oaf. Arya claims she will pass on the message, but will not because Weese would beat\\nher bloody. The longsword feels good in Arya’s hand, although a lot heavier than \\nNeedle\\n, and she thinks that she\\nmay not be a \\nWater Dancer\\n but she is not a mouse either. She considers using the note to get a horse, pretending she\\nis doing it for Ser Lyonel since the stableboys are not able to read.\\nShe is trying to decide whether to take the chance when she overhears some archers talk. One says that Robb\\nbrought giants from the north, another that Starks are more like wolves than men, and then one states that Robb is\\nscared to attack Harrenhal, and would piss in his pants if he knew they were coming. One man comments that\\nmaybe they are the ones that should run. She thinks that yes, they should run or her brother will kill them. She is\\ninterrupted by Weese, who has come up in front of her and she did not see him. He complains that she took long\\nenough, and snatches the sword from her, slapping her with the back of his hand and telling her next time she will be\\nfaster. She was a wolf and suddenly is not. He asks her if she wants another slap, and tells her he wants none of her\\ninsolent looks, and to tell \\nTuffleberry\\n he has barrels for him but he needs to send lads to fetch them. He then warns\\nher to run if she wants to eat tonight, and not to get lost again or she will be beat bloody.\\n\\nHalfway to the brewhouse, she runs into \\nRorge\\n and three other of Ser Amory’s men. He calls her “Yoren’s little\\ncunt” and recalls that he promised to fuck her with her stick, saying she is no longer so brave now that he is not\\nwearing chains. When she tells him she is looking for Jaqen, she can see something in his eyes, possibly fear. He\\ntells her he is in the bathhouse and to get out of his way. In the bathhouse, she tries to sneak up on Jaqen, but he\\nknows she is there, telling her the scuff of leather on stone is as loud as warhorns to a man with open ears, and\\nclever girls go barefoot. She is upset that he heard her, and whispers Weese’s name in his ear. He states that a man\\nwill attend him at his leisure.\\nShe gives Tuffleberry the message and he curses, saying his lads are busy and that he will have those barrels within\\nan hour, or Lord Tywin will hear of it. Weese is not happy about this message, but finds six men.\\nSupper is a thin stew, and Weese shares his capon with a woman who has been sleeping with him. When he sees\\nArya staring, he reminds her he told her what would happen if he caught her staring. He slaps her, then shoves her\\nand her dress catches on a loose nail and rips. Weese commands her to fix that before she sleeps.\\nShe is kicked awake in the morning by Weese, who tells them that the work will not get easier now that Tywin’s\\nhost is gone. Later, Arya watches as Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan pass, followed by their great lords and captains.\\nLast comes \\nGregor Clegane\\n, with \\nPolliver\\n beside him wearing Gendry’s helmet. Suddenly Arya realizes she was\\nstupid and that neither \\nChiswyck\\n nor \\nWeese\\n mattered. Why didn’t she say Lord Tywin? She hurries to find Jaqen to\\ntell him.\\nShe hears a shriek of pain, and finds a dozen people looking at the body of Weese with his ugly dog on his chest.\\nEvery so often the dog rips a mouthful of flesh off his face. One man exclaims that he had that bitch since it was\\npup, and it must be \\nHarren’s\\n ghost. When Arya lifts her gaze, she sees Jaqen on the battlements, who casually lays\\ntwo fingers across his cheek.\\nNavigation:\\nArya VII\\n↑\\nTheon III\\n ←\\nArya VIII\\n→ \\nCatelyn V\\n↓\\nArya IX\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 39: Catelyn V\\nPlace(s): \\nRiverrun\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn IV\\n↑\\nArya VIII\\n ←\\nCatelyn V\\n→ \\nDaenerys III\\n↓\\nCatelyn VI\\nSynopsis\\nCatelyn\\n and her escort are nearing \\nRiverrun\\n and are met by \\nMartyn Rivers\\n and his outriders.

Catelyn is fearful\\nof her brother \\nEdmure\\'s\\n chances in battle against Lord Tywin, and outside Riverrun discovers \\nLannister men\\nhanging from the walls. Edmure informs her that four men from Ser \\nCleos\\'s\\n party attempted to free Ser \\nJaime\\n, and\\nnearly succeeded. They were hanged for their deeds, and the Kingslayer was placed in the deep dungeons and\\nchained to the wall. Her father\\'s steward, \\nUtherydes Wayn\\n, asks Catelyn if there is no hope of aid from the south,\\nhoping that \\nStannis Baratheon\\n will be forced to make common cause with them, but Catelyn gives no answer, since\\n\\'Stannis has made common cause with \\'\\na power greater and darker\\n\\'.\\nEdmure also explains that birds have arrived from \\nStorm\\'s End\\n, with messages from Ser \\nCortnay Penrose\\n seeking\\nhelp. Cortnay claimed he feared for the boy \\nEdric Storm\\n, \\nRobert\\'s\\n only known high-born bastard. Catelyn makes\\nknown her dissent in Edmure giving Lord Tywin battle. Her brother has commanded \\nRoose Bolton\\n to take\\nHarrenhal\\n, and has also called the levies from the \\nTwins\\n, those under the command of Ser \\nHelman Tallhart\\n.

Her khas warn her not to\\ntrust the Asshai’i shadowbinder, and Xaro concurs. Later, Ser \\nJorah\\n tells her she will find no help in \\nthis city\\n. He\\nexplains why Xaro wants to marry her: During a Qartheen wedding ceremony, the bride and groom each ask one\\nthing from each other that the other cannot refuse.

Davos states his respect for Ser Cortnay, who kept his faith, unlike all these new lords in Stannis’\\narmy. Stannis dislikes them as much, but he needs their strength in order to win his throne. Stannis sent Ser \\nParmen\\nCrane\\n to \\nBitterbridge\\n to gather the rest of Renly’s army, but there has been no word since. He tells Davos that he\\ngrieves for his brother Renly, and dreams of a green pavilion and the manner of Renly’s death, even though he was\\nin bed at the time of Renly’s demise. Stannis says, \"…but I did love him, Davos. I know that now.

He asks Melisandre if she is good or evil, and she\\nresponds, \"Oh, good. I am a \\nknight\\n of sorts myself. A champion of light and life.\" Davos calls her a liar, for she\\nmeans to kill a man this very night, as she killed \\nMaester Cressen\\n and Renly. The Red Woman responds that the\\nmaester poisoned himself, and that she had nothing to do with Renly’s death. However, she later admits that Renly\\nwas unprotected, while the walls of Storm’s End have spells woven into the stones, and that no shadow can pass\\nfrom the outside. When Davos proclaims that a shadow is a thing of darkness, Melisandre rebuffs him, stating that\\nshadows don’t exist in the dark, they are servants of light and fire, provided by her god, \\nR\\'hllor\\n.\\nWhen they arrive at a gate in a water tunnel beneath the castle, Melisandre disrobes, and Davos watches in horror as\\nthe now pregnant woman gives birth to a shadow, and Davos recognizes the man who cast it.\\nNavigation:\\nDavos I\\n↑\\nTyrion IX\\n ←\\nDavos II\\n→ \\nJon V\\n\\n↓\\nDavos III\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 43: Jon V\\nPlace(s): \\nFist of the First Men\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon IV\\n↑\\nDavos II\\n ←\\nJon V\\n→ \\nTyrion X\\n↓\\nJon VI\\nSynopsis\\nJon\\n hears the call of a warhorn, one blast to signify brothers returning. \\nQhorin Halfhand\\n has arrived, with 100 men\\nfrom the \\nShadow Tower\\n.

The men from the Shadow Tower were delayed because they met \\nAlfyn Crowkiller\\n and his men\\nwho had been scouting along \\nthe Wall\\n.

He does not want Lord Rosby hurt, nor any\\nkilling done in front of Tommen. For this, Ser Jacelyn will earn a lordship. Bronn offers to do the job instead if\\nthere\\'s a lordship in it for him, but Tyrion refuses, privately noting that Bywater\\'s men will defend Tommen whereas\\nBronn\\'s are more likely to sell Tommen to the crown\\'s enemies if the coming battle goes against them.\\nTyrion then sets out for \\nChataya\\n’s, but then abandons his patience and rides directly to \\nShae\\n’s mansion.

Tyrion bids Varys to wait at the stables while he talks to Shae.\\nOnce alone, Shae asks Tyrion to make her his lady in court, and even suggests he kill Cersei, but Tyrion tells her,\\n\"The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men.\"\\n When Tyrion proposes to take her\\nto the \\nRed Keep\\n and hide her in the kitchens, Shae balks, and mocks him for being afraid of \\nhis father\\n. Tyrion slaps\\nher in the face, telling her never to mock him again. Feeling remorseful, he tells her the story of \\nTysha\\n and his\\nfather’s wrath.

Varys recounts the story of how he came to be a eunuch: that he was a member of a mummers’ troupe, and that\\none day in \\nMyr\\n a certain man bought Varys from his master. The sorcerer castrated Varys, and burned the parts,\\ncreating a blue flame from which a voice spoke in a language he didn’t comprehend. Varys claims he has hated\\nmagic since that day, and means to see Stannis dead if the man practiced magic.\\nTyrion is somewhat skeptical, beliving it more likely that Stannis has hired a skilled assassin from the \\nFree Cities\\n,\\nmusing on how he used to dream of being rich enough one day to hire a \\nFaceless Man\\n to kill his sister.

Arya is confused, but has no time to ask him what he meant when\\nfighting breaks out in the great castle. Jaqen wipes blood from his sword on Arya’s shift, telling her this is her work.\\nLater, Arya takes back the name, and asks if she still can name a third, but Jaqen responds that she has gotten far\\nmore than three deaths. As she watches, Jaqen tells her the debt is paid and that he must die, and his features change\\nas he passes a hand over his face. Arya asks who he is and if she could learn to do the same, but Jaqen tells her she\\nwould need to go with him across the \\nnarrow sea\\n.

As the order is being carried out, he wonders whether \\nStygg\\n has reached\\nDeepwood Motte\\n yet, knowing that his sister \\nAsha\\n might be on her way to Winterfell by now. The people of\\nWinterfell are gathered in the yard. Theon angrily thinks that he tried to treat them justly, but that they have repaid\\nhim with betrayal.\\nUrzen and Black Lorren show Theon that \\nSquint\\n and \\nDrennan\\n, who had been guarding the Hunter’s Gate, have been\\nkilled. He recognizes Squint’s wounds as having been the work of the direwolves. He surmises that Drennan has\\nbeen killed by “the woman”, and realizes she must have had help from someone who freed the wolves. He thinks to\\nhimself that he should have killed the direwolves the day he took the castle. He decides to search for the wolves at\\ndaylight.\\nIn the yard, where \\nReek\\n informs him that six people are missing: Bran, Rickon, \\nMeera\\n and \\nJojen Reed\\n, \\nHodor\\n and\\nOsha\\n. Learning \\nDancer\\n is still in the stables, Theon realizes they escaped on foot, and that they would be slowed\\ndown by the fact that Bran would be in the basker on Hodor’s back and that Osha would need to carry Rickon.\\nTheon confronts the people of Winterfell, who do not answer his questions.\\nReek suggests skinning them, but Theon loudly declares there will be no flaying in the \\nnorth\\n while he rules\\nWinterfell, hoping some of the people at Winterfell will understand that he is the only thing protecting them from\\npeople like Reek.\\nTheon organizes a hunt on Bran and Rickon, ordering Maester Luwin to accompany them because he does not dare\\nto leave Luwin behind in the castle. Little Walder Frey asks to come too, which Theon allows. They leave the castle\\nwith eleven men, two boys, and twelve dogs. Reek takes a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack with\\nhim, but Theon does not inquire as to its contents. The tracks of the drivewolves, Hodor, and the two Reeds are\\neasily found and the dogs find the scent. They venture northwest, into the heart of the wolfswood. Theon considers\\n\\nthat they might be fleeing to Deepwood Motte, unaware that Asha will be occupying the castle. He bitterly thinks to\\nhimself that he’d sooner see them all dead, believing it is better to be seen as cruel than foolish.\\nMaester Luwin asks Theon to consider being merciful, not only to Bran and Rickon, but also the Reeds, citing their\\nvalue as a hostage against Lord \\nHowland Reed\\n. Theon agrees to spare them all, including Hodor, if he can, but not\\nOsha, who took an oath and broke it.\\nThey find the remains of a freshly killed young elk, clearly killed by the direwolves. Theon realizes that the animal\\nhas only been eaten off by the wolves, and that Osha has not even cut off a few steaks. He asks Farlen if the dogs\\ncould be tracking the wrong wolves, but Farlen denies the possibility.\\nThey continue, but the dogs lose the scent less than an hour later, at a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains.\\nThey are unable to determine where the wolves left the stream. Wex alerts them to the fact that there are only\\npawprints visible, but not the prints of men, meaning the wolves entered the water alone. Theon is horrified at the\\ndiscovery, realizing that Osha likely send the wolves ahead on their own. He sends Gariss, Murch, Aggar, and four\\ndogs to double back and find where the group must have parted from the wolves, while the others follow the\\ndirewolves, as they would not part from Bran and Rickon for long. He takes Wex, the Frey boy, and Gynir Rednose\\nwith him upstream. They search on both sides of the stream, but Theon feels forced to give up at midday, when they\\nstill have not found a sign of them. They reunite with Farlen’s search party, which had travelled downsteam, who\\nbare the same bad news. Gariss, Murch, and Aggar, having retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell, have not been\\nable to find any sign of the Starks either.\\nTheon does not dare to admit defeat and suggests returning to the brook again. Little Walder Frey believes they are\\nunable to find the Stark children because the Reeds are with them, citing numerous superstitions on “mudmen”. All\\nmen laugh at the notion, until Luwin cites how the histories say the crannogmen had once been close to the \\nchildren\\nof the forest\\n, suggesting they may have secret knowledge. Regardless, they return to the steam and search for many\\na mile, but when the last daylight fades, they are forced to abandon the search. Reek approaches Theon, suggesting\\nthat the Starks have travelled northeast, in the direction of the Umbers. However, Reek states, the children would\\nneed to shelter someplace closer by, and he might know where that is, mentioning the old mill on \\nAcorn Water\\n.\\nAlthough Theon questions why the Starks would have gone to hide there, with so many other possibilities nearby,\\nReek insists on the location. He shows Theon the contents of his sack, and when Theon finds the wolf’s-head\\nbrooch, he realizes what Reek is implying. He orders all but Aggar, Rednose, and Gelmarr to return to Winterfell.\\nLuwin asks him to remember his promice of mercy, but Theon replies that “mercy was for this morning”.\\nNavigation:\\nTheon III\\n↑\\nTyrion XI\\n ←\\nTheon IV\\n→ \\nJon VI\\n↓\\nTheon V\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 51: Jon VI\\nPlace(s): \\nSkirling Pass\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nJon V\\n↑\\nTheon IV\\n ←\\nJon VI\\n→ \\nSansa IV\\n↓\\nJon VII\\nSynopsis\\nAs \\nQhorin Halfhand\\n’s party moves through the \\nSkirling Pass\\n, they note watchers high up in the pass.

In the morning, the singer was gone along with Lord Brandon’s daughter.\\nA year later, the lord’s daughter was found in her bedchamber with a young baby. Bael had hidden her in the crypts\\nof Winterfell. Thirty years later when Bael was \\nKing-Beyond-the-Wall\\n and led the wildlings south, it was his son,\\nthe new Stark lord, who slew Bael, since the bard would not harm his son. Upon returning home, the young lord’s\\nmother killed herself when she found out Bael was dead. The young lord was said to have eventually been killed by\\none of his bannermen\\n.

She tells Brienne that she sent \\nthe Kingslayer\\n a bottle of \\nwine\\n to loosen\\nhis tongue. She means to question him, and is perhaps contemplating having the man killed since she has so little to\\nlive for anymore.\\nAt midnight, Catelyn goes to interrogate Jaime, and asks Brienne to wait outside. Jaime mocks her at first, but\\neventually agrees to answer her questions if she agrees to answer his. Jaime admits to being the father to all of\\nCersei\\n’s children, and to throwing \\nBran\\n out the tower window. However, Jaime denies sending the assassin after\\nBran, saying, \"if I wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.\" Catelyn questions him about the dagger\\nthat \\nLittlefinger\\n claimed \\nTyrion\\n had won from him. Jaime backs what Tyrion told her in the \\nMountains of the Moon\\n,\\nthat he always bets on his brother and lost at that tourney. Jaime admits that King \\nRobert\\n mocked him with the\\ndagger at the feast the night of the tourney, and Catelyn is dismayed that Littlefinger, who was like a brother to her\\nonce, would deceive her the way he has.\\nCatelyn then reveals that \\nRobb\\n has recently taken \\nthe Crag\\n from the \\nWesterlings\\n, and marched ever closer to\\nCasterly Rock\\n. Jaime then steers the conversation to what really happened to \\nBrandon Stark\\n and Lord \\nRickard\\n at the\\nhands of the Mad King \\nAerys\\n, perhaps to absolve himself of having slain the king. Brandon was on his way to\\nRiverrun when he learned of \\nLyanna\\n\\'s disappearance, and instead went to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n with a handful of friends,\\nall sons of prominent lords, and upon entering the \\nRed Keep\\n, Brandon shouted for \\nRhaegar\\n to \"come out and die\".\\nRhaegar was not there to answer the challenge, and Aerys had Brandon and his men arrested for conspiring to\\nmurder his heir. Aerys demanded the fathers of the men come to King’s Landing to answer the charges against their\\nsons; when they came, both fathers and sons were murdered at the command of King Aerys, with Brandon dying of\\nstrangulation trying to reach his father who was being burnt alive by Aerys\\' pyromancers.

Theon refuses to abandon his conquered seat, after which Asha leaves. As a last measure, Theon sends\\nReek away with a bag of coin in search of men to defend the castle. Afterwards he has yet another nightmare, which\\nmakes him realize all around him belongs to the Starks.\\nSynopsis\\nTheon Greyjoy\\n is woken from a nightmare, in which he is being chased by \\nlarge wolves\\n with the faces of children,\\nby his squire, \\nWex Pyke\\n, with \\nReek\\n standing behind him. Reek informs Theon that \\nAsha\\n has arrived. As Theon\\nprepares to see his sister, he thinks back about the nightmares he has been having lately, ever since the night he and\\nReek killed the two boys at the mill. After washing his face, Theon dresses in rich clothing, only to realize that Asha\\ncares more for blades. He changes again, this time dressing in felted black wool and ringmail. Lastly, he dons his\\ncrown.\\nTheon has taken to using guards for his own safety, while his own men have become sullen and anxious following\\nthe murders of \\nGelmarr\\n, \\nAggar\\n, and \\nGynir\\n. Although the three \\nironborn\\n had been killed by Reek with Theon\\'s\\npermission, to ensure they would not be able to reveal what had happened at the mill the night they returned with the\\ncorpses of the children, Theon had felt the need to blame someone for their deaths. To that end, he had executed\\nFarlen\\n, going as far as to personally execute him like \\nEddard Stark\\n would have done. The memory is a sour one, as it\\nhad taken him four difficult blows to sever Farlen\\'s head, afterward feeling sick about it.\\nHis men would prefer to leave \\nWinterfell\\n, a thought that makes Theon angry. He refuses to be driven from his own\\nseat, being the Prince of Winterfell. He blames Asha, feeling she had taken this long to respond to his commands on\\npurpose. Reek, \\nUrzen\\n and \\nKromm\\n escort Theon to the hall, where he finds Asha in the high seat of the \\nStarks\\n. Theon\\nis dismayed to discover that Asha brought only twenty men. In turn, she scolds him for having killed \\nBran\\n and\\nRickon Stark\\n and having mounted their heads upon Winterfell\\'s gates. The memory of returning the bodies to\\nWinterfell is a sour one for Theon as well. He recalls forbidding \\nLuwin\\n from sewing the heads back onto the bodies\\nand placing them in the \\ncrypts of Winterfell\\n. Theon leads Asha to Eddard Stark\\'s solar, where he tells her that\\nDagmer\\n has lost the fight at \\nTorrhen\\'s Square\\n. Asha tells him she was not surprised to learn about it, and informs\\nhim that Dagmer is currently leading the survivors back to the \\nStony Shore\\n, making Theon realize that she is better\\ninformed than he is.\\nTheon is furious about the fact that Asha is planning on leaving only ten of her men behind for him. \\nLeobald\\nTallhart\\n has joined Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n, Lord \\nWyman Manderly\\n has sent a dozen barges upriver, and \\nthe Umbers\\n are\\ngathering beyond the \\nLast River\\n. Asha compliments her brother for the clever way he took Winterfell, but tells him\\nthat the wise course of action would have been razing the castle and taking the two princes as hostages back to \\nPyke\\n.\\nWinterfell is too far from the sea, and every northman is now his enemy. Theon counters her, telling her that he\\nkilled two of Eddard Stark\\'s sons to lay to rest the ghosts of their brothers, \\nRodrik\\n and \\nMaron\\n. Asha tells him that\\nRodrik might feel the need to avenge Eddard\\'s sons and asks Theon to return with her to \\nDeepwood Motte\\n. When\\nTheon refuses, Asha leaves, telling him he shall hold the castle for the remainder of his life.\\n\\nAsha departs the castle with her men and Theon watches her go from atop the wall, where he is approached by Reek.\\nReek offers to find Theon two hundred good men if Theon provides a horse and a bag of coin. He asks for \\nPalla\\n as a\\nreward. Although Reek makes Theon uneasy, he does not dare kill the man, as he is literate and cunning, and could\\neasily have left a hidden account of what they had done behind. Theon agrees to give him the girl if he can deliver\\ntwo hundred men, and Reek leaves the castle before the sun goes down. That night Theon dreams about the\\nwelcoming feast Eddard Stark had thrown King \\nRobert I Baratheon\\n when the king visited Winterfell. Although the\\nfeast is jolly at first, the room grows darker and suddenly Theon finds himself dining with the dead. Robert\\'s guts are\\nspilling out on the table from a great gash in his belly, while Eddard Stark is headless. Lining the benches below are\\nthe corpses of men he knows: \\nJory Cassel\\n, \\nFat Tom\\n, \\nPorther\\n, \\nCayn\\n, \\nHullen\\n, and all the others who had gone south to\\nKing\\'s Landing\\n. \\nMikken\\n, \\nChayle\\n, \\nBenfred Tallhart\\n and his \\nWild Hares\\n, the miller\\'s wife, \\nFarlen\\n, and the \\nwildling\\nTheon had killed to rescue Bran are among them. There are also people who Theon has never met, including\\nRickard\\n, \\nLyanna\\n, and \\nBrandon Stark\\n. Then, \\nRobb Stark\\n enters through the doors with \\nGrey Wind\\n beside him, both\\nof them bleeding \"from half a hundred savage wounds\".\\nTheon wakes screaming, and Wex and his guards fetch Luwin, but Theon does not dare drink the sleeping draught\\nthat the \\nmaester\\n leaves him. Instead, he summons \\nKyra\\n and fucks her, but even that cannot help him sleep again, and\\nshe leaves sobbing of pain. At dawn, Theon goes outside. Seeing everything belonging to the Starks around him, he\\nthinks to himself he should have gone with Asha. In silence, he looks at the heads mounted atop the iron spikes of\\nthe gatehouse, reflecting on what fools people could be. Although everyone had accepted his story, the heads on the\\nwall actually belong to the miller\\'s sons, who had been of an age and coloring with the two missing Starks. With\\ntheir faces flayed, no one had been able to tell the difference.

As the mass of ships and debris begin to float back out towards the bay and Davos hopes he can\\nreach the open sea, he sees the great chain boom raised closing off the Blackwater Rush, turning its mouth into the\\nmouth of hell.\\nNavigation:\\nDavos II\\n↑\\nSansa V\\n ←\\nDavos III\\n→ \\nTyrion XIII\\n↓\\nA Storm of Swords\\nDavos I\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 59: Tyrion XIII\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion XII\\n↑\\nDavos III\\n ←\\nTyrion XIII\\n→ \\nSansa VI\\n↓\\nTyrion XIV\\nTyrion Lannister\\n watches as half of \\nStannis\\n\\' fleet is on fire in the \\nBlackwater Rush\\n. Hundreds of people are dying in\\nthe water. \\nKing Joffrey\\n complains that most of his ships are ablaze, but for Tyrion there is no alternative to\\nsacrificing them. Some of Stannis\\' ships have escaped, however, releasing men in front of the city wall or waiting on\\nthe southern shore of the Blackwater. Tyrion allows Joffrey to launch the \\nAntler Men\\n with the \\ncatapults\\n into the\\nfray. He gets word that there is a large force attempting to batter down the \\nKing\\'s Gate\\n. When he arrives there, he\\norders \\nthe Hound\\n, who is in command, to go out with his men, but Clegane refuses. Tyrion realizes that the man is\\nafraid of the wildfire and he is forced to rally the troops himself, leading a sortie through the gate to stop Stannis\\'\\nmen.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion Lannister\\n, standing on top of the \\nMud Gate\\n, watches motionlessly as half of \\nStannis\\'\\n fleet is ablaze in the\\nBlackwater Rush\\n, along with most of \\nKing Joffrey\\'s\\n ships. It seems like the river itself is on fire. The air is full of\\nsmoke, arrows and screams. The wildfire is drifting downstream towards ships that desperately, but futilely, try to\\nescape. The low-hanging clouds reflect the green glow, creating an eerily beautiful scenery. Tyrion is reminded of\\ndragon fire and wonders whether he feels the same way as \\nAegon the Conqueror\\n did when he watched the \\nField of\\nFire\\n. He is captivated and can\\'t turn away, although he realizes that this is only half a victory and that the\\ncelebrations of the \\nGold Cloaks\\n behind him are premature.\\nTyrion sees another ship loaded with wildfire exploding and has to shield his eyes. Hundreds of people are dying in\\nthe water, either burning to death or drowning. He thinks of Stannis, who might be sitting on his warhorse among\\nthe mass of people on the southern bank of the Blackwater, watching the same spectacle. Tyrion hears King Joffrey,\\nhuddled among his guards on the wallwalk below, complaining about the fate of his fleet, as the \\nKingslander\\n, \\nQueen\\nCersei\\n and \\nLoyal Man\\n are already burning and the \\nSeaflower\\n is about to be engulfed by flames as well. He advises\\nhis nephew that there was no alternative to sacrificing the own fleet, thinking by himself that Stannis would have\\nsensed the trap, if the royal fleet had not come forward for battle. \\nBronn\\n\\'s position under the \\nRed Keep\\n is too far\\naway for Tyrion to see anything, but the sellsword must have set the oxen into motion the second Stannis\\' flagship\\nhad passed and the enormously heavy chain was pulled up by the winches, creating a barrier that now prevents most\\nships from escaping the wildfire inferno.\\nSome do, though, as Tyrion observes with dismay. While the main channel of the Blackwater is all aflame, the north\\nand south banks are not, as the wildfire has not spread as evenly Tyrion hoped it would. A good part of Stannis\\'\\nships have made for the southern side of the Blackwater, from where they can bring the enemy troops across later\\non, while at least eight ships have already landed under the city wall, putting men ashore there. Stannis\\' main host\\nmight need some time to regain their courage after watching the jade holocaust that has absorbed so many of their\\nfellows, but when they start to attack again, the risk of the city forces breaking will be acute, as Lord \\nJacelyn\\nBywater\\n has warned Tyrion. Seeing shapes moving among the charred ruins of the city wharves, he sends order to\\nLord Jacelyn to make another sortie against soldiers stumbling ashore.\\nHe also commands Ser \\nArneld\\n to swing the \\nThree Whores\\n thirty degrees west. King Joffrey brings up that his\\nmother has promised him that he could use the catapults and Tyrion allows him to go through with his plan for the\\nAntler Men\\n. When they were brought before the King for justice, Joffrey promised them that he would send them\\n\\nback to Stannis. The traitors are now naked and trussed up in the square, antlers nailed to their heads, and Joffrey\\nintends to catapult the bodies over the city wall in Stannis\\' direction. Tyrion tells Joffrey to proceed swiftly, as the\\nGreat Whores will be needed for other things soon. As the happy King is about to leave, escorted by members of the\\nKingsguard\\n, Tyrion orders Ser \\nOsmund Kettleblack\\n that they should keep Joffrey safe under any circumstance but\\nalso keep him among the defenders. He wonders whether \\nCersei\\n will be true to her promise of protecting \\nAlayaya\\nthe way he protects Cersei\\'s wretched bastard son.\\nTyrion gets word that hundreds of enemies have landed on the tourney grounds and prepare for battering down the\\nKing\\'s Gate\\n with a ram. He curses, hurries to his horse and, followed by \\nPodrick Payne\\n and Ser \\nMandon Moore\\n,\\ngallops through the \\nRiver Row\\n, kept clear of traffic on Tyrion\\'s command to allow movement between the gates,\\ntowards the King\\'s Gate. When he arrives there, the ram is already in place outside and crashing against the wood.\\nSome of the defenders on the gatehouse square are wounded, but Tyrion spots a good many sellswords and knights\\nwho are not, and he orders another sortie, asking who is in charge.\\nSandor Clegane\\n steps forward and objects to Tyrion\\'s order, dropping his helmet to the ground. His face is covered\\nin blood from a gash on his forehead and his left ear is sheared off. Tyrion insists on a sortie, but the Hound tells\\nhim to bugger that and bugger himself. A sellsword seconds Clegane, explaining that three sorties left half of the\\nmen wounded or dead. Tyrion sarcastically asks him whether he thinks he has been hired to fight in a tourney. He\\nrepeats his order, addressing the Hound in particular, but then is shocked to notice that Clegane is actually scared.\\nHe changes his tactics and tries to coax the men into action, but Clegane is adamant that he will not lead the men\\ninto the fire again. He suggests to open the gate instead and kill the enemies when they rush inside. Ser Mandon\\nadvises him to obey the order of the \\nHand of the King\\n, but the Hound just curses Tyrion some more, then asks for\\nwine.\\nClegane\\'s face is white as milk and Tyrion thinks he\\'s dead on feet, worn out by the battle and his terror of fire. Even\\nworse, the Hound\\'s fear has shaken the will of those he commands. Tyrion is looking around for another man to put\\nin charge, but dimisses his own idea of using Ser Mandon, as he remembers a comment by his brother \\nJaime\\n that Ser\\nMandon is not the kind of man others would follow. He hears another crash of the ram and announces that he will\\nlead the sortie himself, thinking to himself that this is madness but madness is better than defeat. The Hound laughs\\nat the suggestion with contempt, but Tyrion gives orders to prepare the attack. However, only twenty men respond to\\nhis call while the others follow Clegane\\'s example. Sitting on his horse with helmet and shield, Tyrion addresses the\\nholdouts: \"They say I\\'m only half a man. What does that make the lot of you?\"\\nHe manages to shame them by suggesting they are less than a dwarf if they refuse to fight the enemies. Within a few\\nmoments, twice as many men respond to Tyrion\\'s orders. He announces:\\n\"You won’t hear me shout out Joffrey’s name. [...] You won’t hear me yell for \\nCasterly Rock\\n either. This is\\nyour city Stannis means to sack, and that’s your gate he’s bringing down. So come with me and kill the son of a\\nbitch!\"\\nTyrion unshields his axe and trots towards the sally point. He thinks the men are following him, but he doesn\\'t dare\\nto look around and check whether they really do.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion XII\\n↑\\nDavos III\\n ←\\nTyrion XIII\\n→ \\nSansa VI\\n↓\\nTyrion XIV\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 60: Sansa V\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nSansa VI\\n↑\\nTyrion XIII\\n ←\\nSansa V\\n→ \\nTyrion XIV\\n↓\\nSansa VII\\nSynopsis\\nCersei\\n continues to receive word on the progress of \\nthe battle\\n from one of the \\nKettleblacks\\n.

She is brought before her son to explain why she released \\nJaime\\nLannister\\n. \\nRickard Karstark\\n, whose sons \\nEddard\\n and \\nTorrhen\\n were killed by Jaime, is angry at her but Robb is more\\ngentle and acknowledges that \"love is not always wise\". Thinking about her daughters whom she had hoped to trade\\nfor Ser Jaime, Catelyn agrees. Lord Karstark, however, is unappeased and leaves the room in a fury.\\nIn privacy, Robb introduces his mother to his new bride. Catelyn immediately realizes that, as Robb was pledged to\\nmarry a Frey, he has insulted the Freys and broken the alliance. But with his \"love is not always wise\" speech Robb\\nhas made it impossible to blame him, as Catelyn disobeyed him because of her love for her daughters.\\nRobb tells her how he met his wife. He had taken a wound storming \\nthe Crag\\n, and \\nJeyne\\n nursed him back to health.\\nThe night he was told his brothers were murdered, Jeyne consoled him and they slept together. Robb married her the\\nnext morning. As the \\nWesterings\\n were vassals of \\nHouse Lannister\\n, Jeyne has taken her family with her to escape the\\nrevenge of the Lannisters. Catelyn notices that \\nGrey Wind\\n is not with her son, because Jeyne is afraid of the wolf,\\nand the beast growls whenever her uncle, \\nRolph Spicer\\n, is near. Catelyn does not like that and convinces him to send\\nSer Rolph off on some errand, for Grey Wind should always be near him. She considers what it may take to appease\\nLord \\nWalder Frey\\n after this slight. The loss of the Freys is strongly felt by Robb, and there was nothing that could be\\ndone when \\nRyman\\n and \\nBlack Walder\\n led their men back to \\nthe Twins\\n.\\nEdmure tells \\nhis uncle\\n about his victory against the Lannisters but the latter interrupts him and both the Blackfish\\nand Robb berate Edmure for his actions. Edmure was told to not to engage the Lannisters because Robb wanted\\nthem to come West. His plan was to hold them there so that the Lannisters would be unable to defend \\nKing\\'s\\nLanding\\n against \\nStannis Baratheon\\n\\'s invasion. Edmure\\'s attack delayed \\nTywin Lannister\\n long enough for messengers\\nto reach him, allowing the Lannister host to turn around, link up with \\nMace Tyrell\\n\\'s army and arrive at King\\'s\\nLanding to turn the tide at the \\nBattle of the Blackwater\\n.

He adjourns the meeting, asking Tyrion, \\nCersei\\nand Kevan to stay. Tyrion warns them not to trust Littlefinger with this quest to the Vale, but Tywin is resolute,\\nbelieving it better to have Baelish ruling the Vale as opposed to the likes of \\nYohn Royce\\n or \\nLyn Corbray\\n and adds\\nthat Littlefinger has proven his loyalty, telling Tyrion that just the other day Baelish informed them of a plot by the\\nTyrells to bring \\nSansa\\n to Highgarden and marry her to \\nWillas\\n. The Hand is aware that should Mace Tyrell ask leave\\nto bring Sansa to Highgarden, they must consent or else offend the Tyrells. Tywin wishes to circumvent this\\nproblem by offering Cersei\\'s hand in marriage to Willas. Cersei adamantly refuses but her father has the final say,\\nand Cersei storms out of the room in a fury. Tywin then tells Tyrion that he will wed Sansa Stark, further solidifying\\nthe Lannisters\\'s position, because should \\nRobb\\n die and Sansa and Tyrion have a son, the child will become Lord of\\nWinterfell\\n.\\nTyrion protests, arguing that a marriage to Sansa is worthless while the Greyjoys hold the north and questions why\\nhe isn\\'t being forced into a marriage with Balon\\'s \\ndaughter\\n, but Tywin counters that the \\nironborn\\n won\\'t rule the\\nnorth, they will just plunder it, uniting the northmen against them, which the Lannisters can use to retake the north\\nwhen Tyrion brings Ned Stark\\'s grandson home to claim his birthright. Tyrion argues again, protesting that Sansa is\\nstill a child, but Tywin retorts with Cersei\\'s testimony the girl has flowered. Tyrion suggests sending the girl back to\\nher mother\\n as a gesture of goodwill that might make Robb Stark bend the knee, but Tywin coldly retorts that if they\\n\\ndo that, Sansa will be married off to one of the northern or Riverlords to shore up her brother\\'s alliances. Tywin adds\\nthat this marriage is a reward for Tyrion\\'s previous service and threatens that if Tyrion won\\'t go through with it, they\\nwill marry Sansa off to Lancel or another of his cousins and find Tyrion another bride; the threat of being married to\\nLollys Stokeworth\\n, as well as the prospect of being made Lord of Winterfell if he is to be denied \\nCasterly Rock\\n is\\nenough to cow Tyrion.\\nAs a last attempt at protest, Tyrion argues that any claim Sansa might have to Winterfell will be made irrelevant\\nwhen her brother gets a child from whichever Frey girl he marries, and learns to his surprise that Robb Stark has\\nbroken his pledge with the \\nFreys\\n and married \\nJeyne Westerling\\n. Ser Kevan reveals that \\nLord Westerling\\n\\'s \\nwife\\n is a\\nSpicer, a house of extremely low birth having descended from traders.

After the \\nTrident\\n, Aerys sent \\nhis\\nwife\\n and Prince \\nViserys\\n to \\nDragonstone\\n, but kept \\nElia\\n and her children in the \\nRed Keep\\n because he thought that\\nPrince \\nLewyn Martell\\n had betrayed Rhaegar during the battle, and thus needed Elia and the children as hostages to\\nensure \\nDorne\\n\\'s loyalty. With the wildfire in place, Aerys told Rossart, \"The traitors want my city, but I’ll give them\\nnaught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat.\" Aerys may have thought that the great\\nfire would kill everyone, but transform him into a dragon, much as \\nAerion Brightflame\\n had thought.

Bolton tells them he awarded\\nHarrenhal to \\nVargo Hoat\\n because the goat was a stranger to the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n and did not know ‘the prize was\\npoisoned’. He means the curse of Lord Tywin, for Hoat was not aware of what Tywin does to traitors such as the\\nTarbecks\\n and the \\nReynes\\n.

The end of the \\nwar\\n is within reach and \\nLord Tywin\\nintends to be generous to \\nStark\\n allies, but Joffrey wants all traitors executed and accuses his grandfather of\\ncowardice during \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n. Tywin orders Joffrey to be escorted to his bedchamber, and Cersei leaves after\\nan unsuccessful attempt to defend him. On the Dornish issue, Tywin reveals that he will not sacrifice \\nGregor\\nClegane\\n to the \\nMartells\\n. Tyrion is shocked, and Tywin explains his rationale at the time of the \\nSack of King’s\\nLanding\\n and the murder of \\nElia Martell\\n and her children. He also reveals that \\nArya Stark\\n is still alive.\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n and \\nSansa\\n spend a joyless meal together, with both not talking much. Sansa takes a joke Tyrion makes about\\nthe quality of the food as him criticizing her, but he assures her that it\\'s not her fault and that he has more serious\\nmatters to worry about. Besides \\nJoffrey\\n, \\nCersei\\n and \\nhis father\\n, what bothers him most are the 300 Dornishmen\\nvisiting for the King\\'s wedding. He has settled them in a cornerfort of the \\nRed Keep\\n, as far away from the \\nTyrells\\n as\\npossible, yet there has already been a brawl between Tyrell and \\nGargalen\\n soldiers at \\nFlea Bottom\\n, leaving one dead,\\nand a confrontation in the yard where \\nOlenna Redwyne\\n called \\nEllaria Sand\\n \"the serpent\\'s whore\", while \\nOberyn\\nMartell\\n keeps asking for justice concerning the death of his sister \\nElia\\n and her children every time he sees Tyrion.\\nHowever, Tyrion sees no point in bothering his already troubled young wife with any of this. After the meal, Sansa\\nasks for leave for her nightly visit to the \\ngodswood\\n. Although Tyrion finds Sansa\\'s piety excessive, he allows it,\\neven offering to accompany her some time. She immediately objects to this, telling him he would be bored, as\\npraying to the \\nold gods\\n is mainly done in silence and without adornments. She knows him better than he imagined,\\nhe thinks. He is tempted to ask what she prays for, but is afraid of what the answer would be.\\nHe gets back to his tedious tasks as \\nMaster of Coin\\n, trying to make sense of some of the complicated numbers in the\\nledgers \\nPetyr Baelish\\n left him. He considers some of Littlefinger\\'s investments highly suspicious. Tyrion now regrets\\nthat he consented so easily to the execution of the \\nAntler Men\\n, as he has since learned that some of them owed the\\nCrown large sums and suspects that having \\nBronn\\n try locating their heirs will be a futile effort. Ser \\nBoros Blount\\narrives, delivering a summons from Lord Tywin. Tyrion is glad to leave the books. Outside, rain is in the air, making\\nTyrion concerned Sansa will get soaked at the godswood.\\nWhen he arrives at the \\nHand’s solar\\n, he finds King Joffrey, Queen Regent Cersei, Ser \\nKevan\\n and Grand Maester\\nPycelle\\n there as well, besides his father. Joffrey is obviously elated, Cersei smiles smugly, yet Lord Tywin is his\\nusual grim self and Tyrion wonders whether his father can smile at all. Tyrion asks what has happened and is shown\\na roll of parchment. The message reads: \"\\nRoslin\\n caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for\\nher wedding.\" Checking the seal, Tyrion realizes that the message comes from \\nThe Twins\\n. He asks whether Lord\\nWalder Frey\\n thinks he is being poetic. He realizes that \"trout\" refers to \\nEdmure Tully\\n, but before he can speculate on\\nthe meaning of the \"pair of wolf pelts\", Joffrey announces that the message implies that \\nRobb Stark\\n is dead.\\nTyrion\\'s thoughts immediately drift to his wife, probably praying this very moment to her \\nfather\\'s\\n gods, for her\\nbrother\\'s victory and her \\nmother\\'s\\n safety. It seems that neither the Old nor the \\nNew Gods\\n are listening to prayer,\\nTyrion thinks, wondering whether this should give him some comfort. He makes a glib comment about the kings\\nfalling like leaves this autumn and their little war winning itself, prompting a poisonly sweet reply by Cersei that it\\'s\\nin fact Lord Tywin who won the war. Lord Tywin doesn\\'t consider the war over as long as enemies are in the field,\\n\\nyet Cersei is optimistic that the lords of the \\nRiverlands\\n, confronted with the combined powers of \\nHighgarden\\n,\\nCasterly Rock\\n and \\nDorne\\n without the northmen to support them, will choose submission over destruction now. Lord\\nTywin agrees that most will, except for \\nRiverrun\\n and probably \\nSeagard\\n and \\nRaventree Hall\\n. However, \\nBrynden\\nTully\\n won\\'t dare to become a threat as long as Lord Frey keeps his nephew Edmure as hostage, and the \\nFreys\\n can\\nkeep \\nJason Mallister\\n penned up at his seat while \\nJonos Bracken\\n might be bribed to change allegiance and attack the\\nBlackwoods\\n. In the end, everyone will bend their knees, Tywin predicts, and he is ready to offer generous terms. He\\nis going to spare every castle except one. Tyrion assumes that the exception will be \\nHarrenhal\\n, which Lord Tywin\\nconfirms, announcing that he has already commanded Ser \\nGregor Clegane\\n to attack the castle and rid the realm of\\nthe \\nBrave Companions\\n. Tyrion is amused about his father exploiting the Mountain before he will be handed over to\\nthe \\nMartells\\n, yet the prospect of Littlefinger soon being able to take his seat at Harrenhal doesn\\'t please him. He\\nwonders whether Lord Baelish has already arrived at the \\nVale\\n, wishing his ship sank instead.\\nKing Joffrey doesn\\'t agree with generous terms, insisting that all traitors should be executed instead. He wants Lord\\nWalder to send him Robb Stark\\'s head, so that he can serve it to Sansa at his wedding feast. Ser Kevan is shocked\\nand reminds him that Sansa is now his aunt by marriage. Cersei tries to dismiss his statement, calling it a jest, yet\\nJoffrey insists. Tyrion angrily tells Joffrey that he can\\'t torture Sansa any longer, calling him a monster, to which\\nJoffrey replies that Tyrion is the true monster. Tyrion counters that Joffrey should be concerned then, as monsters\\nare dangerous and kings are dying like flies already. Joffrey and Cersei are furious about Tyrion\\'s threat, but Lord\\nTywin scolds Joffrey instead, advising him that a king who feels the need to remind people of his power is no true\\nking. \\nKing Aerys\\n never understood that, Lord Tywin says, as proven by his habit of having the tongues of people\\nlike Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n ripped out, but Joffrey will. It\\'s necessary to fight your enemies, but if they yield, generosity is\\nthe right approach. Lord Tywin closes by telling Joffrey that the only head he should be concerned with right now is\\nMargaery Tyrell\\n\\'s maidenhead.\\nJoffrey is sullen, then surprises everyone in the room by defying Lord Tywin, accusing him of having been afraid of\\nKing Aerys. Tyrion thinks that things just got interesting. Cersei demands that Joffrey apologize to his grandfather,\\nyet he goes on, recounting how it was \\nRobert Baratheon\\n who fought \\nPrince Rhaegar\\n and won the crown while Lord\\nTywin hid at Casterly Rock. A strong king acts boldly, he states. Lord Tywin is not amused, thanking the King\\ncoldly for sharing his wisdom. He asks Ser Kevan to escort Joffrey to his bedchamber and Pycelle to give him some\\ndreamwine, completely ignoring Joffrey\\'s protest. As Ser Kevan firmly guides Joffrey out and Pycelle follows,\\nTyrion and Cersei remain, on their father\\'s order. Cersei tries to apologize for Joffrey\\'s behavior, calling him willful.\\nLord Tywin thinks Joffrey is more stupid than willful and asks who put the idea into the boy\\'s head that strong kings\\nact boldly. Cersei suggests it was Robert. Tyrion, glad to bring up that comment again, confirms that the part about\\nTywin hiding in Casterly Rock sounded like something Robert would say. Cersei tries to play into this, but Lord\\nTywin is upset that he might have fought a war to seat \"Robert the Second\" on the \\nIron Throne\\n when Cersei has\\nbeen assuring him that the boy cared nothing for his father. He doesn\\'t, Cersei insists, recounting how Robert cared\\nnothing for his son, would have beaten the boy if he could and hit him so hard once that Joffrey lost two teeth,\\ncausing her to threaten Robert to kill him if he hit him again. Lord Tywin tells his daughter to leave, which she does\\nseethingly. Tyrion proposes that, rather than following his father\\'s footsteps, Joffrey will become \"\\nAerys\\n the Third\".\\nLord Tywin responds that he is only thirteen and still has time to grow, yet Tyrion notices that his father is more\\nupset than he wants to show. Lord Tywin announces that Joffrey needs a hard lesson, reminding Tyrion of the \\nhard\\nlesson his father gave him when he was the same age\\n, which almost makes him feel sorry for Joffrey. However,\\nTyrion can\\'t think of anyone who\\'d deserve it more than Joffrey.\\nTyrion gets back to the business of war. He congratulates his father, asking him how long he had been plotting with\\nLord Walder. Lord Tywin objects to his son\\'s choice of words. Tyrion retorts that he doesn\\'t enjoy being left in the\\ndark. His father explains that nobody was told who didn\\'t play a part in the execution, including Cersei, stressing\\nhow important it is to keep secrets, especially in \\nKing’s Landing\\n. He wanted to get rid of a dangerous enemy as\\ncheaply as possible and that has been achieved, he announces, also suggesting that, while Tyrion has some talent for\\ncunning, he simply talks too much and his loose tongue will be his undoing one day. Tyrion jests that he should have\\nlet Joffrey rip his tongue out then and Lord Tywin says he shouldn\\'t tempt him.\\nThe discussion moves on to the Dornish issue. Lord Tywin considers the presence of \\nOberyn Martell\\n unfortunate,\\ndescribing him as half-mad while he believes \\nDoran Martell\\n to be a reasoned man who weighs the consequences of\\nwords and actions. Tyrion asks whether it is true that Oberyn tried to continue \\nthe war\\n on behalf of \\nViserys\\nTargaryen\\n. Lord Tywin confirms it, recounting how \\nJon Arryn\\n\\'s negotiations with Prince Doran in \\nSunspear\\n put an\\n\\nend to the conspiracy with both sides deciding to remain silent about the issue afterwards, but distrust between King\\nRobert and House Martell remained. Tyrion proposes that showing Oberyn around in the brothels of the city could\\nease the Red Viper\\'s impatience, jesting that he won\\'t be accused of not serving House Lannister where he is needed\\nmost. Lord Tywin finds this comment very droll and asks whether Tyrion wants motley to be sewn for him,\\nprompting Tyrion\\'s question as to whether he would be allowed to say anything he wants about King Joffrey if he\\nwore it. Lord Tywin declares that, while he had to suffer \\nhis father\\'s\\n follies, he won\\'t suffer his son\\'s.\\nTyrion is more serious now, predicting that Oberyn will not be pleasant, nor satisfied with only receiving Gregor\\nClegane\\'s head. Lord Tywin reveals that he has no intention of sacrificing the Mountain, as he has served House\\nLannister well and nobody is dreaded as much by their enemies. Tyrion is shocked; he thought that he and his father\\nagreed that the woods are full of beasts and that even Ser Gregor is disposable. He points out that Oberyn knows it\\nwas the Mountain who killed his sister and her children. Oberyn knows nothing and has no proof, Lord Tywin\\nreplies, he merely heard rumors and Ser Gregor is not likely to confirm them, in particular as Tywin will keep him\\naway for as long as the Dornishmen are in the city. If Oberyn raises the issue, Lord Tywin will claim the murderer\\nwas Ser \\nAmory Lorch\\n – and the tale of Ser Amory\\'s gruesome death by the hands of a bear set on him by \\nVargo\\nHoat\\n would even appease Oberyn, he expects. Tyrion objects to his father\\'s sense of justice, but Tywin tells him that\\nit was in fact Ser Amory who found and killed Rhaegar\\'s daughter \\nRhaenys\\n, also revealing that the child\\'s mother\\nand baby brother \\nAegon\\n were in the nursery below at the time. When Tyrion asks what he is going to tell Oberyn if\\nhe inquires who gave the order for the murders, Lord Tywin answers that Ser Amory acted on his own in an attempt\\nto win the favor of the new king, as Robert\\'s hatred of Rhaegar was well known. Thinking about it, Tyrion has to\\nconcede that this version might serve its purpose, although he suspects that the Red Viper will not be happy.\\nTyrion\\'s suggestion that it would have been better for his father to let Robert commit the murders himself prompts\\nan astonished Lord Tywin to share his reasoning at the time of the \\nSack of King’s Landing\\n. He explains that they\\ncame late to Robert’s cause, so they had to demonstrate their loyalty. When Tywin laid the bodies at the throne, it\\nwas clear they had forsaken House Targaryen, and Robert was clearly relieved, knowing that Rhaegar’s children had\\nto die for his throne to be secure, but not wanting to kill them himself. Tywin admits that it was done too brutally,\\nand Elia did not need to be harmed. The Mountain only killed her because Tywin did not tell him to spare her.\\nTywin asserts that at the time, he had greater concerns than the Dornish princess; Ned Stark’s van was rushing south\\nfrom \\nthe Trident\\n, and Tywin feared coming to battle with him, as well as the possibility of Aerys murdering \\nJaime\\npurely out of spite. \"That, and what Jaime himself might do.\" He also did not know what Gregor Clegane was\\ncapable of, only that he was huge and terrible in battle. He did not command Clegane to rape Elia, and Ser Amory\\nwas almost as bestial with Rhaenys. When Tywin asked Ser Armory why it had required fifty thrusts to kill a girl of\\ntwo or three, he claimed she’d kicked him and would not stop screaming. He states that if Lorch had had any wits,\\nhe would have calmed her with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow.\\nTyrion asks whether it was a soft sweet pillow that killed Robb Stark. Lord Tywin reveals that the plan was to kill\\nRobb at his uncle\\'s wedding with an arrow, as he was too circumspect in the field. Tyrion inquires about the fate of\\nRobb\\'s mother. Lord Tywin suspects that the reference to \"a pair of wolf pelts\" in Lord Walder\\'s message implies\\nthat Lady Catelyn is dead, too. The original idea was to keep her as captive, but maybe something went wrong, he\\nsuggests. Tyrion points out that the sacred guest right has been violated. Lord Tywin replies: \"The blood is on\\nWalder Frey’s hands, not mine.\" Tyrion, describing him as an ill-natured old lecher who nourishes the slights he has\\nsuffered over his long life, says he has no doubt that Lord Walder has planned the whole thing, yet he would never\\nhave dared to go through with it if he hadn\\'t been given the promise of protection. Tywin counters that refusing him\\nwould have meant keeping him loyal to Robb Stark and prolonging the war. He considers the price that was paid\\nlow: The Crown will grant Riverrun to \\nEmmon Frey\\n as soon as the Blackfish yields, while \\nLancel\\n and \\nDaven\\nLannister\\n have to marry Frey girls and \\nGerion Lannister\\n\\'s bastard daughter \\nJoy\\n will be wedded to one of Lord\\nWalder\\'s natural sons, once she is old enough. \\nRoose Bolton\\n becomes \\nWarden of the North\\n and his \\nbastard son\\n will\\nmarry \\nArya Stark\\n.\\nThe revelation that Lord Bolton was involved in the conspiracy is not particularly surprising to Tyrion, as Lord\\nWalder probably had not the stomach to act alone. However, he is baffled about the role assigned to Arya and points\\nout that neither \\nVarys\\n nor Ser \\nJacelyn Bywater\\n were able to locate the girl, thus he is sure she is dead. Lord Tywin\\nreplies: \"So was \\nRenly\\n, until the \\nBlackwater\\n.\" Tyrion doesn\\'t understand what this means. Lord Tywin replies that\\nLittlefinger might have succeeded where Tyrion and Varys failed. He suggests that the Boltons shall be fighting the\\nIronborn\\n for a few years while the Crown will keep an eye on their efforts to subjugate the Starks\\' other bannermen.\\n\\nLord Tywin expects that the remaining insurgents will be ready to yield by spring, also pointing out that the North\\nwill eventually go to the son of Tyrion and Sansa. In this context, he reminds Tyrion that Joffrey is not the only one\\nwho must take a maidenhead. Tyrion asks his father acidly when he believes his wife to be most fertile; before or\\nafter he tells her that the Lannisters have killed her mother and brother.\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion V\\n↑\\nArya XI\\n ←\\nTyrion VI\\n→ \\nDavos V\\n↓\\nTyrion VII\\n\\nA Storm of Swords - Chapter 54: Davos V\\nPlace(s): \\nDragonstone\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDavos IV\\n↑\\nTyrion VI\\n ←\\nDavos V\\n→ \\nJon VII\\n↓\\nDavos VI\\nSynopsis\\nSalladhor Saan\\n tells King \\nStannis Baratheon\\n of the \\nRed Wedding\\n, how the \\nFreys\\n sewed the head of \\nRobb Stark\\n\\'s\\ndirewolf, \\nGrey Wind\\n, on the king\\'s shoulders and nailed a crown on its head. \\nCatelyn Stark\\n was slain and thrown\\nnaked into the river.

He mocks \\nBoros\\nBlount\\n for his cowardice and inability to protect Prince \\nTommen\\n, and tells him that from here on in, Blount will\\ntaste all the King’s food. Blount storms from the room, and Jaime goes after \\nOsmund Kettleblack\\n. Disgusted that an\\nupjumped \\nsellsword\\n with no reputation has been named to the Kingsguard, Jaime at least concedes that the man\\nprobably knows how to fight.\\nHaving heard the details of the Kingsguard\\'s willingness to beat \\nSansa Stark\\n on Joffrey\\'s orders, Jaime commands\\nMeryn Trant\\n to temper his obedience to the king while the king remains a boy, and to obey the \\nQueen Regent\\n, the\\nHand\\n, and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard instead. He gets \\nBalon Swann\\n to swear he will remain true to the\\nCrown, even though his \\nfather\\n and \\nbrother\\n’s allegiance are in question.\\nLastly, he questions \\nLoras Tyrell\\n, and finds the Knight of Flowers as cocky as he himself was in his youth.

As soon as the fight begins, Oberyn starts to accuse Gregor of Elia\\'s rape and\\nmurder. By using a spear as his weapon Oberyn has the advantage of being able to reach his enemy, and because he\\nis only lightly armored he is fast enough to remain out of Gregor\\'s reach.

Jaime is pretty sure she is not the real Arya, yet she is to be presented to Roose Bolton and Ramsay\\nBolton at the \\nDreadfort\\n. Ser \\nGregor\\n\\'s screams from \\nPycelle\\n\\'s solar can be heard throughout the \\nRed Keep\\n, for Lord\\nTywin has demanded that the Grand Maester heal him so that the \\nKing\\'s Justice\\n can execute him (rather than dying\\nfrom a poisoned spear) in the hopes of placating \\nDorne\\n and \\nHouse Martell\\n, who are likely to be outraged by Prince\\nOberyn\\'s\\n death. Jaime recalls his father mentioning that \\nStannis\\n and his fleet have left \\nDragonstone\\n, leaving only a\\ntoken force to guard the island. Unlike Pycelle, Tywin believes Stannis has not conceded defeat; he has only left\\nDragonstone because he intends to continue fighting elsewhere. He will likely fail if he goes to \\nStorm\\'s End\\n and tries\\nto rally the Stormlands, but if Stannis wins Dorne to his cause, he can prolong \\nthe war\\n for months or even years, so\\nTywin will not give Dorne any reason to side with Stannis.\\nLater, \\nCersei\\n visits him in the \\nWhite Sword Tower\\n, and reveals that their father plans to send her back to \\nCasterly\\nRock\\n so that he will have a free hand in raising Tommen, in addition to marrying Tommen to \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n, but\\nJaime refuses to talk to their father to convince him otherwise. Their conversation turns to the subject of \\nBran Stark\\n;\\nCersei berates him again for throwing the boy from the tower, but when Jaime questions her about \\nthe assassin\\nCatelyn Stark\\n accused them of sending after the boy, Cersei denies it. When Cersei mentions that \\nRobert\\n himself, at\\nWinterfell\\n, said it would be kinder to put the boy out of his misery while alone with her and their children, Jaime\\nfigures out that it was \\nJoffrey\\n, \\'desperate for a pat on the head from that sot\\', who sent the assassin to kill \\nBran\\n, even\\nthough Cersei does not believe him when he tells her his suspicions, just as Jaime does not believe her when Cersei\\ninsists again that \\nTyrion\\n is responsible for Joffrey\\'s death.

However, Mance does not wish to use the Horn, for if the songs can be\\nbelieved, it will cause the Wall to collapse. The wildlings have come south not to conquer, but to escape the \\nOthers\\n.\\nWithout the Wall, Mance’s people would find no safe haven, even in the south, and that is something he does not\\nwish to happen. Mance offers Jon the Horn of Winter if the Night’s Watch will let his people pass the Wall and\\nsettle the lands to the south, although he will not abide the laws or taxes of the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n.

When Jaime tells him that the rescue was a debt he owed him, Tyrion presses his brother, and learns\\nthat \\nTysha\\n was not a whore, but a crofter’s daughter, just as she appeared. Lord \\nTywin\\n had forced Jaime all those\\nyears ago to lie about Tysha so as to teach Tyrion a lesson. Tyrion is infuriated that his brother never told him the\\ntruth, and punches Jaime in the face. Tyrion warns him that he will exact revenge against him, \\ntheir father\\n, and\\nCersei\\n, as a \\nLannister\\n always pays his debts. Jaime then asks if Tyrion poisoned \\nJoffrey\\n and, lying in his anger,\\nTyrion admits to doing so.

The king makes it clear that after they finally vote in a new Lord Commander, he\\nplans to take all the castles along \\nthe Wall\\n, except for the three currently occupied by the \\nWatch\\n, to garrison his\\nforces.

The Alchemist has offered to change iron into gold,\\nrequesting that Pate steal a particular iron item in exchange for some gold, and said he would be back in three days\\nto make the exchange.\\nMollander and Armen continue their argument about dragons. Mollander says that sailors\\' tales speak of dragons in\\nfar places, often accompanied by a young queen. Alleras keeps splitting thrown apples with his arrows. After the\\nlast, he brings up the \\nTargaryens\\n, telling the others that \\nViserys Targaryen\\n\\'s sister \\nDaenerys\\n is still alive. Mollander\\ndrunkenly toasts her, only to be shushed by Armen.\\nLazy Leo\\n appears then. Mollander bristles at his appearance, Armen asking more diplomatically whether Leo wasn\\'t\\nconfined to the \\nCitadel\\n for three more days, but Leo shrugs this off with a quip on the meaninglessness of time. He\\nasks them to buy him a drink, since he lost his money gambling and eating elsewhere. He offends them each in turn,\\nthen attempts to mollify them by confirming that Daenerys is alive and has hatched three dragons, as the tales come\\nout of \\nQarth\\n. \\nArchmaester\\n \\nMarwyn\\n even gives them credence, Leo says. Marwyn, called \"The Mage\", is widely\\nconsidered unsound, partly because of his practice of speaking to smallfolk and other unwholesome people. After\\nthe others scoff, Leo adds that there is a \\ndragonglass\\n candle burning in Marwyn\\'s chambers.\\nThe group breaks up after that, most of the students returning to the Citadel. Pate remains with Leo, hoping that the\\nalchemist will still come by. Leo needles Pate a few times about Rosey.

He leaves, with a final warning to Leo to leave Rosey alone.\\nPate wanders through Oldtown in the early morning. After nearly being run down by a cart, he sees the alchemist\\nstanding over him.

Aeron admired Balon although they were not close in their youth.\\nWhen they arrive at Lord Goodbrother\\'s hall at \\nHammerhorn\\n, Aeron demands that everyone in the hall be sent away\\nso that he and Gorold Goodbrother can speak privately. Lord Goodbrother insists that his \\nmaester\\n will stay as well.\\nAeron disagrees and prepares to leave, but the maester stops him by informing him that \\nEuron Greyjoy\\n has occupied\\nthe \\nSeastone Chair\\n. Aeron is shocked. He remembers his brother but with little love. Goodbrother wants advice on\\nwhom to support, but Aeron wants to pray first and leaves for \\nPebbleton\\n.\\nAgain Aeron thinks back to his youth. He was not a very religious man but rather a drunken sod. This changed when\\nhe fell overboard in a sea battle during \\nBalon\\'s Rebellion\\n. He almost drowned and became a devoted follower of the\\nDrowned God. Aeron has discussed the succession with Balon. Though Balon wanted his daughter, \\nAsha\\n, to\\nsucceed him, Aeron did not agree with having a woman rule the \\nIron Islands\\n. \\nTheon\\n is a weakling and probably\\ndead. Balon\\'s eldest brother, \\nEuron\\n, is ungodly and Aeron hates him. Thus Aeron makes up his mind; it must be\\nVictarion\\n.\\nA few days later, Aeron has arrived at \\nPebbleton\\n and starts to preach. Asha has also claimed the throne. Now\\nAeron\\'s followers and a number of lords look to him for advice on whom to support. During his preaching, he finds\\nhis inspiration: the Ironmen should elect the king in a \\nKingsmoot\\n as they did in the old days. Every captain is to go\\nto \\nNagga\\'s Hill\\n on \\nOld Wyk\\n, the ancient place where the old kings were chosen. Aeron hears his followers take up\\nhis call and knows he has done the right thing.\\nNavigation:\\nPrologue\\n ←\\nThe Prophet\\n→ \\nThe Captain of Guards\\n↓\\nThe Drowned Man\\n\\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 2: The Captain of\\nGuards\\nPlace(s): \\nWater Gardens\\n - \\nSunspear\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nThe Prophet\\n ←\\nThe Captain of Guards\\n→ \\nCersei I\\nSynopsis\\nPrince \\nDoran\\n has been at the \\nWater Gardens\\n for nearly two years now, watching the children play in the pools while\\ntrying to deal with his gout. Captain \\nAreo Hotah\\n hears the approach of \\nObara Sand\\n, eldest of the \\nRed Viper\\n\\'s \\nbastard\\ndaughters\\n, and bars her from disturbing Prince Doran\\'s rest. Deadly as she may be, she is no match for the Captain,\\nbut the Prince calls her into his presence before they come to blows. Obara demands justice for her father, imploring\\nPrince Doran to marshal the Dornish army and give half to her so she might march on \\nOldtown\\n and burn it to the\\nground, and the other half to her half-sister Lady \\nNym\\n to march up the Kingsroad. Doran tells her that his brother\\nwas not murdered, but died in single combat, and that Lord \\nTywin\\n has promised them Ser \\nGregor\\n\\'s head.\\nUnappeased, Obara mocks her uncle for his meekness and stalks off after he tells her to await his word in \\nSunspear\\n.\\nFearing an uprising in Sunspear incited by the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran tells Hotah that he must return to his seat\\nat the Palace of the Sun. The Captain reminds him that Princess Myrcella is there, and that Ser \\nArys Oakheart\\n sends\\nletters to Queen \\nCersei\\n. Hotah thinks that he and the \\nKingsguard\\n will eventually cross swords, and when that occurs\\nthe Captain will kill him.\\nThe next morning, the prince and his retinue begin the journey back to Sunspear, but along the way they come upon\\nanother of the Sand Snakes. The beautiful \\nLady Nym\\n is far more tactful than her older half-sister, but no less\\nresolved to seek vengeance for her father. Scoffing at Obara\\'s demand to go to war, Lady Nym tells her uncle that\\nshe needs only her sister \\nTyene\\n, and the two will assassinate Cersei, \\nJaime\\n, Lord Tywin and King \\nTommen\\n. Stating\\nthat his brother was only to take the measure of \\nJoffrey\\n\\'s court and not seek revenge for \\nElia\\n despite the seventeen\\nyears that have passed, Nymeria responds in parting, \"My sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our\\nvengeance.\"\\nArriving in \\nSunspear\\n, the prince\\'s retinue is accosted by townspeople calling for vengeance for the Red Viper. In the\\nOld Palace\\n, Princess \\nArianne\\n greets her father and tells him that Tyene Sand awaits him in the throne room. The\\nthird of the Sand Snakes is embroidering when the captain encounters her while bearing Prince Doran to his high\\nseat. Tyene offers her uncle the cloth she is knitting, which shows her father mounted on a sand steed, so that he will\\nnot forget the Red Viper. Prince Doran responds, \"I am not like to forget your father.\" Tyene counsels her uncle to\\nwed his son \\nTrystane\\n to \\nMyrcella\\n now, and then crown the princess as is the \\nDornish\\n way. This would incite the\\nQueen Regent and \\nHighgarden\\n to march on Dorne, where the prince\\'s armies could bleed them in the high passes\\nand treacherous deserts. When she calls her uncle fearful, Doran advises her, \"There is a difference between fear and\\ncaution.\" Tyene raises her hand to touch her uncle, but Hotah brings the butt of his longaxe down on the marble\\nfloor, and cautions her, \"My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you.\" The Sand Snake replies that she\\nmeant no harm and loves her uncle, he loved his brother. After she takes her leave, Maester \\nCaleotte\\n rushes to the\\nPrince\\'s side to make sure he was not pricked by one of Tyene\\'s needles.\\nShortly after, Prince Doran commands the captain to round up and confine all the Sand Snakes, including \\nEllaria\\'s\\nyoung daughters. Obara, Nymeria and Tyene are locked up in cells at the top of the Spear Tower, but with no blood\\nspilled, the younger Sand Snakes are restricted together with their mother to the Water Gardens. When Hotah tells\\nhim that the common folk will howl when they find out, the \\nPrince of Dorne\\n replies, \"All Dorne will howl. I only\\npray Lord \\nTywin\\n hears them...so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear.\"\\nNavigation:\\nThe Prophet\\n ←\\nThe Captain of Guards\\n→ \\nCersei I\\n\\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 3: Cersei I\\nPlace(s): \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nChapter 2\\n ←\\nCersei I\\n→ \\nBrienne I\\n↓\\nCersei II\\nCersei\\n has a nightmare that features \\nTyrion\\n mocking her. She is woken to be informed of Lord \\nTywin\\n\\'s murder. She\\ngives order to make sure that Tyrion is safely in his cell and reflects on who could be behind the murder, settling for\\nStannis\\n and the \\nTyrells\\n as suspects. In a rush of desire for her brother, Cersei asks \\nJaime\\n to take the position of\\nHand\\n, but is rejected and settles for Ser \\nKevan\\n. Information arrives that Tyrion has escaped.\\nSynopsis\\nCersei\\n dreams that she rules from the \\nIron Throne\\n and courtiers are paying her tribute. But the pleasant dream turns\\ninto a nightmare when \\nTyrion\\n appears and ridicules her, making the great lords, proud ladies and young knights\\nsnigger at her as well. She notices she is naked and tries to cover up. Hasty moves make her wound herself on the\\nspikes and blades of the Iron Throne and soon she is engulfed in a mortal combat with the throne that is trying to rip\\nthe flesh off her.\\nShe is woken up by her frightened maid \\nSenelle\\n, accompanied by armed men who have arrived to deliver the news\\nof Lord \\nTywin\\'s\\n murder. Cersei is still drowsy and believes this to be part of her nightmare. For a moment, she\\nmistakes the \\nKingsguard\\n knight who has been sent by the \\nLord Commander\\n for \\nJaime\\n himself and expects Tyrion to\\ncrawl from under her bed to laugh at her, although she knows that he is safely in his \\nblack cell\\n and his execution will\\ntake place the same day. She drank too much wine last night, she thinks. She now recognizes \\nJocelyn Swyft\\n, Ser\\nOsmund Kettleblack\\n and Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n and notices \\nLannister\\n guards, while she is being handed lemon water to\\nwaken her up. She wonders whether the news can be true, insisting that her father is surrounded by guards day and\\nnight. Ser Osmund tells her the guards were on their post, but a secret passage has been found behind a hearth in the\\nHand\\'s Tower\\n and Jaime has gone in to inspect it. Cersei is worried about Jaime\\'s safety as well as of \\nTommen\\n\\'s, but\\nshe is told that guards supervised by Ser \\nLoras Tyrell\\n have been assigned to watch over the King. This stirs up her\\nresentment against the \\nTyrells\\n and she wonders whether the murder was their doing, yet does not dare to speak this\\naloud. She commands Ser Osmund to escort her to the Tower of the Hand and Ser Boros to make certain that Tyrion\\nis still in his cell. She doesn\\'t believe Tyrion would dare to raise a hand against their father, but needs to be certain.\\nOutside, the sun is beginning to rise while the stars can still be seen, making Cersei think that the great star of the\\nwest has fallen. Ser Osmund tells her that \\nLum\\n, one of the guards, found the body in the privy. She already feels the\\nhole left by Lord Tywin and decides to act swiftly as she suspects there will be attempts to push her aside, as always.\\nShe wonders whether \\nStannis Baratheon\\n is behind the murder. She enters the tower, thinking that not crying makes\\nher the only true son her father ever had. Climbing the many stairs to the Hand\\'s chambers prompts her to think\\nabout tearing the tower down. As she enters the hall, she finds the room full of guards and servants, whispering\\namong themselves. Cersei resents their presence as well as the fact that she was not called first. She orders Ser\\nMeryn Trant\\n to show the people out and is informed that her father\\'s body has been brought to his bed. When she\\nenters the bedchamber, guards are present again as well as her distraught uncle \\nKevan\\n, kneeling by the bed and\\ntrying to pray for his brother. She notices how small the door to the secret passage behind the hearth is, making her\\nthink of Tyrion again, then settling for Stannis or the Tyrells as more likely suspects. She knows about the rumors of\\nsecret passages in the \\nRed Keep\\n and that \\nMaegor the Cruel\\n supposedly killed the builders of the castle to keep them\\nsecret. She thinks of other, yet undiscovered, secret passages to other bedchambers and has a vision of Tyrion using\\none to get to Tommen.\\nCersei has a look at her father\\'s half-naked body. While reflecting on how he looks much older and smaller than\\nwhen he was alive, she already notices a smell emanating from the corpse. She is furious that the quarrel that killed\\n\\nLord Tywin has been left in his stomach and orders it to be removed. Cersei wonders whether she should act\\ndesperate and claw her own face, as she heard \\nCatelyn Stark\\n did when her son \\nRobb\\n was killed before her eyes, and\\nwonders how Lord Tywin once received news of his \\nown father\\'s\\n death. She commands that the bells must toll for\\nher father just as they did for \\nKing Robert\\n. She asks for \\nPycelle\\n and wants him to prepare the body, but is told that\\nthe \\nGrand Maester\\n has already been there and left again. This angers her more because of Pycelle\\'s uselessness in\\nold age and she calls for Maesters \\nBallabar\\n and \\nFrenken\\n instead. Cersei asks about Jaime and is again told he\\'s down\\nin the secret passage, inspecting the depth of a shaft found there. She is worried about his safety, thinking of his lost\\nhand and how the murderer might await him in the dark.\\nQyburn\\n is shown in, offering his service as maester. He informs her that he treated Jaime\\'s hand and she remembers\\nthat he came down from \\nHarrenhal\\n with her brother. She notices that he doesn\\'t have a maester\\'s chain, receiving the\\nanswer that it has been taken away by the \\nCitadel\\n while his knowledge is still there. She orders him to remove the\\nquarrel and prepare her father\\'s body for the silent sisters. Qyburn asks her what he should do with the girl. Cersei\\nhas not noticed the second body in the bed before and takes a look at her naked body, observing the golden chain\\naround her neck and that her face is as black as \\nJoffrey\\'s\\n was when he died. She is furious and demands to know\\nwhat the girl is doing there, receiving the unsatisfying answer that she has been found where she is and that she was\\nTyrion\\'s whore. She thinks that Lord Tywin never used whores and defensively tells a guard how he treated his own\\nfather\\'s mistress after his death, parading her naked through the streets of \\nLannisport\\n. Qyburn suggests that Lord\\nTywin might have been questioning the girl about her mistress \\nSansa Stark\\n\\'s disappearance. Cersei eagerly seizes on\\nthis notion but has a vision of Tyrion mocking it. She can\\'t stand staying in the room with the girl any longer and\\ngoes back to the hall.\\nShe finds Ser Osmund accompanied by his brothers \\nOsney\\n and \\nOsfryd\\n and orders them to make certain that nobody\\nwill ever hear about the dead girl in her father\\'s bed. Her body is to be disposed of no matter how and everyone who\\ntalks about this matter will have their tongues torn out. She watches as the Kettleblacks put the girl\\'s body in a\\nblanket, remembering that the girl\\'s name was \\nShae\\n and that she came to her the night before Tyrion\\'s trial by\\ncombat, asking that promises made to her by Tyrion and, allegedly, Cersei be kept, including a manse in the city and\\na knight to marry. Cersei made it clear that she would get nothing until she told them the whereabouts of Sansa\\nStark, making her leave in tears. She orders the Kettleblacks to carry Shae\\'s body out through the secret passage, but\\nwants to have the chain around her neck delivered to herself.\\nAs Ser Osfryd is about to step into the tunnel, Jaime emerges from it. She rushes towards him, asking whether he\\nhas found the killers, but is told that the shaft ends in a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet, some of them\\nclosed with locked iron gates, and Jaime needs to find keys first. He suggests that the killers could still be hiding in\\nthe maze he just left. Cersei again envisions Tyrion climbing through the walls like some monstrous rat, then\\nreassures herself with the thought that he is in his cell. She says she wants the murderers to be found and that the\\nwhole tower will be demolished if need be. Jaime hugs her to console her and she has a rush of desire for him. She\\nwhispers in his ear, asking him to take over as \\nHand of the King\\n to complete their father\\'s work. But he pushes her\\naway, declines the offer, makes a joke about a Hand without a hand and says that she shouldn\\'t ask him to rule.\\nCersei feels the rejection like a slap, realizing that it has been noticed by everyone present and that the whole castle\\nwill know soon. She angrily says that she didn\\'t ask him to rule, as she is going to do that herself as the Queen\\nRegent until Tommen comes of age. Jaime replies that he doesn\\'t know whom to feel worse for, Tommen or the\\nSeven Kingdoms\\n. She slaps him. They are both admonished by Ser Kevan to take their indecent behavior out of the\\nroom where their father\\'s body lies. Jaime apologizes for his sister, pointing out that she is forgetting herself while\\ngrief-stricken. This makes Cersei want to slap him again and regret her impulse to ask him. She wonders whether the\\nposition of Hand should be abolished altogether, remembering how \\nJon Arryn\\n and \\nEddard Stark\\n meddled in her\\naffairs, the latter forcing her to get rid of King Robert before she could deal with his brothers, and how Tyrion sold\\nMyrcella\\n to \\nDorne\\n, made Tommen a hostage and killed Joffrey.\\nCersei settles on her uncle Kevan as the next Hand, as she considers him loyal and prudent while unambitious to\\nchallenge her as the real power behind the Iron Throne. She thinks that she needs men supporting her and that the\\ncurrent \\nsmall council\\n will not do, with Grand Maester Pycelle too old and Lord \\nMace Tyrell\\n and his bannermen\\nLord \\nPaxter Redwyne\\n and Lord \\nMathis Rowan\\n not to be trusted; she also can\\'t rely on Jaime, who has lost his\\ncourage with his hand. She again considers the possibility of the Tyrells being involved in the murder, as Lord Mace\\nmust have known he can never rule the Seven Kingdoms as long as Tywin Lannister is alive. However, she realizes\\nshe has to proceed carefully against the Tyrells, with the city full of their men and \\nLoras Tyrell\\n now knight of the\\n\\nKingsguard. The thought of the engagement of Tommen and \\nMargaery Tyrell\\n still makes her furious and she\\nquestions Margaery\\'s virginity. Cersei intends to use \\nVarys\\n to find out more on this front.\\nThe thought of Varys makes Cersei aware that the eunuch isn\\'t present, while he is usually around when something\\nimportant happens in the Red Keep. The only explanation for his absence is that he was involved in the plot,\\npreempting his own downfall as Lord Tywin never had any love for him. She thinks that Varys might have known\\nabout the secret passage and acted on behalf of Stannis. She orders Ser Meryn to find the \\nMaster of Whisperers\\n and\\nbring him to her.\\nSer Boros returns red-faced and puffing, announcing that Tyrion is gone, his cell open, with no sign of him\\nanywhere. Cersei is appalled, thinking her nightmares are coming true. She points out her orders to keep the Imp\\nunder guard day and night. Ser Boros says that a goaler called \\nRugen\\n has gone missing while two others were found\\nasleep. She orders for them to be killed. Cersei\\'s paranoia about Tyrion breaks out fully and reflects that he has\\nalready killed her mother, her father and her eldest son and will try to murder her too, remembering the prophecy\\nshe once received about her little brother killing her. She gets queasy and Ser Boros tries to sustain her, but she\\nrecoils from his touch, thinking that the knight of the Kingsguard might be one of Tyrion\\'s creatures, too. He offers\\nher a cup of water, but all she wants is Tyrion\\'s blood. She envisions Tyrion grinning at her, feeling his hands\\nclosing in around her neck the very moment she thought she was rid of him.\\nNavigation:\\nChapter 2\\n ←\\nCersei I\\n→ \\nBrienne I\\n↓\\nCersei II\\n\\nA Feast for Crows - Chapter 4: Brienne I\\nPlace(s): \\nRosby road\\n between \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n and \\nDuskendale\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nCersei I\\n ←\\nBrienne I\\n→ \\nSamwell I\\n↓\\nBrienne II\\nSynopsis\\nBrienne\\n is traveling to \\nDuskendale\\n, seeking the whereabouts of \\nSansa\\n as she was charged to do by \\nJaime\\n.

Upon \\nthe road\\n beyond \\nRosby\\n, she comes upon a camp with two hedge knights who offer\\nto share their meal. Mistaking her at first for a man, Ser \\nIllifer\\n later remarks on how she bears a shield with the sigil\\nof \\nHouse Lothston\\n, a disgraced family who once held \\nHarrenhal\\n. Brienne was given the shield by Ser Jaime, who\\nhad taken it from Harrenhal. When she tells the two that she lost her own shield, Ser Illifer figures out by her size\\nthat she must be Brienne, murderess of King \\nRenly\\n. The Maid denies having killed Renly, and the hedge knights\\nagree to travel with her to Duskendale.\\nAfter passing a large group of poor fellows (or \\'\\nsparrows\\n\\'), lowly holy men bound for King\\'s Landing bearing the\\nbones of septons killed around the Riverlands, they catch up to a merchant guarded by a couple of men and another\\nhedge knight named Ser \\nShadrich\\n. Joining forces along the dangerous road, Ser Shadrich tells Brienne in private that\\nhe knows that the maid she seeks is Sansa Stark, and that he seeks her as well, but for a purse of gold offered by\\nVarys\\n. Brienne is disturbed by the fact that the knight knew whom she was speaking of when she repeated Sansa\\'s\\ndescription to the merchant\\'s group.

She worries. \\nTommen\\n seems to have a cold and the\\ncurrent \\nHigh Septon\\n was appointed by \\nTyrion\\n. She wonders if she should have him removed. Tommen and Cersei\\nboth notice the stench that is emanating from her father\\'s corpse.\\nAfter the service, the procession of mourners come to offer condolences to Cersei. First is \\nFalyse Stokeworth\\n, who\\nmentions that \\nher sister\\n is ready to give birth and the family would like to name the child Tywin. Cersei is offended\\nand brusquely forbids her. Next is \\nLancel\\n who is still looking half dead. As he begins to mention his love and then\\nhis new-found faith, Cersei heads him off by saying, \"Atonement is best achieved through prayer.

The Queen Regent, not wishing to see another Tyrell on the small council, immediately backpedals that\\nGyles Rosby\\n has already accepted the post. This upsets Tyrell and \\nhis mother\\n, as Tywin had wanted Garth to assume\\nthe position. The Queen of Thorns then brings up the terrible smell in the sept, and Cersei wants nothing more than\\nto get rid of the clever old woman. But Lady Olenna states she will not depart until \\nMargaery\\n is wed to Tommen.\\nLeaving the Sept, Cersei rides back to the \\nRed Keep\\n with \\nGyles Rosby\\n, asking him belatedly to be her new master of\\ncoin, which he accepts.\\nBack in her rooms, \\nQyburn\\n pays her a visit, revealing that he discovered in the undergaoler\\'s sleeping cell a gold\\ncoin that dated back to the \\nGardener\\n Kings of the Reach. Once again, Cersei is suspicious that the \\nTyrells\\n had a hand\\nin Tyrion\\'s escape and Tywin\\'s murder. Qyburn then asks if he may experiment on the dying \\nGregor Clegane\\n in the\\nblack cells\\n, since he is more adept at the nature of death than any of the \\narchmaesters\\n from the \\nCitadel\\n.

Kevan first admonishes her for making Mace Tyrell look a fool in front of\\nhalf the court. He then informs her that he would rather help his son Lancel take control of Castle \\nDarry\\n.

He also finds himself wondering what\\nhappened to the eunuch. His thoughts then turn to the day that Prince \\nRhaegar\\n rode for the \\nTrident\\n. Jaime had\\nbegged not to be left behind to guard the king, but Rhaegar told him that \\nAerys\\n feared Lord Tywin more than he did\\nRobert\\n, and meant to keep Jaime at his side as insurance. Mounting up, Rhaegar\\'s last words to Jaime were, \"When\\nthis battle\\'s done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but...well, it does no\\ngood to speak of roads not taken.\" Finally, Jaime recalls his recent questioning of the \\nchief undergaoler\\n, which was a\\ncomplete farce as Jaime knew far more than the man did, since he was the perpetrator.\\nWhen Jaime learned that the two gaolers who were put to sleep were killed by \\nBoros Blount\\n and \\nOsmund\\nKettleblack\\n, he reprimanded them, warning them never to act on \\nhis sister\\n\\'s orders to kill anyone without consulting\\nhim first. Some time in the middle of the night, Cersei visits him with news of \\nKevan\\n\\'s refusal to become her \\nHand\\n,\\nas well as remarking that Kevan knows about their relationship. She implores Jaime to reconsider being Hand, but\\nJaime rejects her again. She departs with, \"Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you.\" The\\nnext morning, the mourners arrive anew, but the smell is so nauseating that \\nTommen\\n gets sick. Jaime takes him\\noutside to console him, advising him to \"go away inside\", something Tommen understands from when \\nJoffrey\\n would\\ntorment him. Cersei then joins them, as does \\nMace Tyrell\\n, and Jaime asks the Lord of \\nHighgarden\\n to have dinner\\nwith his sister. When Mace departs, Jaime tells Cersei to get the wedding over with, and then send Lord Mace to\\nbesiege \\nStorm\\'s End\\n once again.

He asks if she still means to burn down the\\nTower of the Hand\\n after the wedding, but she is determined to see it destroyed, and hopefully smoke out a few rats\\nin the process. We begin to notice changes in Cersei, including weight gain and overindulgence in alcohol.\\nTommen\\'s wedding is a modest affair compared to \\nhis brother\\n\\'s, and the ceremony goes over well enough.\\nAfterwards, \\nKevan\\n comes over to Cersei and mentions that \\nSandor Clegane\\n is reported to have joined \\nBeric\\nDondarrion\\n\\'s \\noutlaws\\n. The queen is already aware of this, having heard that outlaws have pillaged \\nSaltpans\\n and\\nsavagely raped the townswomen. The report mentioned that they were led by a huge man in a hound\\'s head helmet.\\nCersei suggests that \\nLancel\\n hunt down the Hound, but her uncle scoffs that his son is not the man to deal with\\nClegane. When she then suggests that he go after Clegane himself, Ser Kevan responds, \"When a dog goes bad, the\\nfault lies with its master.\" Talking to Jaime, she wonders if Margaery is really a maiden, and he tells her that \\nMace\\nTyrell\\n will be marching on \\nStorm\\'s End\\n in a few days, while \\nGarlan Tyrell\\n will take half the Tyrell host to\\nBrightwater Keep\\n and then on to \\nHighgarden\\n, including Lady \\nAlerie Tyrell\\n and Lady Olenna. During the reception,\\nCersei recalls her visit to a \\nwoods witch\\n when she was younger, and the old hag\\'s words: Queen you shall be, until\\nthere comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear. Drinking heavily\\nduring the feast, she begins to wonder if Margaery is the one in the hag\\'s prophecy, which also mentions the\\nvalonqar\\n.\\nWhen Tommen chokes on his wine accidentally, Cersei flees the hall for some air.

Asking why the beauty from Myr would venture\\nthis info, Taena responds that she wants what is best for her \\nhusband\\n and \\nson\\n, and Cersei could provide\\nadvancement for \\nher family\\n. Back inside, Cersei refuses to dance with anyone, but takes note of how attractive the\\nBastard of Driftmark, \\nAurane Waters\\n, is: with his silvery hair - a mark of \\nhouse Velaryon\\n which is descended from\\nthe Freehold of \\nValyria\\n like \\nthe Targaryens\\n - he almost resembles \\nPrince Rhaegar\\n.\\nTowards the end of the night, Cersei leads everyone outside to watch as the pyromancers set the Tower of the Hand\\non fire.

Hailing from \\nthe Reach\\n, the Oakhearts\\nhave long been enemies of the Dornish. The kingsguard knight left \\nMyrcella\\n playing \\ncyvasse\\n with Prince \\nTrystane\\n,\\nand under the protection of the prince\\'s \\nsworn shield\\n Ser \\nGascoyne\\n. Arys recalls his recent first meeting with Prince\\nDoran\\n, who advised him that Myrcella would be safer at the \\nWater Gardens\\n. All her guards and Ser Arys would\\naccompany them there, but Doran asked him not to write \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n about the move. When he arrives at\\nArianne\\'s secret location, he swears he will do no more than tell her it has to end, but her nakedness overwhelms\\nhim.\\nAfter their passion is sated, Arys is once again consumed by guilt, but Arianne has a response for every one of his\\ndoubts. The knight feels he has dishonored himself enough already, and he doesn\\'t want to dishonor her. But\\nArianne\\'s seductive words and gestures are difficult for him to disregard. When Arianne reminds him that he told her\\nhe loved her, Arys responds that he has sworn a vow. However, Arianne brings up several Kingsguard who broke\\ntheir vows, most famously \\nLucamore the Lusty\\n and \\nTerrence Toyne\\n, and even Prince \\nAemon the Dragonknight\\n(though Ser Arys doesn\\'t believe the latter story). She finishes with, \"It is not our love that dishonored you, it is the\\nmonsters you have served and the brutes you\\'ve called your brothers.\" When Arys tells her that King \\nRobert\\n was no\\nmonster, he can\\'t help but think that she is right about \\nJoffrey\\n. Although he considers \\nTommen\\n to be Joffrey\\'s\\nopposite, he can\\'t disagree with Arianne\\'s persuasive words that Myrcella would be a better ruler.\\nTheir conversation moves to \\nCriston Cole\\n, Lord Commander of \\nViserys I\\n\\'s Kingsguard. At the time of Viserys\\'\\ndeath, Ser Cole convinced Viserys\\' son Aegon II to claim the rule of the Seven Kingdoms. This led to the war\\nbetween Aegon and his elder sister Rhaenyra, whom Viserys had long groomed as his succession.\\nArianne reminds Arys that in Dorne, the eldest child rules, and had it not been for Criston the Kingmaker, even the\\nTargaryen inheritance might have been rewritten. She then explains to him the real reason that Myrcella is being\\nmoved to the Water Gardens: \"To keep her away from those who\\'d seek to crown her.\" Arys tells her that the Water\\nGardens are not a prison, but she warns him that \\nHotah\\n will see that Myrcella does not leave, claiming he is terrible\\nwhen aroused.\\nStill unable to convince Arys that her suggestions are correct, Arianne hugs him and begins to tremble. Once again,\\nshe manipulates him by asserting that if the \\nSand Snakes\\n can be imprisoned by her father for wanting to crown\\nMyrcella, she could too. She mentions that there are no secrets between \\nTyene\\n and herself, and then tells him her\\nfather has never considered her worthy. Prince Doran tried several times to marry her off to old men of high birth,\\nand when she was 14 she discovered a letter her father had written to her brother \\nQuentyn\\n, a ward of \\nLord Anders\\nYronwood\\n for years. In the letter, Doran wrote, \"one day you will sit where I sit and rule all of Dorne, and a ruler\\nmust be strong of mind and body.\"\\nSer Arys argues that this couldn\\'t be true, but when she asks him where Prince Quentyn is now and his response is\\nwith Lord Anders Yronwood in the \\nBoneway\\n, Arianne tells him that is what her father wants everyone to believe.\\nShe has gotten word from some of her friends that Quentyn is across the \\nNarrow Sea\\n, and she is sure that he is hiring\\nthe \\nGolden Company\\n, who recently broke their contract with \\nMyr\\n. The Golden Company has never broken their\\nword since \\nBittersteel\\n reformed them nearly a hundred years ago, and since most of their members are exiles, the\\nonly reason they would change allegiance would be to return home to \\nWesteros\\n. And Anders\\' ancestors fought in\\nthree of the \\nBlackfyre Rebellions\\n, a fact that convinces Arianne that he seeks to crown Quentyn as the next Prince of\\n\\nDorne.\\nArianne\\'s final persuasive words are, \"So your two princesses share a common cause, ser... and they share as well a\\nknight who claims to love them both, but will not fight for them.\" Ser Arys then swears to defend Myrcella\\'s right to\\nrule, and to protect Arianne from anyone seeking to steal her birthright. When he asks her what she would have of\\nhim, Arianne purrs, \"All. All my love, my sweet love, and forever.

Wary of their intentions, Brienne was still vulnerable thanks to hope, but she soon learned the truth. Randyll\\nTarly called her before him to reveal what he had learned of their game through his son \\nDickon\\n. The knights\\ninvolved had a burgeoning wager on who could claim her maidenhead. Tarly ended their game, but told her the fault\\nlay with herself, claiming her being here encouraged them and that a war host is no place for a maiden.\\nWhen Dick Crabb finally arrives, Brienne offers to buy him drinks. Nimble Dick soon launches into his story, egged\\non by a steady bribe from Brienne. He explains how he offered to help a frightened fool make it across the \\nNarrow\\nSea\\n. The fool claimed he had two girls with him, but couldn\\'t chance the ports in Maidenpool. So Dick took his coin\\nand took him and the girls along the shore to an old, now-unused smuggler\\'s cove, up past \\nCrackclaw Point\\n.

But\\nCersei cares not, nor does she care who becomes \\nHigh Septon\\n, provided he \"pronounce(s) an anathema upon the\\nImp.\"\\nThe next topic is a letter by the \\nLords Declarant\\n in \\nthe Vale\\n of Arryn, but the Queen Regent decides not to intervene\\ndirectly on \\nLittlefinger\\n\\'s behalf, but only send a letter warning these Lords that no harm must come to Lord Petyr.\\nWhen the subject of rebuilding the fleet comes up, Cersei is adamant against making any pact with the \\nironborn\\n,\\nstating, \"Their turn will come, once we have dealt with \\nStannis\\n.\" Aurane Waters will get his fleet of dromonds\\nhowever, and Cersei will find the coin by deferring the crown\\'s debt to the \\nFaith of the Seven\\n and to the \\nIron Bank\\nof Braavos\\n until the end of the \\nwar\\n. Pycelle warns her against this route, cautioning that it would be foolish to make\\nan enemy of the Iron Bank, but the decision is made regardless.\\nThe council also discusses the prudence of making someone pay for the \\nRed Wedding\\n so as to appease all the\\n\"sparrows\"; and in the mean time offering whomever succeeds the sure-to-die-soon Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n a chance to\\nrid himself of unwanted brothers, half-brothers and nephews.\\nOn the topic of the \\nNorth\\n, the council indicates that Stannis may soon be confronted by \\nRoose Bolton\\n\\'s army, once\\nhis bastard son\\n hits \\nMoat Cailin\\n from the north, allowing the Lord of the \\nDreadfort\\n passage through \\nthe Neck\\n. Cersei\\nmentions that \\nWyman Manderly\\n has taken \\nDavos Seaworth\\n captive, after the latter was sent by Stannis to treat with\\nhim. When \\nSansa\\n is mentioned, Cersei shocks the council into silence with a violent tirade about how she plans to\\ndeal with the girl once she is found. In the uneasy silence that follows, Cersei also remarks that Lord Bolton\\npossesses \\nArya Stark\\n and that her marriage to his bastard should appease the north, keeping to herself the fact that\\n\"Arya Stark\" is really a \"\\nsteward\\'s whelp\\n\" provided by Littlefinger.\\nNext they debate the fact that the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n might be joining its might to Stannis, especially now that \\nJon Snow\\n\\nis their Lord Commander.

Second, she plans to send him to the \\nWall\\n as \"punishment\" for his\\ntreason with Margaery, but in reality he will lead a group of men to assassinate \\nJon Snow\\n.

While his \\nelder brother\\n supports Petyr\\'s\\nposition as Lord Protector of the Vale, Ser Lyn has taken up with the Lords Declarant.

But Yohn Royce tells him they did not come to obtain his\\nsignature; they are here to remove Littlefinger and take Lord Robert to foster at \\nRunestone\\n. Petyr informs them that\\nhe plans to foster the sons of other lords here so that Robert will have boys his own age around. He also asks Lady\\nAnya Waynwood\\n to send \\nHarrold Hardyng\\n to the Eyrie as his ward, but the Lords scoff at this request. Littlefinger\\nrefuses their demand that he leave the Vale and turn over Robert, and after he calls their bluffs of violence, Lyn\\nCorbray draws Lady Forlorn, but this enrages the other Lords Declarant, and Bronze Yohn tells the knight to up his\\nsteel, reminding him that they are guests.

The Queen Regent evades this by mentioning Robert\\'s deeds at the Trident. She then berates\\nLoras\\n for teaching Tommen how to ride, but the Kingsguard reminds her that there has been no master-at-arms at\\nthe \\nRed Keep\\n since \\nAron Santagar\\n was killed.

Afterwards, Sam tries to avoid Gilly, but \\nKojja\\n corners him and tells him that what he and\\nGilly did was considered holy in the \\nSummer Islands\\n, a way of honoring the dead by celebrating life. Kojja advises\\nSam that Gilly knows they can never be man and wife, but there was nothing wrong with them comforting each\\nother on the long journey.

She vividly recalls \\nMaggy the Frog\\n\\'s plea that they leave\\nher, but Cersei and \\nMelara\\n will not back down. Maggy commands them to cut open their thumbs, and the old\\neasterner tastes their blood. She prophesized that Cersei would marry the \\nking\\n (not the \\nPrince\\n, as Cersei thought),\\nbut her husband would father 16 children and Cersei only three, and that she would reign as queen only \"until there\\ncomes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear...

The de-\\nchained maester suggests that she already knew how to forestall the prophecy. Seizing upon this suggestion, Cersei\\nplans a fool-proof way to have Margaery killed. Deciding that treason would work best, the next day she inquires of\\nSer \\nOsmund\\n if his brother \\nOsney\\n could defeat Ser Boros in single combat.

Jaime responds that the girl has been pardoned and no harm will come to her, nor anyone else if\\nBrynden yields Riverrun; they will be free to go or \\ntake the black\\n as they choose, but Brynden dismisses the offer,\\nclaiming that he and his men would rather die with swords in their hands than \\n\"be paraded through \\nKing\\'s Landing\\nto die like \\nEddard Stark\\n\"\\n.

Jaime challenges the older knight to single\\ncombat, with each choosing a champion. When Brynden prods Jaime to face him himself, Jaime cannot help but rise\\nto the bait. But the Blackfish is not so foolish as to trust that Jaime\\'s terms would be honored.

When Bastard Walder and Lord Clement nearly come to blows when\\nPiper challenges Edwyn to a duel over a threat to Lord Clement\\'s heir, Jaime silences them, ending the council\\nprematurely. Lord Clement storms out, and Lord Vance explains to Jaime that as well as his first born son, several of\\nLord Clement\\'s cousins and nephews accompanied Marq to the Twins, and are either captives or dead. When Edwyn\\ndenounces them as traitors and rebels, Jaime coldly retorts that the Freys first rebelled against the Crown with Robb\\nStark and then betrayed him, making them twice the traitors House Piper are. Jaime takes enjoyment out of watching\\nEdwyn\\'s smug attitude evaporate at that remark.\\nSummoning Ser \\nIlyn Payne\\n and Ser \\nLyle Crakehall\\n, Jaime heads straight for the Frey camp. He first has Payne cut\\nloose Edmure Tully, and when Edwyn and his father, Ser Ryman, come forth to protest, he warns them to keep\\nquiet. When Ryman persists, stating that he is the heir to the Crossing, Jaime punches him in the face with his\\ngolden hand. He then dismisses Ryman back to the Twins, sick of the man\\'s whoring and drinking, and takes the\\nbladed crown that his whore wears. When Jaime places Edwyn in charge of the Freys, Jaime witnesses a glimpse of\\nthe contempt Edwyn feels for his own father.

She\\nconsiders who could have betrayed her, ponders her feelings at the loss of \\nSer Arys\\n, and thinks of her close\\nrelationship with \\nTyene\\n.

Although the \\nYoung Dragon\\n wrote that\\nDorne\\n was populous, his memoirs were written to portray himself in a better light. Prince Doran admits that Dorne is\\nactually the least populous of the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n, and could not survive open war with the Throne. He admits it\\nwas a mistake not to have had her taken prior to running off with Myrcella, but he will not reveal who betrayed her.\\nWhen he tells her that she disappoints him, Arianne retorts, \"You have been disappointing me for years, Father.\"\\nPrince Doran discloses that none of her co-conspirators are imprisoned. Instead, he has sent Ser \\nAndrey Dalt\\n to\\nNorvos\\n to serve Arianne\\'s mother; Garin is in \\nTyrosh\\n for two years; and \\nSylva\\n was sent to \\nGreenstone\\n to marry Lord\\nEldon Estermont\\n.

The Septa reveals\\nthat Margaery\\'s maidenhead is not intact. Grand Maester \\nPycelle\\n also reluctantly discloses to the Septa that\\nMargaery has had him mix \\nmoon tea\\n on many occasions. Leaving the throne room confident that Margaery was\\nfinished, \\nCersei\\n agrees with \\nAurane Waters\\n\\' request to launch his new dromonds, in case Lord \\nMace Tyrell\\n decides\\nto march on \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n to save his daughter. Lord \\nOrton Merryweather\\n remarks that the High Septon may want\\nto try Margaery himself, as the Faith used to do. Cersei hopes he is right.\\nCersei has \\nTommen\\n sign some blank warrants, which she then affixes names to. Summoning Ser \\nOsfryd\\n, she orders\\nhim to arrest Ser \\nTallad\\n, the \\nBlue Bard\\n, \\nHugh Clifton\\n, \\nMark Mullendore\\n, as well as the \\nRedwyne\\n twins whom she\\nwants to be found innocent of the charges of bedding Margaery. The next morning, Cersei and \\nTaena\\n are carried by\\nlitter to the Great Sept. On the way, Lady Merryweather inquires, \"What if Margaery demands that her innocence be\\ndetermined by battle?\" Cersei smiles, and replies that she must be championed by a knight of the \\nKingsguard\\n, but\\nsince Ser \\nOsmund\\n is brother to one of her accusers, that leaves only Ser \\nMeryn Trant\\n and Ser \\nBoros Blount\\n. Cersei\\nstates that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes. Within the Sept, the High Septon grants Cersei\\npermission to visit her good-daughter, while Taena goes to speak with Margaery\\'s cousins. Margaery is beside\\nherself, stripped of her clothes and dignity, while she is asked once an hour to confess her fornication. Cersei tells\\nher that she has rounded up all those that Ser Osney named, lying that they will reveal her innocence. When Cersei\\nsays that a sworn brother of the Kingsguard will fight for her should it come to a trial by combat, Margaery demands\\nthat her own brother, Ser \\nGarlan the Gallant\\n, be summoned to fight in place of the grievously injured Ser \\nLoras\\n.\\nCersei would never allow this to happen; and Margaery, well aware of Cersei\\'s intentions, tells her to leave, calling\\nher a vile, scheming, evil bitch.\\nCersei is then escorted deep beneath \\nVisenya\\'s Hill\\n to speak with the High Septon. He tells her that seven will sit in\\njudgment of Margaery and her cousins, as the Faith did in yore, before King \\nJaehaerys I Targaryen\\n stripped them of\\nthis power. When Cersei asks to have Ser Osney released into her custody, the priest flatly denies her. Chained to\\nthe ceiling of his cell, Osney has been brutally whipped. Infuriated, Cersei tells the High Septon that Osney came of\\nhis own free will. The holy man responds, \"I have heard many men confess, but seldom have I heard a man so\\npleased to be so guilty... The more diligently we applied the scourge, the more Ser Osney\\'s offenses seemed to\\nchange. He would now have us believe that he never touched Margaery Tyrell.\" When asked now if he had carnal\\nknowledge of the queen, Osney points at Cersei, saying, \"Aye. That one there.\" Furthermore, he confesses that\\nCersei ordered him to kill the old High Septon. Upon hearing this, Cersei bolts from the cell, racing headlong\\nthrough the Great Sept. Fearing what may happen should the Faith question Taena Merryweather, she is soon\\novertaken by a group of septas, who strip her and confine her to a grim cell.\\nHer screams going unheard, Cersei begins to shiver from the cold. Every time she begins to fall asleep, she is jostled\\nawake and asked if she will confess her sins. After two days of this torture, \\nQyburn\\n enters her cell. She begs him to\\ntake her home, but the de-chained maester tells her it will not be allowed and she will be tried for murder, treason,\\nand fornication. He reveals that Margaery will be tried by the same court, and that he delivered the Blue Bard to the\\n\\nHigh Septon, but despite the Faith\\'s torture, \"he is still singing the same sweet song we taught him\". Qyburn then\\ninforms her of the rapid changes made since her fall: the realm is now being governed by Ser \\nHarys Swyft\\n and\\nPycelle; they removed Ser Osfryd as Commander of the gold cloaks and Qyburn from the small council (though he\\nstill works for them thanks to his control of \\nVarys\\n\\' whisperers); Lord Orton and Taena have fled to \\nLongtable\\n, while\\nSer \\nKevan\\n has been sent for to take over the Regency. Perhaps worst of all, Aurane Waters unshipped his oars and\\nsailed the fleet, possibly to join Lord \\nStannis\\n; while Lord Mace Tyrell and Lord \\nRandyll Tarly\\n are marching on\\nKing\\'s Landing\\n.\\nDespite Qyburn\\'s words that his unbeatable \"champion\" is ready, Cersei knows that only a Kingsguard can defend\\nher in a trial by combat.

Despite a massive search for Lord \\nHoster\\n\\'s brother, Jaime\\nknows the Blackfish will not be found, nor will he abandon the fight. Before being escorted west to \\nCasterly Rock\\n as\\na noble prisoner, Ser Edmure speaks his mind, \"You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room,\\nKingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you.\"\\nLater, Lady \\nSybell Westerling\\n and her daughter, the widowed Queen \\nJeyne Stark\\n, are brought before Jaime. Jeyne is\\nin mourning for her husband and defiant to her mother, but when Sybell moves to slap her, Jaime intervenes and\\nkindly asks Jeyne to leave the solar. Jaime confirms to Lady Sybell that House Westerling has its pardon, her brother\\nhas been named Lord of Castamere and marriages will be arranged for her daughters, though Jeyne will have to wait\\ntwo years before marrying again, to prevent rumours that any children she has are actually \\nRobb Stark\\n\\'s. Lady\\nSybell asks Jaime to inquire after her son, Ser \\nRaynald\\n, who accompanied Robb to \\nthe Twins\\n, and had no\\nknowledge of the arrangement between his mother and \\nTywin Lannister\\n. Jaime, suspecting that Raynald is likely\\ndead as Walder Frey also didn\\'t know of the arrangement, agrees to inquire, promising that House Lannister will pay\\nhis ransom if Raynald is held captive. She then mentions that Lord Tywin promised a high-born marriage for him,\\n\"that Raynald should have joy of him\". When Jaime states that \\nJoy\\n is his uncle \\nGerion\\n\\'s natural daughter, Sybell\\nshouts, \"You want a Westerling to marry a bastard?\". Jaime, desiring to strangle the woman with her own necklace,\\nretorts \"No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch. Your daughter is worth ten of\\nyou, my lady. You\\'ll leave with Edmure and Ser \\nForley\\n on the morrow. Until then, you would do well to stay out of\\nmy sight.\" He then contemplates how much Lord \\nGawen\\n knew of his wife\\'s schemes.\\nThe following morning, Jaime warns Ser Forley Prester to guard Ser Edmure well, for fear either the Blackfish or\\nBeric Dondarrion\\n might try to free him. The knight is aware of his orders to kill Edmure should he try to slip away.\\nJaime adds that he should do the same for Jeyne Stark, stating that she is twice as dangerous as Edmure, should she\\nescape. Jaime then visits \\nEdwyn Frey\\n, who is preparing his army to return to the Twins. Edwyn divulges that his\\nfather, Ser \\nRyman\\n, along with his entire retinue, were hanged by Lady \\nStoneheart\\n near \\nFairmarket\\n. Although Edwyn\\nblames Jaime, the Lord Commander is well aware that Edwyn couldn\\'t care less that his father is dead. And although\\nEdwyn is now heir to the Twins, Jaime knows that \\nBlack Walder\\n will probably soon move to kill his brother. Jaime\\'s\\nonly real concern is that the \\noutlaws\\n must be getting bolder if they are willing to kill Lord Walder\\'s heir only a day\\'s\\nride from the Twins. Jaime takes his leave after inquiring about Ser Raynald\\'s fate. Apparently, Queen Jeyne\\'s\\nbrother was responsible for loosing \\nGrey Wind\\n on the Freys, and was shot full of quarrels before diving into the\\nriver. An offhand comment from Jaime about killing those responsible makes the Freys drop their smug attitude\\nabout the act.\\nContent that he has taken \\nRiverrun\\n without having to take up arms against the \\nTullys\\n or \\nStarks\\n, Jaime later agrees to\\nallow Ser \\nDesmond Grell\\n and Ser \\nRobin Ryger\\n to \\ntake the black\\n, commanding \\nRaff the Sweetling\\n to escort them to\\nMaidenpool\\n. During Lord Emmon\\'s speech to the people of Riverrun, Jaime speaks with the singer he took from\\nRyman Frey earlier.

To this, Archmaester Marwyn reveals how\\nfickle and treacherous prophecy can be, but he is still intrigued. He makes it clear to Sam that Maester Aemon may\\nhave been killed by the archmaesters had he spoken his mind to them. When Sam inquires why, Marwyn replies,\\n\"Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? The world the Citadel is building has no place in it\\nfor sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons.

Illyrio explains that Tyrion and a sellsword called \\nGriff\\n will meet \\nDaenerys\\n in \\nVolantis\\n, while he remains\\nto \"smooth the way\" for them in Pentos. Illyrio tells Tyrion that Daenerys has need of cunning men such as him, but\\nTyrion is suspicious: why does Illyrio have a stake in helping Daenerys claim the \\nIron Throne\\n? Instead of\\nanswering, the merchant tells of how when he first met her, Daenerys was young and fearful and her brother \\nViserys\\nwas foolish and greedy, and Mopatis had to post guards on her door to prevent her brother from \"undoing years of\\nplanning\" by entering her chambers and raping her before she was given to Khal \\nDrogo\\n. He recounts how the meek\\nlittle girl he knew was reborn in the Dothraki sea as a true Targaryen, before turning to Slaver\\'s Bay, conquering\\nAstapor\\n, cowing \\nYunkai\\n and sacking \\nMeereen\\n. He now expects her to make her way to Volantis - where she will\\nmeet Tyrion and Griff with enough forces to carry her to \\nWesteros\\n.\\nTyrion presses Illyrio, wanting to know why a slaver city like Volantis and a man such as Illyrio would want to\\nassist Daenerys, and he says that her brother promised him the position of \\nMaster of Coin\\n and the castle of his\\nchoice. Tyrion also demands to know how he is friends with \\nVarys\\n, and Illyrio tells him that the two of them were\\nthieves together in Pentos - with Varys spying on and stealing from other thieves, then passing them on to Illyrio,\\nwho would return the goods to their rightful owners for a fee. Varys trained a network of spies - young boys and\\ngirls - to steal information, and eventually the two of them became influential enough that Illyrio was able to marry\\nthe daughter of the cousin of the Prince of Pentos, and Varys was sought by \\nAerys the Mad\\n in his paranoia for the\\npost of \\nMaster of Whisperers\\n.\\nOver several more days\\' travel through \\nAndalos\\n, Illyrio tells Tyrion that he has managed to persuade the \\nGolden\\nCompany\\n to break their contract with \\nMyr\\n and instead accompany Daenerys.

After Tyrion recounts the story\\nof \\nHugor of the Hill\\n, he tells Illyrio that he had originally intended to become \\nHigh Septon\\n before he met and\\nmarried \\nTysha\\n.

Stannis silences them and\\norders Jon to explain his reasons. Jon explains several things; firstly, unless Stannis wins \\nMors Umber\\n (who is\\noffering an alliance in exchange for certain conditions, namely the skull of \\nMance Rayder\\n and a pardon for his\\nbrother \\nHother Umber\\n, who is fighting under duress for the Boltons) to his cause, Umber will cut Stannis\\'s host to\\npieces as it crosses his land. Second, the Dreadfort will learn of Stannis\\'s coming long before his arrival and Jon,\\nhaving seen the castle\\'s defences, knows that a small garrison could hold the Dreadfort against many times their\\nnumber. Thirdly, with the imminent fall of \\nMoat Cailin\\n to \\nHouse Bolton\\n, the combined armies of Ramsay and \\nRoose\\nBolton\\n will outnumber Stannis 5 to 1, and will easily destroy him as he lays siege to the Dreadfort. In addition, the\\nnorthern lords Stannis seeks to rally to his cause, who have suffered generations of wildings raiding their holdings,\\nwill not be pleased to see his wildling conscripts crossing their lands.\\nStannis orders everyone out of the room except Melisandre and Jon. Stannis again offers \\nWinterfell\\n to Jon, but Jon\\nreminds him that Sansa is currently the rightful heir and that he cannot forsake his vows. Stannis says he plans to\\ngive Winterfell to \\nArnolf Karstark\\n, and Jon rebuts that the Karstarks abandoned his brother \\nRobb Stark\\n. Robb had\\npersonally beheaded Lord \\nRickard Karstark\\n after the latter killed two of Stark\\'s prisoners. Jon promises a source of\\nmore men to Stannis, if Stannis will let him keep the wildlings to occupy more of the forts at the Wall. Stannis\\nagrees and Jon tells him of the petty lords of the mountains - \\nHouse Flint\\n, \\nHouse Wull\\n, \\nHouse Norrey\\n, and \\nHouse\\nLiddle\\n. Jon counsels Stannis to march through the mountains, win the mountain clans to his side, then emerge to\\nattack \\nDeepwood Motte\\n and defeat the Ironmen to rouse the north to his side.

In his dream, they are one and the same. He wakes up\\nwith his mouth dry and rusty with the taste of blood and his heart hammering in his chest.\\nTyrion learns that after being knocked overboard during the battle with the \\nstone men\\n, he was rescued by \\nJon\\nConnington\\n and \\nthe prince\\n forbade the crew to throw him, near-dead, overboard. Tyrion is being treated with\\nvinegar, to reduce the danger of an infection with \\ngreyscale\\n. Prince Aegon is also still aboard and irritated about it;\\nhowever, his companions insisted on keeping him safe, as \\nSelhorys\\n, where the \\nShy Maid\\n is currently docked, fears\\nan imminent attack by an approaching \\nDothraki\\n \\nkhalasar\\n and they do not want to get caught up in the chaos. To pass\\nthe time, Tyrion goads Aegon into playing a game of \\ncyvasse\\n with him, using it as an opportunity to probe the boy\\nfor information. Aegon asks Tyrion about his \\nreal father\\n, but Tyrion can tell him little; he himself only saw Rhaegar\\nonce or twice before \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n, and was a small boy hidden away at \\nCasterly Rock\\n when Rhaegar died at\\nthe Trident\\n.\\nTyrion learns from Aegon that the child murdered by \\nGregor Clegane\\n during the \\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n was a\\ntanner\\'s son\\n from \\nPisswater Bend\\n whom Varys purchased and substituted for Aegon in the cradle. After the Sack,\\nVarys smuggled the baby Aegon across the \\nnarrow sea\\n to \\nIllyrio Mopatis\\n, who made the arrangements for Aegon\\'s\\nupbringing. Tyrion jokes that it will make a good story for the singers when he returns to Westeros, assuming\\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n takes him as her consort. Aegon is stunned by this, having clearly never considered the\\npossibility that Daenerys might refuse him. Tyrion points out that she is a proud, strong, and fierce young woman\\nwho is unlikely to appreciate a relative coming to her with a begging bowl, certainly not one with a stronger claim to\\nthe \\nIron Throne\\n than her own. Aegon angrily denies being a beggar, pointing out his own army, the \\nGolden\\nCompany\\n. Tyrion responds that Daenerys has a larger army than his own and owes nothing to Aegon. Aegon\\nprotests, trusting in Lord Connington to win her over. Tyrion calls him a fool, and gives him the following warning:\\nTrust no one, my prince. Not your \\nchainless maester\\n, not your false father, not the gallant \\nDuck\\n or the lovely\\nLemore\\n nor these other fine friends who grew you up from a bean. Above all, trust not the cheesemonger, nor\\nthe Spider, nor this little dragon queen you mean to marry. All this mistrust will sour your stomach and keep\\nyou awake at night, ’tis true, but better that than the long sleep that does not end.\\nTyrion then suggests a different course of action to Aegon: head to Westeros instead of going east, land in \\nDorne\\nand take advantage of all the problems caused by the \\nWar of the Five Kings\\n. He points out that the \\nNorth\\n is in a\\nchaotic condition, the \\nriverlands\\n are devastated, while \\nStannis Baratheon\\n holds \\nStorm\\'s End\\n and \\nDragonstone\\n. The\\ncoming winter will starve out the realm. He then paints the opposition as particularly weak: King \\nTommen\\nBaratheon\\n is just a boy, and all his potential regents come with their own problems. \\nJaime Lannister\\n actively avoids\\nthe responsibility of ruling, and \\nKevan Lannister\\n is a born follower- he will only take the rule if it is offered to him.\\nMace Tyrell\\n will have to fight the Lannisters to become regent, and Stannis\\' unpopularity makes him an unlikely\\nchoice. That leaves only one potential candidate: \\nCersei\\n. Tyrion is particularly scathing of his sister\\'s ability to rule,\\ncomparing her to some of the worst Targaryen kings, noting that Cersei, in her paranoia and impatience, will undo\\nall the alliances his father created to secure Tommen\\'s hold on the Iron Throne and adds that if Aegon acts quickly,\\nhe can take advantage of the chaos and make serious gains before Cersei is overthrown and someone more\\n\\ncompetent takes her place.\\nWhen Aegon protests, asking how they can win without his aunt and her \\ndragons\\n, Tyrion points out that he doesn\\'t\\nhave to conquer the Seven Kingdoms; he only needs to start winning victories, acting not as a beggar, but a true\\nscion of \\nHouse Targaryen\\n, like his ancestor \\nAegon the Conqueror\\n. When he does, word of it will get back to\\nDaenerys, and she and Aegon can meet as equals. Tyrion is convinced that Daenerys will fly to Aegon\\'s side and\\nimmediately love him, as he is the last of her line, and she is above all a \"rescuer\".\\nTo re-emphasize his point to Aegon about trusting no one if he wants to survive in the game of thrones, Tyrion wins\\nthe cyvasse game using a piece of bad advice he gave and which the prince took at the start of the game. Aegon does\\nnot take his loss well; the sudden burst of anger convinces Tyrion the boy \\nmight be a Targaryen after all\\n.\\nLater that evening,Haldon takes Tyrion into Selhorys in search of information, where they confirm the rumors that\\nDaenerys still has not left Meereen. They need to know more, so Haldon takes Tyrion into an inn where they bribe a\\ncustoms officer. \\nQavo Nogarys\\n, to learn more. They learn many things, such as the fact the rulers of \\nYunkai\\n are\\nspreading slanderous propaganda and offering heavy bribes to convince \\nVolantis\\n to side with them against\\nDaenerys, whose attack on the slave trade has made her enemies in Volantis. By contrast, it is learned that the red\\npriests of \\nR\\'hllor\\n, particularly the High Priest \\nBenerro\\n are supporting Daenerys, and preach Volantis\\'s destruction if\\nthe city\\'s rulers side against her, along with other apocalyptic prophecies. There are also rumors of Khal \\nPono\\n\\'s\\nkhalasar\\n approaching the city, though they are confident they can, as usual, buy off the Dothraki.\\nLater, Tyrion convinces Haldon to let him find a brothel and goes searching for \\nTysha\\n. He finds his way into a cheap\\nbrothel where he fucks a Westerosi looking girl, retches, fucks her again and then leaves ashamed of himself. On his\\nway out, he stumbles drunkenly into a \\nWesterosi man\\n who takes him prisoner to be \"delivered to the queen\".\\nNavigation:\\nTyrion V\\n↑\\nJon VI\\n ←\\nTyrion VI\\n→ \\nDaenerys IV\\n↓\\nTyrion VII\\n\\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 23: Daenerys IV\\nPlace(s): \\nMeereen\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys III\\n↑\\nTyrion VI\\n ←\\nDaenerys IV\\n→ \\nThe Lost Lord\\n↓\\nDaenerys V\\nThis article or section is a \\nstub\\n.

Jon Connington joined the Golden Company after his own defeat at the \\nBattle of the Bells\\n, at\\nStoney Sept\\n, when he failed to capture the then-rebel \\nRobert Baratheon\\n, seventeen years ago. It is revealed that\\nConnington was dismissed from the Golden Company for ostensibly stealing from their war chest, but in reality left\\ntheir service as part of a plan staged by Lord \\nVarys\\n to make his ignominious dismissal more forgettable. The\\nCompany was previously led by Connington\\'s close friend Toyne but now it is led by \"Homeless\" \\nHarry Strickland\\n,\\na man skilled in negotiating lucrative contracts but cowardly facing combat, in the eyes of Connington.\\nAfter presenting the young Griff as Prince Aegon Targaryen, son of the late Prince \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n, to the\\nhighest-ranking members of the Company, the officers, including Connington, voice their lack of enthusiasm for the\\ncomplicated situation. They did not anticipate that Daenerys would decide to remain in \\nMeereen\\n instead of marching\\nout to meet her enemies and joining with them. Strickland reveals that the Golden Company has received a large\\nnumber of alternative offers, including some which would involve them joining the coalition currently arrayed\\nagainst \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n. They also bemoan the constantly-changing plans of \\nIllyrio Mopatis\\n and Varys, who did\\nnot anticipate \\nViserys Targaryen\\n\\'s death or that Daenerys would go to Slaver\\'s Bay rather than \\nWesteros\\n. Seeing\\ntheir disillusionment and an opportunity to claim the Iron Throne for his own, Prince Aegon offers them an\\nalternative, earlier proposed by Tyrion: He does not wish to try to rally Daenerys and her dragons, but instead to sail\\nto Westeros with the hope of obtaining support from \\nDorne\\n in accordance with \\nDoran Martell\\n\\'s own plan for\\navenging Princess \\nElia Martell\\n.

A single survivor claims that\\nthey were alone, attempting to save \\nLady Glover\\n. But Asha’s brutal interrogation reveals their true purpose: to open\\na gate for the three thousand men coming to take Deepwood Motte.\\nAsha is unsure who is leading these men and she makes the sudden decision to try to flee for their ships instead,\\nhoping that the northmen have not burned the beached ships she left behind. She is confident, however, since she\\nalways beaches half her ships and leaves the other half out at sea with orders to move to \\nSea Dragon Point\\n if they are\\nattacked.\\nOn the way back to the ships, Asha realizes that it is dangerous to speed through the thick woods at night and they\\ncannot light torches or else attract attention and an attack from the northmen. She decides to rest with her men and\\nwait for sunrise in order to flee more quickly and safely. The northmen catch up to them, however, and a bloody,\\nconfusing battle ensues. Asha observes that the northmen are wearing shrubs and trees and thinks to herself that it is\\nas if the very woods were attacking them. The battle continues with Asha fighting back to back with Qarl. Amidst\\nthe confusion, she loses him and is eventually hit in the head with an axe by a northman.\\nNavigation:\\nThe Kraken\\'s Daughter\\nA Feast for Crows\\n↑\\nThe Windblown\\n ←\\nThe Wayward Bride\\n→ \\nTyrion VII\\n↓\\nThe King\\'s Prize\\n\\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 27: Tyrion VII\\nPlace(s): \\nVolantis\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTyrion VI\\n↑\\nThe Wayward Bride\\n ←\\nTyrion VII\\n→ \\nJon VI\\n↓\\nTyrion VIII\\nSynopsis\\nTyrion\\n and his captor arrive at \\nVolantis\\n, where Tyrion is put in chains so he will be taken for a \\nslave\\n and thus no one\\nwill listen to or help him.

He passes his time chatting to the guards, gaining a few favours in the form of\\ncandles, books, paper & a quill, as well as learning a little more about the general history of the north. Davos writes\\na few letters to his sons to be delivered upon his death. It is then that \\nRobett Glover\\n appears at his door and politely\\nasks him to follow; Davos is wary but notes his mannerisms and follows.\\nHe is led through secret hallways always going in different directions, passing the old godswood on the way.\\nEventually they end up in a room of the \\nNew Castle\\n where Lord \\nWyman Manderly\\n is waiting for him. He declines\\nthe offers of food and wine; Lord Wyman though, apologizes for his poor treatment of Davos. Wyman tells him that\\nthey must talk fast, as the \\nFreys\\n wait above, and Davos can hear the sounds of music and chatter above. Lord\\nWyman says that they must act quickly for Davos is \"dead\" and his head sits upon the Seal Gate. A criminal similar\\nin appearance to Davos was executed in his place, his head and hands (with fingers carefully shortened) mounted on\\nthe wall. He then learns that Lord Wyman Manderly only plays along with the Freys because he has to, as his son\\nWylis Manderly\\n is being held hostage, though he drinks for his safe return.\\nDavos says he was quite convinced by Wyman\\'s daughters\\' behaviour, though he was confused by \\nWylla Manderly\\n.\\nWyman responds that his young granddaughter was extremely brave to have said those things. There was truth in\\nher words as the debt the \\nManderlys\\n owe the \\nStarks\\n and \\nWinterfell\\n can never be repaid. He adds though that he\\ncannot show any sign of contempt to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n for fear of the harm they might do to his son. \\nTywin Lannister\\ntold Wyman that he must confess his treason, yield White Harbor, declare his loyalty to \\nKing Tommen\\n, and bend his\\nknee to \\nRoose Bolton\\n. If he refused, Wylis would be killed as a traitor, White Harbor would be sacked and his\\npeople would \"suffer the same fates as the \\nReynes\\n of Castamere\". If he complies, his son will be released. By\\n\"killing\" Davos, he has proved his loyalty to the Iron Throne and assured the release of Wylis, which Davos notes is\\na brave move.\\nWyman adds that he has been unable to send Stannis more information in his letters because the Freys infest his\\ncourt, looking for any sign of treachery and his \\nmaester\\n \\nTheomore\\n is \\na distant cousin to the Lannisters\\n, so Manderly\\ndoes not trust him. Manderly goes on to add his rage at his son \\nWendel Manderly\\n\\'s death at the hands of the Freys,\\ncalling it murder and the Freys\\' claims fables. He tells Davos that the \\nNorth\\n remembers and his son is home,\\nmeaning that his act for the Freys is almost over as well.\\nHe then summons \\nTheon\\n\\'s mute squire \\nWex\\n, who survived the \\nSack of Winterfell\\n. Davos is told by Robett that\\nTheon was captured at Winterfell, and is currently being flayed by the Boltons. He adds that all the women were\\nalso captured and marched away. Davos listens to the horrible things that \\nRamsay Bolton\\n does to the captured\\nwomen, sending them naked into the woods with half a day\\'s head start before hunting them down with his dogs.\\nEvery so often, according to Manderly, some wench lives to tell the tale, but most aren\\'t as lucky. If caught, they are\\nraped, flayed and their corpses fed to his dogs, while their skins adorn the \\nDreadfort\\n. If he considered them good\\nsport, he slits their throats before he flays them, otherwise it is the other way around.\\nRobett tells a stunned Davos that the evil is in Ramsay\\'s blood, sired from rape. Wyman adds that the Freys are no\\nbetter than Ramsay. He also tells Davos that Roose lies and played a darker part in the \\nRed Wedding\\n than he has\\nadmitted. In addition, Davos is told that the Boltons and Freys know the northmen are not expected to believe their\\n\\nlies but will be forced to accept them or else die as well.\\nHe tells Davos about the mighty fleet he has built up, which Davos saw when he entered the port. Furthermore he\\nhas plenty of silver in his vaults and has more heavy horse than anyone else north of \\nThe Neck\\n. Wyman states that\\nOldcastle\\n and \\nWidow\\'s Watch\\n will follow his lead, all of the lands east of the \\nWhite Knife\\n, from Widow’s Watch\\nand \\nRamsgate\\n to the \\nSheepshead Hills\\n and the headwaters of the \\nBroken Branch\\n will be pledged to \\nStannis\\nBaratheon\\n if Davos meets his one price. He says he does not need a king but a smuggler. He needs Davos to\\nsmuggle home \\nRickon Stark\\n, his true liege, and one who holds a stronger claim than \\nArya\\n, who is soon to be wed to\\nRamsay Bolton.\\nThe true story about what happened at Winterfell comes out then; Wex hid in the godswood, and \\nRodrik Cassel\\n was\\nmurdered by Ramsay Bolton. Wex also says that six survived the siege, two of them the sons of \\nEddard Stark\\n. Four\\nof the people went north and two went another way. Manderly insists that they must have the boy and his \\ndirewolf\\nas proof of his identity should the Boltons try to deny him. Wyman asks Wex to show them where they went and he\\nthrows a dagger at the spot on the map. Davos looks long at where the dagger has landed, pondering whether it\\nwould be better to go back to the dungeons and eat porridge for breakfast as it is better than \\nplaces where men break\\nfast upon human flesh instead\\n.\\nNavigation:\\nDavos III\\n↑\\nJon VI\\n ←\\nDavos IV\\n→ \\nDaenerys V\\n\\nA Dance with Dragons - Chapter 30: Daenerys V\\nPlace(s): \\nMeereen\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys IV\\n↑\\nDavos IV\\n ←\\nDaenerys V\\n→ \\nMelisandre\\n↓\\nDaenerys VI\\nSynopsis\\nDaenerys\\n begins every morning my counting the enemy ships in the harbour.

She has had her betrothed followed and \\nSkahaz mo\\nKandaq\\n reports that Hizdahr has visited eleven pyramids and it has been twenty-six days since a murder has been\\nattempted. He surmises that he must be one of the \\nSons of the Harpy\\n or else these others would not have listened to\\nhis words alone. Skahaz asks that he may question Hizdahr, but Dany will not let him, stating that she must trust in\\nHizdahr or face open rebellion in the city. Skahaz also advises her that the fleets in the blockade all have family\\nmembers in \\nMeereen\\n and that she should use them as hostages, a contemplation she also rejects. \\nBarristan Selmy\\nadvises her that she has done a wise thing.\\nGrey Worm\\n meets with her next to tell her that the first refugees from \\nAstapor\\n are arriving in Meereen and that\\nAstapor is burning. Dany learns of \\nthe fall of Astapor\\n, and that many inhabitants have contracted the \\nbloody flux\\nwhile under siege, with the survivors now fleeing towards Meereen. The survivors also say that they believed and\\nwaited everyday for Daenerys to come and save them. She tells them that they will be safe in Meereen now. Dany is\\nadvised not to let the survivors and their illness into the city, and reminded again of \\nEroeh\\n and of how sometimes\\nthose whom she tries to save end up worse off.\\nThere are further appeals to use the dragons, however they are followed with comments that they cannot be\\ncontrolled right now, and even the \\nUnsullied\\n are afraid to go into the dragon pit to feed them. Dany says she cannot\\nand will not unleash the dragons at this point in time. Ultimately she decides not to let the Astapori into the city and\\nthat they should have a separate camp outside the city until the flux passes.\\nSer Barristan appeals to her to take the battle to the enemy. She then reminds herself that a queen represents her\\npeople and not just her own person. She thus decides that she cannot have the Unsullied take the field or else she\\nwould have to leave the \\nBrazen Beasts\\n alone to defend against the Sons of the Harpy which will not suffice.

When she looks for Stannis,\\nshe sees eyeless faces staring out, crying blood. Then she sees towers by the sea followed by skulls rising out of the\\nocean turning to mist and great winged beasts flying in the sky.

Melisandre knows and sees that \\nDavos\\n is the most loyal to \\nStannis\\n thus she has\\nkept Devan back against the young boy\\'s wishes. She knows that Davos has lost too many sons already and although\\nStannis has ridden out, she keeps the boy in order to save one of Davos\\' sons.\\nMelisandre does not sleep much, often just an hour a night, as she fears to dream and what she sees there, re-\\noccurring images of the words \"Lot Seven\" and \"Melony\".\\nShe sends Devan to go get \\nRattleshirt\\n and bring him to her. She speaks with him and tells him to keep his bones on,\\nin order to keep the \\nglamor\\n spell active. She also asks that he go and fetch the girl she saw on the dying horse. She\\ntells him of her vision and asks him where the girl might be coming up, and, knowing the North well, he can guess\\nher location, west of \\nLong Lake\\n. Their talk is disrupted by the single long drone of a horn, marking the return of the\\nrangers.

He knows that Ramsay has been forced to restrain his violent outbursts in \\nBarrowton\\n as he needs\\nthe loyalty of the \\nDustins\\n and \\nRyswells\\n, but what he does behind closed doors is none of their concern. Ramsay then\\nthrows a severed head for Theon to catch, which he cannot because of his maimed hands. He does not recognize the\\nhead as it is covered in blood, rotting, and bursting with maggots.\\nTheon is then ordered to put away the men\\'s horses. He is followed by \\nBig Walder Frey\\n, who, Theon notes, does not\\ntake after his older cousin in the malicious ways of the flayed men. Theon asks Big Walder who the man\\'s head\\nbelonged to, and he replies it was just an old man who called Ramsay \"Lord Snow.\"\\nThen there is a feast, and Theon is chained to the wall and waits his turn to eat, though the dogs provide the night\\'s\\nentertainment fighting each other for scraps. Theon remembers when Ramsay told him that \\nall the dogs\\n are named\\nafter peasant girls he hunted, raped, flayed, and killed. He notes the next litter will likely include a \\nKyra\\n. It is then\\nthat \\nRoose Bolton\\n enters the hall with some of his men. Here it is discovered what happened to the Frey men and\\nwhy they were searching. The Freys rode ahead of the procession of the \\nManderlys\\n. Wyman Manderly stopped\\nfrequently to feast, but the Freys rode on and disappeared. Roose says that \\nHosteen Frey\\n and \\nAenys Frey\\n are\\ndistressed, but Ramsay says it is of no concern, as there are plenty of Frey men at \\nthe Twins\\n.\\nRamsay and Roose argue; Roose says that his son is acting brash and foolish and drawing attention to himself with\\nhis cruel and barbaric amusements, that his fore-bears were no fools. He notes that they have powerful allies in the\\nFreys and the \\nLannisters\\n, but the northmen despise them and only accept \\nHouse Bolton\\n\\'s authority grudgingly (with\\nonly the exception of Lady \\nBarbrey Dustin\\n, whose support Ramsay would cast aside because she hates him; Roose\\npoints out that Lady Dustin was fond of his late son, \\nDomeric Bolton\\n, and holds Ramsay responsible for his death).\\nThey talk briefly about the dead sons of the \\nStarks\\n, and what might happen if they were to \"return\" from the dead;\\nRoose angrily chides his son for openly discussing his part in the \\nSack of Winterfell\\n, pointing out that their northern\\nvassals would turn on them in an instant if they learned the truth. Roose then changes the subject by informing\\nRamsay that \\nStannis\\n has marched from the Wall, adding that it is not towards the intended trap at the \\nDreadfort\\n that\\nthe \\nKarstarks\\n baited, thus revealing that the Karstarks are double-crossing Stannis.\\nRoose tells Ramsay he is to wed \\nthe fake Arya Stark\\n not in Barrowton, but in \\nWinterfell\\n. By doing so, the clansmen\\nwho follow Stannis will be incensed to march on the keep, something they would not do while the Boltons are in\\nBarrowton; once Stannis lays siege to Winterfell, Arnolf will turn on him there. Roose then takes Theon away from\\nRamsay. Ramsay tells Theon to observe everything and report back to him, but he is to say nothing about his\\ntreatment to Roose.\\nAs they ride to \\nBarrow Hall\\n, Roose tells Theon he knows what his bastard son has asked of him. He goes on to say\\nthat he knows what the real \\nReek\\n was like, the opposite of what Ramsay has turned Theon into. He notes that he\\nprovided the first Reek as a servant to the unruly young Ramsay; he had intended it to be a cruel joke, but is now\\nuncertain whether Reek corrupted Ramsay or the other way around. Ramsay was the child of a rape, one that Roose\\n\\nis not proud of; he chanced upon the beautiful young wife of an old miller while out hunting and decided to practice\\nthe illicit tradition of the \\nfirst night\\n, having the miller hanged and then taking the man\\'s wife. The woman showed up\\nat the Dreadfort a year later with baby Ramsay; Roose had intended to have the woman whipped and the infant\\nthrown down a well, but when he saw the child had his eyes, Roose stayed his hand and agreed to aid them- he gave\\nthe woman back the farm her husband\\'s brother had stolen from her, had the man\\'s tongue cut out to stop him telling\\ntales to \\nRickard Stark\\n, Roose\\'s liege, and periodically sent the woman a few pigs, chickens and coin to help bring up\\nthe bastard child on the condition she never tell the boy who his father was. He thinks that the woman may have had\\na hand in turning Ramsay on to desiring goals outside the rights of a bastard. They also discuss Domeric Bolton,\\nRoose\\'s true-born son, whom Roose suspects was killed by Ramsay. He also suspects that any trueborn sons he has\\nwith his \\nnew wife\\n Ramsay will likely kill, though he admits this might be best, as he believes he will not live long\\nenough to raise new sons to manhood and considers child lords the bane of a House.\\nThey finally arrive at Barrow Hall, where Theon is brought to Barbrey Dustin, Lady of Barrowton. He is introduced\\nas Theon Greyjoy, true Lord of the Iron Islands, which frightens Theon into fits, having been tortured into calling\\nhimself Reek. She asks Roose if Theon has gone mad, and he replies he most likely has, but it doesn\\'t matter.

Jon asks for a favour: to borrow ships and a loan to keep the \\nNight\\'s Watch\\n fed until\\nspring. Tycho says this is impossible, but after a few hours of drinking and haggling they strike a deal.\\nWith the three ships added to the Eastwatch fleet, Jon counts that they now have eleven ships.

She also learns the truth about her father\\'s execution from Jon and is\\nunsurprised to learn that Robb killed him for murdering prisoners in a fit of rage; her father was a brooding man, and\\nher uncles are no better.\\nAlys asks Jon if there is still a blood-feud between them after the death of her father, but he assures her that men of\\nthe Night\\'s Watch hold no grudges.

Jaime chides the \\nBracken\\n man saying that they were once an enemy of the king when they sided with\\nthe \\nStarks\\n, and keeping his head is more than enough compensation for what the \\nMountain\\n did to his lands. Bracken\\nprotests that he will keep faith with the crown as he did with the Starks; Jonos adds that a dozen good men of his\\ndied at the \\nRed Wedding\\n with \\nRobb Stark\\n and he bent the knee because he saw no point in fighting on for a lost\\ncause. Jaime remarks that Lord Jonos is a prudent man on hearing this, yet privately thinks Blackwood might be\\nconsidered more honorable.\\nJaime then goes to parley with \\nTytos Blackwood\\n. Inside he sees the castle\\'s massive \\nweirwood\\n tree from which the\\ncastle derives its name; the tree is black and leafless. Tytos tells Jaime that it is the fault of the Brackens, poisoned\\nand barren for a thousand years, and in another thousand it will turn to stone as weirwoods never rot. As they treat,\\nJaime tells him that he does not have to physically kneel to him. They agree to a confession, fealty, pardon, and\\nfinancial sum as well as lands. Finally they discuss the matter of a hostage, and Jaime asks for \\nBethany\\n, his\\ndaughter, but Tytos refuses as she is his only daughter.

He claims that the Second Sons were troubled when they learned\\nthat Daenerys could not use her dragons to help fight the Yunkish forces. After he leaves, she asks Ser \\nBarristan\\nSelmy\\n his opinion, as he was hiding and listening as always. He advises her that Brown Plumm is quite truthful, and\\nconfirms that it is not wise to place trust in a sellsword.\\nSeeking ways to make up for the loss of the Second Sons, Dany asks Ser Barristan about the possibility of finding a\\nrival leader in the group that might want to \"remove\" Brown Ben Plumm. Barristan thinks it possible, but doesn\\'t\\nknow for certain.

She introduces Quentyn to \\nViserion\\n and \\nRhaegal\\n, telling him that\\nDrogon\\n is away hunting, and that she is a dragon as well.

The \\ntaking of Griffin\\'s Roost\\n was quite easy; the Golden\\nCompany only lost four men in the attack. Any raven trying to leave the castle was shot down, followed shortly by\\nthe castle\\'s \\nmaester\\n being thrown from his tower. After that, what was left of the garrison surrendered.\\nTaking his leave of the Golden Company officers by claiming to be going to pray at his father\\'s tomb in the castle\\nsept, Jon instead goes to the battlements and reminisces over the time \\nRhaegar\\n visited his home and seemed\\nimpressed with Connington\\'s lands. Jon then reflects on what happened next to \\nhis House\\n; after \\nAerys\\n exiled Jon,\\nfurious at his failure to stop Robert, the lands and title went to his cousin \\nRonald Connington\\n (who had been Jon\\'s\\ncastellan while he was in \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n) but after the end of \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n, \\nKing Robert\\n stripped Ronald of\\nhis lordship and gave most of House Connington\\'s lands to houses that had fought for him. Jon, however, is glad that\\nhe will not have to fight his deceased cousin or Ronald\\'s son \\nRonnet\\n, who is away fighting in the Riverlands, to\\nreclaim Griffin\\'s Roost, not wanting to celebrate his return by killing one of his own kin. Nor does he blame his\\ncousin any longer for taking advantage of his downfall, since as far as Jon is concerned, the one responsible for\\nHouse Connington\\'s downfall is himself.\\nJon\\'s musings then turn to where he lost everything: \\nStoney Sept\\n. Taking over pursuit of Robert from the \\nTyrells\\nafter the \\nBattle of Ashford\\n, Jon cornered the rebel in the town and began searching for him. But the search yielded\\nnothing, as the townsfolk were protecting Robert, hiding him and constantly moving him. All of Connington\\'s\\nefforts to find Robert- offering bribes for information, taking hostages, threats and pardons- got him nowhere, and\\nthe delays bought time for \\nEddard Stark\\n and \\nHoster Tully\\n to bring a rebel army to Robert\\'s rescue. The rebels\\nattacked Connington\\'s men at the same time Robert and his followers emerged from the town in a counterattack, and\\nthe \\nensuing battle\\n ended in a rebel victory. For years, Jon reflects that he insisted he did all he could, until \\nMyles\\nToyne\\n disabused him of that notion by pointing out that \\nTywin Lannister\\n would have burned Stoney Sept to the\\nground to kill Robert, then offered pardons to Stark and Tully when they arrived to convince them to give up and go\\nhome. Connington, however, knew this would mean killing everyone in the town, and he both didn\\'t want to be\\nbranded a murderer and wanted the glory of slaying Robert for himself. Jon reflects that his failure at Stoney Sept\\nled to Rhaegar\\'s death at the Trident and vows not to fail Prince Aegon as he failed his father.\\nRe-joining his fellows, Jon takes note of the captives, including Ronnet\\'s brother, sister and bastard son. Most of the\\ncastle staff swear loyalty to him. Connington pays a visit to \\nHaldon\\n, who is trying to interpret where most of the\\nGolden Company, scattered along the coast by the Volantene ships that transported them from \\nEssos\\n to send a\\nmessage to \\nDoran Martell\\n to inform him that his nephew \\nAegon\\n is alive, in order to gain the Dornish alliance. Jon\\nreflects that he could not have expected loyalty from these men if he had reclaimed his home while \\nRobert\\n and\\nRenly\\n still held the Stormlands. Haldon also argues that they need to offer incentives to convince recalcitrant lords\\nto join them-as most of the gold and land will go to the Golden Company officers that was taken from their\\nancestors, Haldon suggests offering the hands of Prince Aegon and Jon himself for marriage alliances. Jon, however\\nrefuses, in the face of his illness and his insistence that Aegon must be free to wed \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n if she ever\\nreturns home. In his chambers, Jon privately treats his \\ngreyscale\\n with wine. If his condition became known, he fears\\nthat any lords still loyal to \\nHouse Connington\\n would abandon him.\\n\\nFour days later, Prince Aegon arrives along with \\nDuck\\n, the first member of his \\nKingsguard\\n. Jon recalls his\\ndisapproval of that choice and how he argued with Aegon that they should leave places in his Kingsguard open to\\nboth warriors of great renown or the younger sons of important lords to add lustre to their cause, but Aegon refused,\\nsaying all he wanted from his Kingsguard was their willingness to die defending him, pointing out that Jon\\'s criteria\\nfor the Kingsguard perfectly fits \\nthe Kingslayer\\n. Jon informs him that his men plan to take \\nStorm\\'s End\\n in ten days\\n(he had refused the suggestions of the Golden Company officers to make an alliance with \\nStannis Baratheon\\n, who\\nholds it, arguing that Stannis is Robert\\'s brother, a rival claimant to the throne and leagues away from them with\\nnothing to offer).

At first, Cersei walks with dignity,\\nignoring the insults and worse (such as rotten vegetables and a cat carcass) the crowd throw at her, but as the walk\\ncontinues and the insults grow worse, mocking her faded beauty and the signs of age on her body, Cersei struggles\\nto maintain her composure.

They decide that their word for going ahead with the plan\\nwill be \"\\nGroleo\\n,\" in reference to the hostage that was slain by the \\nYunkai\\'i\\n. Skahaz reveals that he was present in the\\nthrone room when \\nBloodbeard\\n and the slaver lords made their insult, and that he and every one of the \\nBrazen Beasts\\npresent would have killed the Yunkish delegation in an instant had Hizdahr given the command, raging that the\\nYunkish would never have dared do such a thing to Daenerys. The Shavepate goes on to explain to Ser Barristan\\nthat Hizdahr\\'s horrified reaction to Groleo\\'s severed head was a sham and the slavers couldn\\'t care less about\\nYurkhaz zo Yunzak\\n\\'s death in the pit; the whole thing was arranged so as to give Hizdahr a pretext to kill the queen\\'s\\ndragons\\n before \\nVolantis\\n\\'s fleet arrives.\\nDespite Skahaz\\'s objections, Barristan insists that after Hizdahr is deposed, they will order the Yunkai\\'i return their\\nremaining hostage and withdraw their armies from \\nMeereen\\n, only going forth to do battle if they refuse. Selmy is\\nalso confident he can overcome Hizdahr\\'s guards, as they are only pit fighters and Barristan believes men like that,\\nwho fight for the adulation of the crowd and only when they are called to, are no match for a knight of the\\nKingsguard\\n who must always be alert and ready to fight and die at a moment\\'s notice to defend their monarch.\\nBarristan and Skahaz also dispute over trying to rescue the remaining hostages—\\nJhogo\\n, \\nHero\\n and \\nDaario\\n—as the\\nShavepate believes it is too dangerous to try. He is also particularly scathing about Daario, believing it would be\\nbetter in the long run for Daenerys if the \\nStormcrows\\n\\'s captain were to die. Though he is aware Daenerys is in love\\nwith Daario, Barristan privately agrees as he is well aware from history that the \\nTargaryens\\n have a propensity for\\nchoosing poorly in matters of the heart, choices that almost always lead to disaster:\\nPrine \\nRhaegar\\n loved his Lady \\nLyanna\\n and \\nthousands died for it\\n. \\nDaemon Blackfyre\\n loved the \\nfirst Daenerys\\n,\\nand rose in \\nrebellion\\n when denied her. \\nBittersteel\\n and \\nBloodraven\\n both loved \\nShiera Seastar\\n and the Seven\\nKingdoms bled. The \\nPrince of Dragonflies\\n loved \\nJenny of Oldstones\\n so much he cast aside a crown, and\\nWesteros paid the bride price in corpses. All three of the sons of the \\nfifth Aegon\\n had wed for love in defiance of\\ntheir father\\'s wishes. And because that unlikely monarch had followed his heart when he chose his queen, he\\nallowed his sons to have their way, making bitter enemies when he might have made fast friends. Treason and\\nturmoil followed, as night follows day, ending at \\nSummerhall\\n in sorcery, fire and grief.\\nSkahaz also mentions that they have hostages of their own and that they can easily retaliate in kind if the Yunkai\\'i\\nharm any more of their hostages, but like his queen, Barristan refuses to harm the cupbearers, due to his own\\naversion to killing children. Though disappointed, the Shavepate agrees and promises that everything will be ready\\nfor the plan by nightfall.\\nFor the rest of the day, Barristan makes his rounds about \\nthe pyramid\\n and trains with his boys. He thinks to himself\\nthat some of them might be ready for \\nknighthood\\n soon. However, as he wrestles with what he is planning to do that\\nnight, he decides it would be worse for the boys if they were knighted by an knight without honour just before his\\ndeath. He lectures the boys about honor and thinks that someday maybe they will understand. He also warns\\nMissandei\\n not to leave the queen\\'s chambers, but refuses to answer her questions about his intentions. He also\\n\\nreflects on his own failures, one in particular; that he didn\\'t defeat Rhaegar at the \\ntourney at Harrenhal\\n. Had he won,\\nhe would have crowned \\nAshara Dayne\\n, who he was enamoured with, as \\nqueen of love and beauty\\n and wonders that\\nif he had, would Ashara not have killed herself from grief over a child supposedly fathered on her by \\na Stark\\n.\\nBarristan considers that his greatest failure.\\nDuring the night, after bathing and donning his armour, Ser Barristan goes to confront Hizdahr in his chambers; the\\nBrazen Beasts let him past without incident. Barristan, using the pretext of delivering a message to gain entrance,\\ntries to question Hizdahr, demanding to know if he is in league with the \\nSons of the Harpy\\n and if he had anything to\\ndo with the \\nassassination attempt\\n on Daenerys. Hizdahr\\'s denials of the accusations do not convince Selmy, and\\nwhen the old knight draws his sword, Hizdahr call for the pit fighter \\nKhrazz\\n, one of his guards, to defend him.\\nDespite Barristan\\'s efforts to convince Khrazz to surrender, the gladiator attacks him; however, Khrazz\\'s\\ninexperience of fighting opponents wearing armour is his downfall, and Selmy kills him quickly. Barristan tells\\nHizdahr, who desperately begs for his life, that he means to take Hizdahr to a cell, where he will be imprisoned until\\nDaenerys returns. Suddenly, a \\ncup bearer\\n informs them that \\nReznak\\n wishes to see the king.

Missandei asks what is to be done with\\nQuentyn\\'s body and Barristan replies that they will find a way to send him back to \\nDorne\\n, though he is unsure how.\\nHe advises Missandei to get some sleep and she urges him to do the same as she has noted that he doesn\\'t sleep very\\nmuch. Barristan privately thinks it is not just needing less sleep than a younger man, as \\nGrand Maester\\n \\nPycelle\\n once\\ntold him, but having reached the age where he fears to close his eyes in case he never opens them again; Barristan\\ndoes not consider dying in his sleep a death worthy of a knight of the \\nKingsguard\\n. For a brief moment, he wonders if\\nDaenerys is dead, but then dismisses the thought, though he notes that each time it becomes harder to convince\\nhimself his queen is still alive.\\nAt dawn, \\nSkahaz mo Kandaq\\n comes to speak with him; Skahaz is already aware that Quentyn is dead, and he\\ninforms Barristan that the \\nGreen Grace\\n, who Barristan sent to treat with the \\nYunkai\\'i\\n to make them release the\\nhostages, has not returned to the city. In addition, while the city is secure, an angry mob is gathered outside the\\npyramid demanding \\nHizdahr\\n\\'s release and that both dragons be destroyed, and since his arrest, the \\nSons of the Harpy\\nhave resumed their nightly murders with a vengeance; Barristan is shocked to learn they have killed twenty nine in\\nthe night, in contrast to nine the previous night and three the night before. However, despite Skahaz\\'s insistence,\\nBarristan still refuses to kill the hostages in retaliation.\\nThe Shavepate tells Barristan (who is now the Queen\\'s \\nHand\\n, as head of a council ruling the city) that the council is\\nwaiting for him. Barristan does not want the position, but in the absence of Daenerys, he doesn\\'t trust any of the\\nothers to rule. \\nGrey Worm\\n and the captains of the \\nStalwart Shields\\n, \\nMother\\'s Men\\n and \\nFree Brothers\\n, along with\\nStrong Belwas\\n are present. Barristan informs them of Quentyn\\'s death; most of the council express contempt for the\\nprince\\'s actions and many want his companions, who are at present imprisoned, executed for unleashing the dragons\\non the city. The fighting pits are to remain closed, for fear that the noise and smell of blood will attract the dragons,\\nthough \\nMarselen\\n suggests reopening the pits in the hope it lures \\nDrogon\\n back, and Daenerys with him. For the time\\nbeing, the pits are packed full of livestock, from which the dragons are feeding regularly, and thus far, there has\\nbeen no further evidence of either Viserion or Rhaegal eating people.\\nThe council are convinced that the Yunkai\\'i are never going to accept any terms beside the killing of both dragons\\nfor the return of the hostages. When asked what he will do when his terms are refused, Barristan replies \"Fire and\\nBlood\". They quickly grasp his meaning; he intends to do battle with the Yunkish army. A lengthy discussion\\nregarding the battle plan follows, particularly regarding the deployment of troops, targets to attack, how best to use\\nthe \\nUnsullied\\n and other such concerns; however, all agree that if they can destroy the slavers, the \\nsellsword\\ncompanies will abandon their paymasters, and the dragons may make their presence known in the fight, though\\nBarristan cannot say if they will help or just kill indiscriminately, though he does note that if they come, it will help\\n\\nbreak Yunkish morale.\\nWhen the council adjourns, Barristan goes to the cell where the two Dornishmen are being held and informs them of\\nPrince Quentyn\\'s death. \\nGerris Drinkwater\\n angrily blames Daenerys for it, causing a fierce argument between him\\nand Barristan, who bluntly dismisses Gerris\\'s claims Quentyn came for love and asserts they came because\\nQuentyn\\'s father\\n wanted the backing of \\nHouse Targaryen\\n before daring to defy the \\nIron Throne\\n, but \\nArchibald\\nYronwood\\n angrily tells Gerris to shut up before more can be said. Barristan then makes an arrangement with the two\\nDornishmen\\n; in exchange for a ship back to Dorne and Quentyn\\'s bones to return to his father, Barristan wants them\\nto go back to the \\nWindblown\\n company and tell the \\nTattered Prince\\n that they will give him what he wants (namely\\nPentos\\n) if he can free and protect the hostages during the attack.\\nThe Green Grace returns, telling Barristan that the Yunkai\\'i have refused his offer, and that the only price they will\\naccept is the death of the dragons.

The lord of \\nGriffin\\'s Roost\\n, \\nRonnet Connington\\nstands before them, insisting that he is loyal to King Tommen and uninvolved with whoever claims to be his uncle\\nJon Connington\\n and the \\nTargaryen\\n pretender he has brought with him, who have landed with the \\nGolden Company\\nin the \\nStormlands\\n, attacking towns and villages as they march on \\nStorm\\'s End\\n.

Tyrell insists that he will deal with Connington and his boy after Margaery\\'s trial, but\\nboth he and Tarly show much reluctance about it; Kevan however chides them. Tyrell then asks why Tommen can\\'t\\ndeclare Margaery\\'s innocence without a trial, but Kevan insists that defying the Faith will send them straight into the\\narms of Connington or \\nStannis Baratheon\\n at a time when the \\nIronborn\\n are attacking the Western lands as well. Mace\\nTyrell retorts that \\nPaxter Redwyne\\n will drive the Ironmen back and that Stannis has to face both \\nRoose Bolton\\n and\\nthe cold climate of the North. He also dismisses the threat Jon Connington and the exiles of the \\nGolden Company\\npose but Kevan is unsure; he still remembers when \\nAerys\\n appointed Connington to the role of Hand, and while\\nTywin Lannister\\n\\'s assessment of Connington as unsuitable for the post proved true after his failure to kill \\nRobert\\nBaratheon\\n at the \\nBattle of the Bells\\n, Kevan believes age has surely made Connington wiser, more cautious and more\\ndangerous.\\nThe small council all agree that Connington and his pretender must be crushed, lest \\nDaenerys Targaryen\\n receive\\nword and leave \\nMeereen\\n to join forces with them. \\nPycelle\\n suggests that they buy off the Golden Company, but new\\nMaster of Coin\\n \\nHarys Swyft\\n dismisses this idea; thanks to Cersei\\'s economic mismanagement, the treasury is nearly\\nempty, the \\nIron Bank of Braavos\\n still demanding its money, pledges for new loans from \\nMyr\\n received no favorable\\nresponse, and their hopes of replenishing the treasuries with the fabled wealth on \\nDragonstone\\n following \\nSer Loras\\'s\\ncapture of the island have proven in vain. Mace Tyrell reacts angrily to that, arguing that Loras searched the castle\\nand found no trace of gold or gemstones, nor the fabled cache of \\ndragon eggs\\n supposedly kept there; Kevan\\npersonally thinks that Loras didn\\'t look very hard, given that he is a young man prone to rash judgments, even more\\nso following his injuries, and the \\nValyrian\\n sorcery used to construct Dragonstone likely hides many secrets, but\\nKevan defuses the argument by suggesting Stannis likely took everything of value with him when he fled. Kevan\\nalso suggests that Harys try \\nPentoshi\\n \\nmagister\\n moneylenders, or else go to Braavos and deal with the Iron Bank in\\nperson.\\nNext, business turns to the forthcoming trials; Kevan says that Cersei has chosen \\ntrial by battle\\n, with Ser \\nRobert\\nStrong\\n to represent her as her champion. Tyrell and Tarly express deep misgivings about the man, which Kevan\\nshares as they have all heard rumours: \\nMeryn Trant\\n says he has never seen Strong eat or drink, and \\nBoros Blount\\nclaims to have never seen him use the privy. Kevan muses that \\n\"Dead men don\\'t shit\"\\n, suspecting that he and the\\nothers know \\nwho Strong really is\\n. However, Kevan silences Mace\\'s protests by arguing that if Cersei loses her trial,\\nthe legitimacy of her children, and thus Margaery\\'s claim to the throne as Tommen\\'s queen will be called into\\nquestion. He also assures the council that even if Cersei proves her innocence, she will be sent back to \\nCasterly\\nRock\\n afterwards, and play no further part in ruling or Tommen\\'s education.\\n\\nThe meeting adjourns, intending to reconvene in five days\\' time and leaving for later decisions about an inheritance\\ninvolving \\nHouse Rosby\\n and six claims, as well as the preparation for \\nMyrcella\\n\\'s upcoming marriage. Mace Tyrell\\nmakes plain his scorn for the marriage, particularly after Myrcella\\'s injuries, and suggests a better match for her;\\nKevan muses that Mace likely has his son \\nWillas\\n in mind. He dismisses the idea, warning that reneging on\\nMyrcella\\'s betrothal now could be all the cause \\nDoran Martell\\n needs to side with Connington. Harys Swyft suggests\\nthat they get the Dornish to deal with Connington and his pretender; Kevan agrees that it would save them a lot of\\ntrouble. After Tyrell and Tarly are gone, Pycelle asks Kevan for guards, fearing that Mace Tyrell means to do him\\nharm for his part in Cersei\\'s claims about Margaery, but Kevan dismisses his concerns.\\nIt is snowing heavily in King\\'s Landing and Kevan retires to his study for a time to warm up. He muses on the\\npossibility of raising his son \\nLancel\\n to the Kingsguard to end his newfound piety, before his thoughts turn to Cersei,\\nthe charming and sweet girl once was; he believes that, had Aerys accepted Tywin\\'s offer and wed his son to Cersei,\\nRhaegar\\n would never have looked twice at \\nLyanna Stark\\n, and perhaps many now dead would still be alive. He then\\nthinks on Cersei\\'s \\nwalk of shame\\n and how similar it was to what Tywin did to their \\nfather\\'s\\n \\nmistress\\n, but Kevan\\nreassures himself it was necessary; the Faith had to be appeased, and left unchecked, Cersei would have corrupted\\nTommen as she did \\nJoffrey\\n.\\nKevan then goes to Cersei\\'s chambers, where he has dinner with her and Tommen. Cersei is very calm and guarded\\nafter her walk of atonement, which Kevan thinks a good sign. She makes a humble request that \\nTaena Merryweather\\nattend on her once more after the trial and that her son be brought to court as a companion for Tommen; she also\\nasks after her brothers, but Kevan has no news of Jaime or Tyrion. He also says that he has imprisoned the\\nremaining Kettleblack brothers for their crimes of fornicating with a Queen; if they confess, he will send them to the\\nWall. If not, they will face Robert Strong.\\nA messenger then announces that Grand Maester Pycelle is asking for Kevan\\'s presence. Kevan arrives at the\\nMaester\\'s chambers and enters to find a \\nwhite raven\\n sitting on the window ledge, a sign from the \\nCitadel\\n that winter\\nhas come. Kevan turns to leave, and is hit in the chest by a crossbow bolt. He calls out for help, but then sees Pycelle\\nsat at his table, already dead. For one moment, Kevan calls out to \\nTyrion\\n, thinking his nephew responsible, but a\\nfamiliar voice tells him otherwise as the real killer emerges: \\nVarys\\n. Varys explains to the dying Kevan that he bears\\nthe man no ill will, that Kevan is simply a good man in service to a bad cause, but he was becoming too successful\\nin uniting the realm behind Tommen and undoing the damage Cersei had caused. The eunuch adds that Cersei will\\nsuspect the Tyrells (with help from the Imp) for Kevan\\'s murder, the Tyrells will blame her, someone will blame the\\nDornish and the alliances shoring up Tommen\\'s hold on the \\nIron Throne\\n will crumble as \\nAegon\\n makes his presence\\nknown at Storm\\'s End and the realm flocks to the side of the Targaryens.\\nKevan insists that Aegon was killed during the \\nSack of King\\'s Landing\\n but Varys explains otherwise; that Aegon has\\nbeen groomed since birth to be king, taught not just in skill at arms and ruling, but how to look after himself, what it\\nmeans to go hungry, to be hunted and most importantly, that it is his \\nduty\\n to rule, not his right, and to put his people\\nfirst. Varys then summons some of his \"\\nlittle birds\\n\" and instructs them to finish the dying Kevan off.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys X\\n ←\\nEpilogue'"

Viserys\\nwishes to win back \\nhis father\\'s\\n \\nthrone\\n and is in need of an army, which he hopes to acquire by making a \\nmarriage\\nalliance with a \\nDothraki\\n \\nkhal\\n who leads a large \\nkhalasar\\n.\\nViserys presents Daenerys with a gift from Magister Illyrio, a fine silk dress. Daenerys has to look like the princess\\nshe is, so Khal \\nDrogo\\n will ask for her hand in marriage. Although Daenerys is doubtful of Illyrio\\'s motives, Viserys\\ninsists that the Magister simply wants to earn his good graces. Afraid of angering her brother (which he calls\\n\"waking the \\ndragon\\n\"), Daenerys keeps silent about her mistrust. Viserys warns Daenerys not to fail him, and twists\\none of her niples to emphasize his threat. According to Viserys, when history of his reign is written, it will be said\\nthat his reign began that night.\\nViserys departs, leaving Daenerys alone with her thoughts. She dreads the feast she has to attend that evening, and\\nher mind wanders to \\nWesteros\\n, the homeland she has never seen. She had been conceived shortly before her mother,\\nQueen \\nRhaella Targaryen\\n, fled \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n with Viserys, and born nine months later on \\nDragonstone\\n. Yet she\\nknows the stories Viserys has told her, the flight from King\\'s Landing to Dragonstone; Her eldest brother, \\nRhaegar\\nTargaryen\\n \\nfighting\\n \\nRobert Baratheon\\n and dying; The \\nSack of King’s Landing\\n, the gruesome death of Prince \\nAegon\\nTargaryen\\n, and the murder of her father, King \\nAerys II Targaryen\\n, in the throne room, committed by \\na knight\\n of his\\nown \\nKingsguard\\n. Nine months after the deaths of her brother and father, Daenerys\\'s mother died giving birth to her\\n(something for which Viserys has never forgiven her), during a summer storm which destroyed most of the\\nTargaryen\\n fleet which had been Dragonstone\\'s last defense. When the garrison of Dragonstone was wiling to give\\nViserys and Daenerys over to \\nStannis', ' old man with a staff are following them. When a merchant hands her\\na beautiful box as a gift, Dany opens it to find a green scarab within. The creature within the box flies out, and\\nmayhem erupts. The creature would have bit Dany had the old man with the staff not knocked it out of her hands.\\nThe merchant was a \\nSorrowful Man\\n, and the creature a \\nmanticore\\n that would have killed Dany had it bitten her.\\nThey learn that the huge, scarred eunuch is the pit-fighter Strong \\nBelwas\\n, and the old man is his squire \\nArstan\\nWhitebeard\\n, both sent by Magister \\nIllyrio Mopatis\\n to return them to \\nPentos\\n. The old man recognizes Mormont, and\\nthe exile recognizes him but cannot place a name. Arstan claims he comes from the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n, and squired\\nfor a knight of \\nHouse Swann\\n as a young man. The two claim that Illyrio sent for them because he wishes to have her\\ndragons in order to bring justice to the Seven Kingdoms, which are a divided and warring realm. Dany concedes that\\nshe must leave Qarth, but commands them to change the names of their three ships to that of Aegon’s three dragons.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys IV\\n↑\\nSansa VII\\n ←\\nDaenerys V\\n→ \\nArya X\\n↓\\nA Storm of Swords\\nDaenerys I\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 64: Arya X\\nPlace(s): \\nHarrenhal\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nArya IX\\n↑\\nDaenerys V\\n ←\\nArya X\\n→ \\nSansa VIII\\n↓\\nA Storm of Swords\\nArya I\\nSynopsis\\nAfter aiding in the capture of \\nHarrenhal\\n \\nArya\\n is now serving Lord \\nRoose Bolton\\n.

The Freys believe that Robb will lose, and\\nthat they should sue for peace and leave Harrenhal. Bolton states that he is not a man to be undone, like \\nStannis\\nBaratheon\\n was. Arya learns that \\nWinterfell\\n has fallen and is horrified when she finds out that her brothers are dead.\\nBolton dismisses the Freys, and has Arya remove the leeches.\\nQyburn\\n reads a letter from the Lady \\nWalda\\n, Bolton’s new wife.

That\\nevening, Bolton returns with nine dead wolves, and tells Arya that he means to give Harrenhal to \\nVargo Hoat\\n when\\nhe returns to the north. Arya is to remain at Harrenhal to serve the Goat. Outside the tower occupied by the Freys,\\nshe hears much shouting within and sees \\nElmar\\n crying on the steps. The young son of Lord \\nWalder Frey\\n says,\\n\"We’ve been dishonored. There was a bird from the Twins.

On her way she will see\\nvisions of the past, future and days that never were, and those that will speak to her from other rooms, but she must\\nnot enter any room and keep her path until she reaches the Undying\\'s audience chamber.\\nAt the entrance, Daenerys drinks a glass of \\nshade of the evening\\n a dwarf gives her, to prepare her for the truths\\nwithin, and enters. In the House of the Undying, she notices right away that she is in the presence of sorcery.\\nFortunately, she brought \\nDrogon\\n with her into the Warlocks\\' home. Daenerys sees a great many visions during her\\njourney through the halls:\\n1\\n. \\nA beautiful naked woman sprawling on a floor with four little men with rat-like faces raping her.\\n2\\n. \\nA feast of corpses, a room full of savagely slaughtered bodies, and many of the corpses have cups or spoons in\\ntheir hands; above them sits a dead man on a throne with the head of a wolf, wearing an iron crown and holding\\na leg of lamb like a king would hold a scepter;\\n3\\n. \\nold, dead, loyal Ser \\nWillem Darry\\n beckons her into the house with the \\nred door\\n, in \\nBraavos\\n4\\n. \\nAn old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says \"Let him be\\nthe king of ashes\";\\n5\\n. \\na \\nman\\n who looks like \\nViserys\\n, but taller and with darker eyes, who says to a \\nwoman\\n nursing a baby, \"\\nAegon\\n…\\nWhat better name for a King… He is the Prince that was Promised, and his is the song of ice and fire\"; and\\nwhen the man’s eyes meet Dany’s, he says either to her or the woman with the baby, \"There must be one\\nmore… The dragon has three heads\", and he picks up a silver harp and begins to play;\\n6\\n. \\na vision of Pyat Pree telling her the visit is over, and to follow him into a garden;\\n7\\n. \\na great hall with several robed people claiming to be the Undying \\nQarth\\n, who tell her, \"We sent the comet to\\nshow you the way (to Qarth)… shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?\", but it turns out to be\\nsorcery.\\nFinally, Daenerys comes upon a room with several figures that are no more than shadows, unbreathing, and over\\nthem floats a human heart, blue and corrupted (these are apparently the real Undying). The figures speak inside\\nDany’s head:\\nwe know… the shape of shadows… morrows not yet made… drink from the cup of ice… drink from the cup of\\nfire… Mother of Dragons… Child of Three… three heads has the dragon… three fires must you light: one for\\nlife and one for death and one to love… three mounts must you ride: one to bed and one to dread and one to\\nlove… three treasons will you know: once for blood and once for gold and once for love… daughter of death,\\n\\nslayer of lies, bride of fire…\\nShe now sees visions in her head, floating faster and faster:\\n1\\n. \\nViserys\\n dying;\\n2\\n. \\na tall lord with copper skin and silver hair bearing the banner of a fiery stallion;\\n3\\n. \\na dying prince with rubies flying from his armor whispering the name of a woman with his last breath;\\n4\\n. \\na blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who casts no shadow;\\n5\\n. \\na cloth dragon amidst a cheering crowd;\\n6\\n. \\na great stone beast flying from a smoking tower, breathing shadow fire;\\n7\\n. \\nher Silver horse given to her by \\nDrogo\\n at her wedding;\\n8\\n. \\na corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, smiling sadly;\\n9\\n. \\na blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice;\\n10\\n. \\nshadows dancing in a tent;\\n11\\n. \\na little girl running toward a house with a red door;\\n12\\n. \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n shrieking in', \"Robert Baratheon\\n, strong as a bull,\\nfearless in battle and loving war, who killed her brother \\nRhaegar Targaryen\\n, and his dogs: \\nEddard Stark\\n, \\nTywin\\nLannister\\n and \\nJaime Lannister\\n. How will she overthrow them? Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys, who\\nwas a fool, believed the realm would rise for their rightful king. She then decides that the \\nBleeding Star\\n has led her\\nto Qarth for a purpose, and if the gods intend for her to conquer they will send a sign.\\nNear eveningfall, \\nIrri\\n brings word that Ser Jorah has returned. He enters with \\nQuhuru Mo\\n, captain of the \\nCinnamon\\nWind\\n out of \\nTall Trees Town\\n. Daenerys has her dragons all around her. He has the news that Robert Baratheon is\\ndead, reported in \\nOldtown\\n, \\nDorne\\n and \\nLys\\n.

Jorah does not think it likely that Eddard is\\na traitor, saying the long summer will come again before he besmirches his honor. Daenerys wonders if her brother\\nwould have been wiser had he known that vengeance was so close at hand. When asked, the captain replies he is not\\nreturning to \\nWesteros\\n for a year or more since his ship will sail east from Qarth, making the trader’s circle around\\nthe \\nJade Sea\\n. When Daenerys states he has brought her a precious gift, he tells her that he has been amply repaid by\\nbeing allowed to see dragons. She aks him to come to her one day in \\nKing's Landing\\n.\\nAfter the trader leaves, Ser Jorah warns Daenerys of speaking so freely. Daenerys replies that the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\nare flying to pieces like the khalasar did after Khal Drogo died. Ser Jorah tells her that she will still need gold,\\narmies, and ships. Daenerys responds that she knows this, but she is the blood of the dragon. Jorah goes on to say\\nthat King Robert killed a dragon with a warhammer.

On the steps up, he runs into \\nSam\\n before finally arriving at the King\\'s\\nTower.\\nStannis has been unsuccessful in seeking allegiance from the lords of the North; the latest rejection letter is from\\nLyanna Mormont\\n. So far, the only house to have declared for him is \\nHouse Karstark\\n. Stannis asks for gold from the\\nNight\\'s Watch to pay off \\nSalladhor Saan\\n. Jon recommends he take \\nWhite Harbor\\n for that, but Stannis dismisses its\\nlord, \\nWyman Manderly\\n, as fat and useless. With \\nwildling\\n refugees still seeking shelter south of the wall, they\\ndiscuss \\nMance Rayder\\n, whom Stannis intends to burn as a deserter, his wife\\'s sister \\nVal\\n, and his child.

Stannis approves once he learns that Gilly\\'s child was born of incest.\\nStannis is demanding lands and castles from the Night\\'s Watch.

Lord Florent\\nis a defeated man, and he tells Davos that his nephew \\nImry\\n died with the fleet, and that most of Stannis’ bannermen\\nwere captured at the battle and bent the knee to \\nJoffrey\\n. He is now condemned as a traitor for writing a letter he\\nplanned to send to Lord \\nTywin\\n, offering peace and suggesting that Stannis would swear fealty to Joffrey but would\\nremain Lord of Dragonstone and \\nStorm\\'s End\\n, and that the Florents would get \\nBrightwater Keep\\n back.

In order to pay the slave masters, Daenerys offers all three of her ships as well as\\nDrogon\\n, for the price of a dragon is incalculable. Daenerys frees \\nMissandei\\n and takes her into her service, revealing\\nthat she can speak \\nHigh', ' reminder that Benjen Stark remains First Ranger until\\nhis death is confirmed. Once Smallwood is gone, Mormont exclaims that he would sooner name Sam as First\\nRanger and complains that Smallwood called him too old for a ranging.\\nBrusquely examining the maps, Mormont asks if they were all Sam could find. When Sam stutters, Jon points out\\nthat the villages might be gone, but the geography will still be correct. Mormont asks Sam about the ravens and\\n\\ncommands that he wants the best, saying that if they are all butchered he means for his successor to know where and\\nhow. Talk of butchery leaves Sam open-mouthed and speechless. Mormont declares he is too busy for such behavior\\nand dismisses Sam, who almost trips in his haste to leave.\\nMormont asks, without waiting for an answer, whether Sam is as big a fool as he seems. He explains that he was\\nconsidering sending Sam as an envoy to King Renly, since his \\nfather\\n stands high in Renly’s councils, but Renly is\\nnot likely to heed a quaking fat boy so Ser \\nArnell\\n (whose mother was a \\ngreen-apple Fossoway\\n) will go instead. Jon\\nasks what Mormont would have of King Renly, and Mormont replies that he will take anything that is offered.\\nMormont continues that Ser Alliser Thorne should reach King \\nJoffrey\\n soon, but \\nHouse Lannister\\n has never been a\\nfriend to the Watch. Jon points out that Thorne does have the twitching \\nwight\\n’s hand to show them. Mormont\\nlaments they do not have a second hand to send to Renly. Jon remarks that \\nDywen\\n claims a man can find anything\\nbeyond the Wall. Mormont scoffs that Dywen also claims he saw a bear fifteen feet tall, insisting a man must\\nbelieve his own eyes.\\nTurning the conversation back to hands, Mormont asks Jon about his burned hand. Jon explains it is well enough to\\nwield \\nLongclaw\\n and that he is exercising the fingers as Maester Aemon suggested. Mormont opines that Aemon\\nknows his work and prays they can keep him another twenty years. Then he asks if Jon knows that Aemon could\\nhave been king. Jon is taken by surprise; he assumed the maester was a younger son of a king.\\nMormont explains that Aemon \\nwas\\n a younger son, the third son of King \\nMaekar I Targaryen\\n, who was himself the\\nfourth son of King \\nDaeron II Targaryen\\n. Slow of sword but quick of wit, Aemon was sent to the Citadel when he\\nwas nine or ten and ninth or tenth in the succession. Jon struggles to imagine the 100-year-old maester as a little boy.\\nMormont continues that Crown Prince \\nBaelor\\n died in a \\ntourney\\n mishap and soon after his two sons, \\nValarr\\n and\\nMatarys\\n died in the \\nGreat Spring Sickness\\n along with King Daeron, so the crown passed to Daeron’s second son,\\nAerys I Targaryen\\n. Aerys reigned for twelve years (during which Aemon took his vows as a maester) then died\\nwithout issue and the throne passed to Aemon’s father Maekar I. During his father’s reign, Aemon’s eldest brother,\\nDaeron \"the Drunken\"\\n, died of a pox, leaving only \\na feeble-minded daughter\\n, and his second brother, \\nAerion\\nTargaryen\\n, who killed himself by drinking \\nwildfire\\n, believing it would turn him into a \\ndragon\\n. Less than a year later,\\nKing Maekar died in battle with an outlaw lord.\\nA \\nGreat Council\\n was convened to decide on the succession. It passed over Aerion’s infant son and quietly offered\\nthe throne to Maester Aemon, but Aemon chose to abide by his vows even after the \\nHigh Septon\\n offered to absolve\\nhim. Therefore, his younger brother, \\nAegon V Targaryen\\n, was named king, and became known as \"the Unlikely\"\\nbecause (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that\\nthose dissatisfied with his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so', \" fears\\nfor her sister. Robert confides that he thinks Jon’s death has driven Lysa mad and that she has taken \\nher son\\n back to\\nthe \\nEyrie\\n. Robert had hoped to foster the sickly boy with \\nTywin Lannister\\n, but Lysa refused to hear of it and left in\\nthe dead of night; Cersei was furious. Ned, who does not trust Tywin, is relieved. Ned asks to foster Robert Arryn\\nhimself, but Tywin has already agreed and Ned taking him as a ward would be an insult to Tywin.\\nNed comments that Robert should visit \\nthe Wall\\n, but Robert responds that he has more important concerns such as\\nreplacing Lord Arryn, who held several important positions such as \\nWarden of the East\\n. Ned reminds Robert that\\nthat title traditionally goes with the domain of \\nHouse Arryn\\n but Robert declares that he will not appoint six-year-old\\nRobert Arryn as \\nWarden of the East\\n. Ned reminds Robert that during times of peace the title is only an honor. The\\nking is not pleased--the son is not the father, though maybe when the boy is grown the title will be given back.\\nRobert mentions that he also needs a new \\nHand of the King\\n and offers the position to Ned so they can work together\\nagain. Then Robert tells Ned how the responsibilities bore him and complains that he is surrounded by flatterers and\\nfools. He insists that he wants Ned to come south to \\nKing's Landing\\n to be Hand of the King, the second most\\nimportant man in the kingdom.\\n\\nNed does not want the position and tries to declare himself unworthy of the honor. Robert only jokes that he is not\\ntrying to honor Ned but to get him to run the kingdom for him, relating the low-born saying that “the King eats and\\nthe Hand takes the shit.” Robert asks for at least a smile, but Ned replies that it is said to be so cold in the North that\\na man's laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death.\\nKing Robert also offers to marry his son, the Crown Prince Joffrey, to Ned's eleven-year-old daughter \\nSansa Stark\\n to\\njoin the Houses of Stark and Baratheon as he and Lyanna were supposed to. Ned hesitates to make this decision,\\nwishing to speak to his wife, but Robert asks him not to take too long.

After some of the lords give Catelyn reassurance that Winterfell is safe, Lord\\nRoose Bolton\\n states that it is rumored she holds \\nTyrion Lannister\\n, who would be a good hostage. Catelyn admits she\\nlost the dwarf because the gods saw fit to free him with help from \\nher sister\\n. Speaking of Lysa, Catelyn recalls that\\nbefore leaving the \\nEyrie\\n, she attempted to convince her sister to let her take \\nRobert Arryn\\n as a fosterling, but Lysa’s\\nrage had been frightening.\\nCatelyn then sends the bannermen and Theon away to speak to Robb alone. Once they are gone, Catelyn notes that\\nher son looks older, especially with his new beard. Catelyn, who is afraid for her son, notes to Robb that he is only\\nfifteen and leading a host to war. Robb insists that there was no one else. Catelyn argues that he could have given\\ncommand to any of the bannermen, or even Theon, although he would not have been her choice. Robb responds that\\nnone of them are Starks. Catelyn then reminds Robb that he was fighting with wooden swords less than a year ago.\\nRobb’s eyes flare with anger, but he softens and asks if she is sending him back to Winterfell. Catelyn explains that\\nshe cannot do such a thing; if she did, the bannermen would lose respect for him, which would hurt him when he\\n\\nbecomes Lord of Winterfell one day. Robb’s relief is obvious.\\nRobb asks if Catelyn knows about Lord Eddard's capture and she says she does; \\nRobert\\n's sudden death and Eddard’s\\nfall scared her greatly. Catelyn asks about the girls and Robb tells her that letters addressed to each of them from\\nSansa\\n arrived at Winterfell. Robb returns with a crumpled parchment and hands it to her. She reads it with concern\\ngiving way to disbelief, then to anger, and then to fear. She exclaims that it is \\nCersei’s\\n letter, and that they have\\nSansa hostage and mean to keep her. Robb points out that there is no mention of \\nArya\\n and that he was hoping that\\nCatelyn still held Tyrion to exchange for his sisters.\\nRobb then asks about the knights of \\nthe Vale\\n and is told that Lysa will do nothing; only one knight of the Vale will\\nride to war: the best, Ser Brynden Tully. Robb asks Catelyn what they are going to do with the 18,000 men he does\\nhave. Catelyn can tell that Robb is caught in indecision, which will not do. Knowing he is worried about his father\\nand sisters, Catelyn explains to her son that if he goes to \\nKing's Landing\\n to bend the knee he will never be allowed\\nto leave, and if he retreats to Winterfell his lords will lose respect for him. In either case, Cersei can then do as she\\nlikes to her captives without fear. Their only hope is that Robb can defeat the \\nLannisters\\n in the field; Cersei cannot\\nharm her captives because she will need them as hostages if things go against her. However, if Robb loses there is\\nno hope for any of them and they will suffer the fate of the \\nTargaryen children\\n; there is naught but stone at the heart\\nof \\nCasterly Rock\\n. Robb states that that makes it simple: he will not lose.\\nCatelyn then asks about the situation in the \\nRiverlands\\n. Robb informs her that \\nthe war\\n has begun. A fortnight past,\\nSer \\nJaime Lannister\\n \\nsmashed\\n the \\nTully\\n force led by Lords \\nVance\\n and \\nPiper\\n at the \\nGolden Tooth\\n and is now\\nadvancing on \\nRiverrun\\n.

The \\nraven\\n arrived that morning, and Catelyn is beside herself with grief, despondent at the thought\\nnearly all her children are dead or lost to her. She tells Brienne that she sent \\nthe Kingslayer\\n a bottle of \\nwine\\n to loosen\\nhis tongue. She means to question him, and is perhaps contemplating having the man killed since she has so little to\\nlive for anymore.\\nAt midnight, Catelyn goes to interrogate Jaime, and asks Brienne to wait outside. Jaime mocks her at first, but\\neventually agrees to answer her questions if she agrees to answer his. Jaime admits to being the father to all of\\nCersei\\n’s children, and to throwing \\nBran\\n out the tower window. However, Jaime denies sending the assassin after\\nBran, saying, \"if I wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself.\" Catelyn questions him about the dagger\\nthat \\nLittlefinger\\n claimed \\nTyrion\\n had won from him. Jaime backs what Tyrion told her in the \\nMountains of the Moon\\n,\\nthat he always bets on his brother and lost at that tourney. Jaime admits that King \\nRobert\\n mocked him with the\\ndagger at the feast the night of the tourney, and Catelyn is dismayed that Littlefinger, who was like a brother to her\\nonce, would deceive her the way he has.\\nCatelyn then reveals that \\nRobb\\n has recently taken \\nthe Crag\\n from the \\nWesterlings\\n, and marched ever closer to\\nCasterly Rock\\n. Jaime then steers the conversation to what really happened to \\nBrandon Stark\\n and Lord \\nRickard\\n at the\\nhands of the Mad King \\nAerys\\n, perhaps to absolve himself of having slain the king. Brandon was on his way to\\nRiverrun when he learned of \\nLyanna\\n\\'s disappearance, and instead went to \\nKing\\'s Landing\\n with a handful of friends,\\nall sons of prominent lords, and upon entering the \\nRed Keep\\n, Brandon shouted for \\nRhaegar\\n to \"come out and die\".\\nRhaegar was not there to answer the challenge, and Aerys had Brandon and his men arrested for conspiring to\\nmurder his heir. Aerys demanded the fathers of the men come to King’s Landing to answer the charges against their\\nsons; when they came, both fathers and sons were murdered at the command of King Aerys, with Brandon dying of\\nstrangulation trying to reach his father who was being burnt alive by Aerys\\' pyromancers. Jaime was a young\\nmember of the \\nKingsguard\\n when he saw all this, and it was Ser \\nGerold Hightower\\n who told him, \"You swore a vow\\nto guard the king, not to judge him\", whom everyone consider a better man than him.\\nJaime, now fully drunk, angrily rants that he is reviled for what he considers his finest act and begins to mock \\nNed\\nStark\\n’s honor, stating that unlike Ned, a man who fathered \\na bastard\\n, he has never been unfaithful and that Ned had\\nno right to judge him, the man who avenged his father and brother, but Catelyn has heard enough, and calls for\\nBrienne’s sword.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn VI\\n↑\\nTyrion XII\\n ←\\nCatelyn VII\\n→ \\nTheon V\\n↓\\n\\nA Storm of Swords\\nCatelyn I\\n\\nA Clash of Kings - Chapter 56: Theon V\\nPlace(s): \\nWinterfell\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nTheon IV\\n↑\\nCatelyn VII\\n ←\\nTheon V\\n→ \\nSansa V\\n↓\\nTheon VI\\nTheon Greyjoy\\n is awoken by \\nWex Pyke\\n and \\nReek\\n and informed of the arrival of his sister, \\nAsha\\n.

Theon refuses to abandon his conquered seat, after which Asha leaves. As a last measure, Theon sends\\nReek away with', \" outside and opens the window, explaining that the sound seems to be good for Bran.\\nWhen the other direwolves join in, Catelyn screams for Robb to make the noise stop and then collapses to the floor.\\nRobb helps her up but she only begins screaming again. Then Robb notices the dogs barking as well and sees the\\nlibrary tower afire.\\nWhile Robb rushes off to fight the fire, Catelyn remains behind with Bran. When she turns away from the window,\\nhowever, she is face-to-face with \\na filthy man\\n brandishing \\na knife\\n. The man claims that Catelyn was not supposed to\\nbe there and moves towards Bran, claiming that killing him would be a mercy. Catelyn attempts to scream for help,\\nbut the man is too quick as he moves to slit her throat. Catelyn manages to grab the blade with her hands and push it\\naway, cutting her fingers badly. She bites the man's hand and fights her way free. The man is about to attack her\\nagain when Bran's direwolf leaps onto him and rips out his throat. Once the man is dead, the direwolf settles down\\non Bran's bed.\\nCatelyn is taken back to her chambers. \\nOld Nan\\n undresses her and helps her into a bath. After the bath, Maester\\nLuwin dresses Catelyn's wounds: her fingers are cut almost to the bone and the man had pulled out a handful of hair.\\nThe maester gives her milk of the poppy, which puts her to sleep. She wakes up four days later. It seems like a\\nnightmare, but the pain in her hands reminds her that it was real. When Catelyn remembers her behavior since Bran's\\nfall she is ashamed, promising herself that it will not happen again.\\nRobb, now wearing armor and a sword, comes to see her with \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n, Ser \\nRodrik Cassel\\n, and \\nHallis Mollen\\n,\\nthe new \\ncaptain of the guard\\n. Hal tells her that nobody knows who the man was, but he had likely been lurking in the\\nstables since the king's visit. Where the man had been hiding they found ninety \\nsilver stags\\n hidden under the straw.\\nWhen Robb asks why anybody would want to kill Bran, Catelyn insists that as a \\nlord\\n he must learn to answer his\\nown questions. Robb guesses that somebody is afraid of what Bran might do or say if he wakes up and so posts a\\n\\nheavy guard on Bran.\\nRodrik points out that the dagger used by the assassin, a \\nValyrian steel\\n blade with a \\ndragonbone\\n handle, is a much\\nfiner weapon than anything the low-born footpad should have possessed; someone must have given it to him.\\nCatelyn then tells Rodrik, Theon, and Robb in strict confidence of her sister \\nLysa's\\n suspicions about the death of \\nJon\\nArryn\\n. She reminds them that \\nJaime Lannister\\n did not go hunting with the others the day Bran fell, and that she does\\nnot believe that Bran fell, but that he was pushed. The group admits that this is a reasonable conclusion.\\nHowever, Maester Luwin points out that all they have is conjecture, and that they must have proof or else keep\\nsilent.

The council\\nargues for hours about which way to march and which king to support until \\nGreatjon Umber\\n gives a rousing speech\\nand the bannermen proclaim Robb the \\nKing in the North\\n.\\nSynopsis\\nTo \\nCatelyn\\n, it seems a thousand years since she left \\nRiverrun\\n by boat with an infant \\nRobb\\n to head north to \\nWinterfell\\nfor the first time. Now she is returning by boat across the \\nsame river\\n with a son who wears plate and mail instead of\\nswaddling clothes. With them in the boat is \\nTheon Greyjoy\\n, and in the boat following are \\nBrynden Tully\\n, \\nGreatjon\\nUmber\\n, and \\nRickard Karstark\\n.\\nAs they draw near, the men on the walls cheer them as the banners of \\nHouse Tully\\n fly from every rampart, but\\nCatelyn cannot feel anything but sadness since she received news of \\nher husband\\n’s death, and she wonders if her\\nheart will ever lift again. After passing under the wall through the wide Water Gate, they are greeted on the water\\nstair by Catelyn’s brother Ser \\nEdmure Tully\\n and Lord \\nTytos Blackwood\\n. A worn-looking Edmure embraces Catelyn,\\nexpresses his condolences, and promises vengeance against the \\nLannisters\\n. Catelyn only says that it will not bring\\nNed back, then states she has to see \\nher father\\n.\\nShe is escorted to her father’s solar in the keep, which is three-sided like Riverrun itself. Along the way, Catelyn\\nasks about her father, and--as expected--Edmure explains that he is dying. When Catelyn demands to know why she\\nwas not notified, Edmure explains that with the \\nSeven Kingdoms\\n so volatile their father forbid it; if word had gotten\\nout that he was ailing, the Lannisters might have attacked. Catelyn immediately blames herself, remembering it was\\nshe who sparked the war by \\narresting\\n \\nTyrion Lannister\\n.\\nThe solar is also triangular with a balcony to the east from which the walls, battlements, and river fork can be seen.\\nLord Hoster’s bed has been moved onto the balcony so he can sit in the sun and watch the rivers. He is shrunken,\\nlooking much older and frailer than Catelyn remembers. Lord Hoster calls her “Little Cat” and tells how he wanted\\nto be awake when she arrived; he was afraid he would not wake again. He speaks weakly and is wracked by spasms\\nof pain. He defends his decision to keep news of his illness a secret, but admits that he was afraid he would die\\nbefore seeing her again, especially once the siege began. She tells him that Robb is here, they have \\nJaime Lannister\\nin irons, and Riverrun is free again. This leads Lord Hoster to tell her of the joy he had as he watched the \\nbattle\\n from\\nthe battlements.\\nHer father asks if it was Robb who won the battle and Catelyn tells him that it was. Then she mentions that Ser\\nBrynden was also an important figure. Lord Hoster seems surprised by the mention of the Blackfish and asks if \\nLysa\\nhas come down from the \\nVale\\n as well. Catelyn cannot lie and explains that Lysa is frightened and believes she and\\nher son are only safe in the \\nEyrie\\n. Hoster is very disappointed that he will not see her.\\nLord Hoster agrees to see Robb, who he remembers has his Tully eyes. When Catelyn presses on to ask if he will\\n\\nsee his brother, her father asks if Ser Brynden has married anyone yet. Catelyn is saddened that her father cannot\\nallow the old feud to rest. She tells him that his brother has not wed, nor will he ever. Lord Hoster launches into a\\nweak rant, criticizing Brynden’s choice to defy him and never marry, saying that \\nBethany Redwyne\\n is still waiting\\nfor Brynden. Catelyn has to remind her father that Bethany Redwyne has long ago married Lord \\nMathis Rowan\\n and\\nhas three children. Her father states there were also offers from others, including Lord \\nJonos Bracken\\n’s daughter or', \" states that\\nMya has never failed him, and so Catelyn agrees to the night ascent.\\nMya Stone guides Catelyn up the long path to the Eyrie in the dark, claiming that torches only blind one on a clear\\nnight. Mya then tells Catelyn that \\nMychel Redfort\\n, a squire she loves, says she has the eyes of an owl. Catelyn\\nknows that, because his family is highborn, the squire will never be allowed to marry a \\nbastard\\n.\\nAt each way-tower they switch to fresh mules. The trip to the first way-tower does not seem too bad, but the next\\npart is much steeper. At the next way-tower Mya explains that it is called Snow because, hundreds of years ago, this\\nwas where the snow began. At first Catelyn thinks that, as a Tully and a Stark, there is little in the world to scare her.\\nHowever, when they must lead the mules across a high saddle between to spires of rock, Catelyn finds that she is too\\nscared to move. Mya comes back and escorts her, blind and trembling, step by step across. At Sky, Mya explains\\nthat they must walk the last hour because the trail is more like a stone ladder. Catelyn states that, having travelled all\\nday and the best part of a night, she will ride with the turnips instead.\\nCatelyn finds the Eyrie, which can house 500 men, strangely empty. She is brought to her sister’s quarters. Lysa,\\nnow a plump, pale, and (to Catelyn’s annoyance) well-rested woman, is polite until Ser \\nVardis Egen\\n and Maester\\nColemon depart. Then she rages at Catelyn for bringing Tyrion to the Eyrie, and thus dragging her into Catelyn’s\\nquarrel with the Lannisters. Catelyn replies that it was Lysa who sent her the letter naming the Lannisters as the\\nmurderers of her husband. Lysa responds that it was a warning to avoid them, not fight them.\\nRoused by his mother’s voice, young Lord Robert appears in the door, grasping a doll. Lysa introduces Catelyn to\\nRobert and calls him a beautiful and strong child, warning Catelyn not to believe the stories. Lysa insists that on his\\n\\ndeathbed her husband said “the seed is strong” to let everyone know what a strong boy his son was. Catelyn attempts\\nto bring back the subject of preparing for war, but Lysa insists that Catelyn be quiet because such talk will scare\\nRobert. Lysa then exposes her breast and the six-year-old grabs for it and starts to suck.\\nThe sight makes Catelyn think of her youngest son \\nRickon\\n, who is half this boy’s age and five times as fierce.\\nCatelyn continues to press Lysa to discuss preparations for war. Lysa replies that even if the Lannisters could bring\\nan army up, everyone says the Eyrie is impregnable. Catelyn realizes that her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her\\nabout Lysa. Lysa then asks what she is supposed to do with Tyrion and Robert asks if he is a bad man. When Lysa\\nreplies that he is, Robert says, “Make him fly.” Lysa strokes the boy’s hair and muses that perhaps that is just what\\nthey will do.\\nNavigation:\\nCatelyn V\\n↑\\nEddard VIII\\n ←\\nCatelyn VI\\n→ \\nEddard IX\\n↓\\nCatelyn VII\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 35: Eddard IX\\nPlace(s): \\nKing's Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard VIII\\n↑\\nCatelyn VI\\n ←\\nEddard IX\\n→ \\nDaenerys IV\\n↓\\nEddard X\\nLittlefinger\\n leads \\nNed\\n to the \\nbrothel\\n that \\nJon Arryn\\n visited.

       "The downfall of House Stark was the result of a series of key events and decisions made by its members, particularly Eddard Stark, Catelyn Stark, and Robb Stark. Here are the pivotal moments and actions that contributed to their decline:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Eddard Stark's Honor and Political Maneuvering**:\n",
       "   - Eddard Stark's rigid sense of honor led him to reject Cersei Lannister's offer to flee King's Landing after discovering her secret about Joffrey's illegitimacy. Instead, he confronted her directly, which ultimately led to his arrest and execution.\n",
       "   - His trust in Littlefinger and failure to secure immediate support from Renly Baratheon or other allies left him vulnerable to Cersei's machinations.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Catelyn Stark's Arrest of Tyrion Lannister**:\n",
       "   - Catelyn's decision to arrest Tyrion Lannister on her way to King's Landing, based on Lysa Arryn's letter accusing the Lannisters of Jon Arryn's murder, escalated tensions between House Stark and House Lannister.\n",
       "   - This act provoked Tywin Lannister into sending forces into the Riverlands, sparking open warfare and drawing the Starks into a larger conflict.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Robb Stark's Military Campaigns and Political Decisions**:\n",
       "   - Robb's successful military campaigns initially bolstered House Stark's position, but his decision to be crowned \"King in the North\" alienated potential allies who might have supported him as a Stark loyal to the Iron Throne.\n",
       "   - His failure to secure a strategic marriage alliance (breaking his promise to marry a Frey) led to the Red Wedding, where he, his mother, and many of his bannermen were betrayed and slaughtered by the Freys and Boltons.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **The Red Wedding**:\n",
       "   - The betrayal at the Red Wedding, orchestrated by Tywin Lannister, Roose Bolton, and Walder Frey, was the final blow to House Stark. Robb, Catelyn, and much of their army were killed, effectively dismantling House Stark's military and political power.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Bran and Rickon's Presumed Deaths**:\n",
       "   - Theon Greyjoy's betrayal and the apparent deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark (later revealed to be a ruse) further weakened House Stark by removing the remaining heirs and destabilizing their hold on the North.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Sansa and Arya's Captivity**:\n",
       "   - Sansa's captivity in King's Landing and Arya's flight from the capital left the Stark children scattered and vulnerable, removing potential future leaders for the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "These events, driven by a mix of honor, mistrust, and strategic missteps, culminated in the near-total destruction of House Stark. The actions of Eddard, Catelyn, and Robb, while often well-intentioned, ultimately played into the hands of their enemies, particularly the Lannisters."

As he fades off to sleep, he asks Ned if he will\\ndream and Ned assures him he will. Then Robert declares that he will give Ned’s love to \\nLyanna\\n. Last of all, Robert\\nrequests that Ned guard his children. Unable to tell the truth and unable to lie, all that Ned can think of is Robert’s\\nbastards when he tells him that he will.\\nPycelle tells Ned that he has done all that he can, but the wound has already mortified because it took two days to\\nget Robert back. When Ned asks how long, he is told that by rights the king should be dead already. Renly adds that\\nRobert was always strong, though perhaps not wise, recounting that Robert slew the boar even with his guts hanging\\nout. Ned replies admiringly that Robert was never one to leave the battle with an enemy standing.\\nSer Barristan is still standing outside and Ned tells him that the king is not to be disturbed. Ser Barristan laments that\\nhe has failed his sacred trust. Ned reassures the old knight that no one can defend a man against himself and even the\\nking blamed the wine. The knight admits that Robert was reeling drunk. \\nVarys\\n, who has just appeared, asks who\\ngave Robert all the wine, and Ser Barristan tells them it was the king’s elder squire, \\nLancel Lannister\\n. Varys states\\nthat he hopes the lad does not blame himself. Ned informs Varys that the king wants the assassination of Daenerys\\ncanceled. Varys tells him that those birds have flown but he will do what he can.\\nTomard\\n and \\nCayn\\n are helping Ned across the bridge when Renly catches up and asks for a private word. Renly asks\\nif Robert’s will makes him regent and, knowing his answer, tells Ned that he has 100 swords to offer him. Renly', \" emphasizes that it is his place, mocking him as the Sore-foot King and the\\nCart King. Viserys draws his blade, angering the Dothraki.Then he spots Daenerys and stalks over. She begs him to\\nthrow away the sword but Viserys ignores her. Viserys demands his crown or else he will take Daenerys back, but\\nhe will be happy to cut out her child and leave it for Drogo. To emphasis his point, Viserys presses his sword against\\nher belly hard enough to prick her navel through her silks.\\nJhiqui\\n is sobbing in fear, stating that she dare not translate Viserys’ words; if she does she fears Khal Drogo will\\ndrag her behind his horses up the \\nMother of Mountains\\n. Daenerys agrees to translate instead. After hearing the\\ntranslation, Drogo makes a statement in Dothraki and steps down from the high bench with his bloodriders. Viserys\\nasks and Daenerys translates: “You shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.” Viserys\\nsmiles and declares that that is all he ever wanted. His smile is what saddens Daenerys the most.\\nDrogo orders his bloodriders to seize the man who was her brother, breaking his arm and taking away his sword in\\nthe process. Drogo puts his belt of golden medallions into an emptied stew pot. Viserys finally realizes what is\\nhappening and begins to plead and struggle. Ser Jorah tells Daenerys to look away, but she refuses. When the gold is\\nhalf melted, Drogo declares “Crown for Cart King!” and upends the pot over Viserys’ head. Soon it is over; not a\\ndrop of blood is spilled. Daenerys thinks, surprisingly calmly, that Viserys was no dragon, because fire cannot kill a\\ndragon.\\nNavigation:\\nDaenerys IV\\n↑\\nEddard XII\\n ←\\nDaenerys V\\n→ \\nEddard XIII\\n↓\\nDaenerys VI\\n\\nA Game of Thrones - Chapter 47: Eddard XIII\\nPlace(s): \\nKing's Landing\\n \\n \\nNavigation:\\nEddard XII\\n↑\\nDaenerys V\\n ←\\nEddard XIII\\n→ \\nJon VI\\n↓\\nEddard XIV\\nNed\\n learns that King \\nRobert\\n has been mortally wounded by a boar.

The \\nKings of Winter\\n watch him with eyes of ice\\nand the \\ndirewolves\\n at their feet snarl. Finally, he comes to the tomb where \\nhis father\\n sleeps with \\nLyanna\\n and\\nBrandon\\n beside him. Lyanna's statue whispers, “Promise me, Ned,” and her eyes weep blood.

The room smells of smoke, blood, and death. Tattered and blood-stained clothes litter the\\nfloor. Ned can see that his friend is dying. Renly explains that it was a boar, and Robert curses himself for drinking\\ntoo much wine and missing his thrust. When Ned asks where the rest of them were, Renly explains that Robert had\\ncalled everyone off to try to take the boar himself. Ned lifts the blanket and verifies that they have done what they\\ncan to\", ', but Aemon chose to abide by his vows even after the \\nHigh Septon\\n offered to absolve\\nhim. Therefore, his younger brother, \\nAegon V Targaryen\\n, was named king, and became known as \"the Unlikely\"\\nbecause (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that\\nthose dissatisfied with his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so he became a member of the Night’s Watch and\\nremained at the Wall while his brother’s descendents ruled as kings until \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n put an end to the line of\\nthe \\nDragonkings\\n.\\nMormont’s raven begins repeating the word “king.” Jon notes that the bird seems to like the word, and jests that\\nperhaps the raven believes Mormont should have a crown.

Mormont explains that Jon and Aemon have\\nsomething in common: a king for a brother. Jon points out that they also share a vow. Mormont comments that if he\\nhad a man for every vow he has seen broken the Wall would never lack for defenders. Jon says he always knew\\nRobb would be Lord of Winterfell, but Mormont insists that a king is a different thing:\\nThey will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and\\ndie in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You’ll have no wife, nor will\\nyou ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve.

There is no gold, or silver, or gems; bronze and\\niron are the metals of winter, dark and strong.\\nAs the guards bring in the captive, Robb lays his sword across his knees in the customary gesture of hostility. As Ser\\nCleos Frey\\n is forced to his knees, Catelyn reflects that he does not look like a \\nLannister\\n. Although his mother Lady\\nGenna\\n is sister to Lord \\nTywin Lannister\\n, Ser Cleos has inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of\\nhis father, Ser ', \" especially for the tourney, and worth good money. Ser Barristan does not know if\\nSer Hugh had even finished paying the smith. Ned replies that the boy paid dearly, and orders the silent sisters to\\nhave the armor sent to the boy’s mother. Ser Barristan continues to walk with Ned and informs him that King \\nRobert\\nintends to fight in the melee. Ned already knows. When Ser Barristan suggests that drunken words are often\\nforgotten in the morning, Ned insists that Robert will remember.\\nAs they approach the king’s pavilion, they hear Robert raging at his squires, \\nTyrek\\n and \\nLancel\\n. When they enter the\\ntent, Robert complains that his squires cannot even put a man’s armor on him properly, but Ned tells him the boys\\nare not at fault—Robert is too fat for his armor.

After the squires run out,\\nRobert and Ser Barristan laugh and even Ned smiles at the thought of the boys asking for the non-existent device.\\nNed asks if the two squires are from \\nHouse Lannister\\n.

Robert takes this opportunity to complain about \\nCersei\\n’s audacity in telling him he should not\\nparticipate in the melee, and he claims \\nLyanna Stark\\n would not have done such a thing. Ned insists Robert did not\\nreally know Lyanna, and that she would have told him he had no business fighting in the melee. This does not\\ndissuade Robert, who insists that—unlike Ned—he still has juices running in his veins. When Ser Barristan speaks\\nup to explain that no man would dare to strike a king during the melee, Robert is furious and sends Ser Barristan\\naway, but orders Ned to stay and to drink.\\nRobert laments to Ned that he was never so alive as when he was winning the throne or so dead as after it was won.\\nHe declares that Ned or Jon Arryn should have been the king, but Ned reminds Robert that he had the best claim.\\nThe king declares that he had not wanted to marry after Lyanna’s death and that it was \\nJon Arryn\\n who recommended\\nCersei Lannister. Robert admits that Cersei is beautiful, but insists that she is cold and that Jon Arryn was a fool for\\nrecommending the marriage; Robert only agreed to it so he'd have the wealth and might of \\nTywin Lannister\\n on his\\nside should \\nViserys Targaryen\\n ever return to claim the throne.\\nRobert also apologizes to Ned for the death of Sansa’s \\ndirewolf\\n, admitting that he is sure \\nJoffrey\\n lied regarding the\\nincident\\n. He continues that he dreams of giving up the crown and becoming a \\nsellsword\\n in the \\nFree Cities\\n, but the\\n\\nthought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear stops him. Robert asks Ned how he could have\\nmade a son like Joffrey. Ned responds hollowly that Joffrey is only a boy and that Jon Arryn often despaired of\\nRobert himself when he was a child. Robert admits this to be true and claims that he turned into a good king. When\\nNed does not respond, Robert declares that Ned could at least say he is a better king than \\nAerys\\n.

Therefore, his younger brother, \\nAegon V Targaryen\\n, was named king, and became known as \"the Unlikely\"\\nbecause (as the fourth son of a fourth son) he was never expected to become king. Yet Maester Aemon knew that\\nthose dissatisfied with his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so he became a member of the Night’s Watch and\\nremained at the Wall while his brother’s descendents ruled as kings until \\nRobert\\'s Rebellion\\n put an end to the line of\\nthe \\nDragonkings\\n.\\nMormont’s raven begins repeating the word “king.” Jon notes that the bird seems to like the word, and jests that\\nperhaps the raven believes Mormont should have a crown.

Mormont explains that Jon and Aemon have\\nsomething in common: a king for a brother. Jon points out that they also share a vow. Mormont comments that if he\\nhad a man for every vow he has seen broken the Wall would never lack for defenders. Jon says he always knew\\nRobb would be Lord of Winterfell, but Mormont insists that a king is a different thing:\\nThey will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and\\ndie in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You’ll have no wife, nor will\\nyou ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve.

Ser Jorah is convinced that Xaro plans to obtain one of her\\ndragons in this way. He tells her she should go east, but not to Asshai. When Daenerys suggests returning west to\\nIllyrio\\n, Jorah warns her that the Magister cares only for himself and would provide no help.

Tyrion is sending\\nArys Oakheart\\n with her as her \\nsworn shield\\n. Prince \\nDoran Martell\\n has promised to move his banners into the high\\npasses once Myrcella is safely at \\nSunspear\\n.\\nTyrion knows one of \\nCersei\\n’s secrets, how she is consorting with the unsavory hedge knight \\nOsmund Kettleblack\\nand his brothers in order to raise her own force of sellswords. What the Queen doesn’t know is that \\nBronn\\n is\\nmatching every copper she gives the \\nKettleblacks\\n, thus Ser Osmund is really one of Tyrion’s men. On the ride back\\nto \\nMaegor\\'s Holdfast\\n, things get out of hand when someone in the crowd hits \\nJoffrey\\n in the face with dung, and the\\nking sends \\nthe Hound\\n to deal with the perpetrator. The crowd, frenzied due to the lack of food and the harsh living\\nconditions, boils over and begins to trample the procession. Sensing what is about to happen, Tyrion screams for\\nthem to ride hard for the gates of the Holdfast. In the mad rush, several members are lost, and by the time Tyrion\\nreaches the safety of the gates, their lives are in doubt.\\nAs Joffrey is ranting about traitors and how they attacked him, Tyrion dismounts and slaps him so hard his crown\\nflies off, and then shoves him to the ground, shouting, \"You set your dog on them! What did you imagine they\\nwould do?\" Tyrion commands Ser \\nBoros\\n and Ser \\nMeryn\\n to return and find \\nSansa\\n and those missing, and when the\\ntwo \\nKingsguard\\n balk, Cersei begins to berate them as well for their cowardice. Sansa returns, saved by Sandor\\nClegane who is covered in blood. Meanwhile, a fire has broken out in the city, and Tyrion can see the fear in the\\nHound\\'s eyes when he commands the men to go and put out the fire.\\nLater, it is discovered that \\nPreston Greenfield\\n, \\nA', \" omen, but it appeared the \\nnight\\n they cremated her husband\\nKhal\\n \\nDrogo\\n and hatched her \\ndragons\\n, so Daenerys considers it the herald of her coming.

The other\\nkhalasars\\n hold sway to the north, the \\nLhazareen\\n to the south, and Khal \\nPono\\n is driving slaves west to \\nSlaver's Bay\\n.\\nWhen Daenerys argues that Pono always spoke to her kindly, Ser \\nJorah Mormont\\n reminds her that Pono was the first\\nto leave and will kill her now. She argues that she has dragons, but Jorah explains that the hatchlings would be easy\\nto kill, though Pono is more likely to seize them, since a living dragon is priceless. Daenerys makes it clear they are\\nhers and will never be taken while she lives, but Jorah insists she will not live long unless she goes where no one\\nelse does. Mounted on her \\nsilver mare\\n and garbed in her white \\nhrakkar\\n pelt to cover her bald head, Daenerys\\ncommands her people to follow the comet and no words are raised against it; she is the Unburnt and Mother of\\nDragons, so her word is their law.\\nThey ride by night, leaving a trail of dead horses because Pono, \\nJhaqo\\n, and the others have taken the best mounts.\\nHer people are also the weak and unwanted, so Daenerys must project confidence and strength to encourage them.\\nThree days into the march, the weakest of her people start to die.\\nThere is little forage and less water in the red waste. When supplies run low, they are forced to live on horseflesh\\nand the deaths increase. Daenerys suffers with her people; she sheds much weight and her milk dries up so she\\ncannot breastfeed her dragons. They will not eat the meat she tries to feed them until she remembers her brother\\nViserys\\n saying that only men and dragons eat cooked meat. From then on, the dragons devour several times their\\nown weight in seared meat every day and begin to prosper.\\nEach night, Daenerys lets one of the dragons ride on her shoulder, while \\nIrri\\n and \\nJhiqui\\n carry the other two in a cage\\nslung between their horses. One day, \\nAggo\\n says her black dragon is \\nBalerion\\n reborn. Daenerys recalls that her\\nancestor \\nAegon I Targaryen\\n's dragons were named after the gods of Old \\nValyria\\n, but decides to name hers after\\nthose the gods have taken from her. She names the green-and-bronze one \\nRhaegal\\n after her brother \\nRhaegar\\nTargaryen\\n, the cream-and-gold one \\nViserion\\n after her brother Viserys, and the black-and-scarlet one \\nDrogon\\n after\\nher husband Drogo.\\nYet even as her dragons prosper, her \\nkhalasar\\n withers. Some are forced to walk because there are no longer enough\\nhorses to go around. Doreah, who has been ill for a while, develops a fever and finally grows too weak to mount her\\nhorse. Daenerys stops the \\nkhalasar\\n and personally cares for the girl who taught her how to seduce Khal Drogo,\\nholding her hand until she finally dies.\\n\\nAs the environment continues to worsen, the Dothraki begin to fear the comet has led them to some hell, and even\\nDaenerys begins to despair. She goes to Ser Jorah to ask if the waste has an end. He assures her it does end, though\\nthe way is harder than he dared to think. Daenerys notes that the knight is still suffering from the wound he took\\nfighting\\n \\nQotho\\n, but he still urges their only choice is to press on.\\nA few days later, her outriders return with news of a city that even Ser Jorah can tell her nothing about. She sends\\nher \\nbloodriders\\n Aggo, \\nJhogo\\n, and \\nRakharo\\n to scout the city. When they report that the city is dead, Jhiqui insists that\\nsuch places are haunted by ghosts and best avoided. This does not dissuade Daenerys\", ' all. He leads her to the\\nentrance, warning her to always take the door to her right, and only take stairs leading up. On her way she will see\\nvisions of the past, future and days that never were, and those that will speak to her from other rooms, but she must\\nnot enter any room and keep her path until she reaches the Undying\\'s audience chamber.\\nAt the entrance, Daenerys drinks a glass of \\nshade of the evening\\n a dwarf gives her, to prepare her for the truths\\nwithin, and enters. In the House of the Undying, she notices right away that she is in the presence of sorcery.\\nFortunately, she brought \\nDrogon\\n with her into the Warlocks\\' home. Daenerys sees a great many visions during her\\njourney through the halls:\\n1\\n. \\nA beautiful naked woman sprawling on a floor with four little men with rat-like faces raping her.\\n2\\n. \\nA feast of corpses, a room full of savagely slaughtered bodies, and many of the corpses have cups or spoons in\\ntheir hands; above them sits a dead man on a throne with the head of a wolf, wearing an iron crown and holding\\na leg of lamb like a king would hold a scepter;\\n3\\n. \\nold, dead, loyal Ser \\nWillem Darry\\n beckons her into the house with the \\nred door\\n, in \\nBraavos\\n4\\n. \\nAn old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says \"Let him be\\nthe king of ashes\";\\n5\\n. \\na \\nman\\n who looks like \\nViserys\\n, but taller and with darker eyes, who says to a \\nwoman\\n nursing a baby, \"\\nAegon\\n…\\nWhat better name for a King… He is the Prince that was Promised, and his is the song of ice and fire\"; and\\nwhen the man’s eyes meet Dany’s, he says either to her or the woman with the baby, \"There must be one\\nmore… The dragon has three heads\", and he picks up a silver harp and begins to play;\\n6\\n. \\na vision of Pyat Pree telling her the visit is over, and to follow him into a garden;\\n7\\n. \\na great hall with several robed people claiming to be the Undying \\nQarth\\n, who tell her, \"We sent the comet to\\nshow you the way (to Qarth)… shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?\", but it turns out to be\\nsorcery.\\nFinally, Daenerys comes upon a room with several figures that are no more than shadows, unbreathing, and over\\nthem floats a human heart, blue and corrupted (these are apparently the real Undying). The figures speak inside\\nDany’s head:\\nwe know… the shape of shadows… morrows not yet made… drink from the cup of ice… drink from the cup of\\nfire… Mother of Dragons… Child of Three… three heads has the dragon… three fires must you light: one for\\nlife and one for death and one to love… three mounts must you ride: one to bed and one to dread and one to\\nlove… three treasons will you know: once for blood and once for gold and once for love… daughter of death,\\n\\nslayer of lies, bride of fire…\\nShe now sees visions in her head, floating faster and faster:\\n1\\n. \\nViserys\\n dying;\\n2\\n. \\na tall lord with copper skin and silver hair bearing the banner of a fiery stallion;\\n3\\n. \\na dying prince with rubies flying from his armor whispering the name of a woman with his last breath;\\n4\\n. \\na blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who casts no shadow;\\n5\\n. \\na cloth dragon amidst a cheering crowd;\\n6\\n. \\na great stone beast flying from a smoking tower, breathing shadow fire;\\n7\\n. \\nher Silver horse given to her by \\nDrogo\\n at her wedding;\\n8\\n. \\na corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, smiling sadly;\\n9\\n. \\na blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice;\\n10\\n. \\nshadows dancing in a tent;\\n11\\n. \\na little girl running toward a house with a red door;\\n12\\n. \\nMirri Maz Duur\\n shrieking in', ' the slavers that she wants all eight thousand \\nUnsullied\\n, plus all the slave boys in training, whether\\nthey\\'ve been cut yet or not.

Daenerys frees \\nMissandei\\n and takes her into her service, revealing\\nthat she can speak \\nHigh Valyrian\\n. We learn that \\nValar Morghulis\\n means \\'all men must die\\'.\\nThat night, \\nQuaithe\\n appears to Daenerys, seemingly in a dream, telling her again, \"To go north, you must journey\\nsouth. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass\\nbeneath the shadow.\" When the time for the deal to be brokered arrives, Daenerys swings the slaver\\'s whip in\\nKraznys\\n\\' face, and releases Drogon on him, shouting, \"Drogon!

He goes on to say the Dothraki cannot\\nspeak the language of civilized men, and then states that he is tired of waiting for Drogo to give him his army. Ser\\nJorah tells Viserys that Drogo will honor his promise in his own time. Fortunately, few of the Dothraki can\\nunderstand the Common Tongue. After Viserys leaves, Ser Jorah explains that the Dothraki are not merchants and\\ndo not trade; despite what Viserys thinks, Khal Drogo considers Daenerys a gift and will eventually give a gift in\\nreturn.\\nDaenerys points out that it is not right to make her brother wait, and says Viserys believes he can sweep the \\nSeven\\nKingdoms\\n with 10,000 Dothraki. Ser Jorah snorts that Viserys could not sweep a stable with 10,000 brooms.\\nDaenerys asks whether it would be possible for someone stronger than Viserys. Ser Jorah tells her that when he first\\ncame to \\nEssos\\n he saw the Dothraki as half-naked barbarians and believed that a thousand good knights could put a\\nhundred times as many Dothraki to flight. Now he is not so sure; the Dothraki are better riders, their bows (wielded\\nfrom horseback) have a longer range, and there are so many of them. Drogo alone commands 40,000 men, the same\\nnumber that \\nRhaegar\\n brought to the \\nBattle of the Trident\\n, and only a tenth of Rhaegar's men were knights. When\\nRhaegar died, many fled the field and such a rabble would not last long against 40,000 Dothraki. However, the\\nDothraki have no patience for siegecraft and if the armies of \\nWesteros\\n stayed behind their castle walls they could\\nhold out forever. \\nRobert Baratheon\\n might be fool enough to give them battle, but the men around him are not:\\nStannis Baratheon\\n, \\nTywin Lannister\\n, and \\nEddard Stark\\n. The way he says the last name leads Daenerys to ask if Ser\\nJorah hates the man. Ser Jorah replies that Eddard Stark took everything he loved from him for a few lice-ridden\\npoachers and his precious honor.\\n\\nThey arrive at the city, which is both the largest and the smallest Daenerys has ever seen; it sprawls ancient,\\narrogant, and empty across the plain. The buildings are all different. Ser Jorah explains that they are built by slaves\\nin the fashion they were familiar with. He also explains that the only permanent residents are the \\ndosh khaleen\\n, the\\nwidows of all the \\nkhals\\n who have come before, yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house all the \\nkhalasars\\n if they\\nshould all return at once, as is prophesized.\\nWhen they near the eastern market and dismount, each rider gives up all his weapons to a waiting slave, for in Vaes\\nDothrak no man may carry steel or spill blood. The palace of Khal Drogo is a massive feasting hall of roughhewn\\nlogs that make a wall 40 feet tall with a roof of silk surrounded by horse yards and hundreds of earthen houses.\\nDaenerys is met by \\nCohollo\\n, one of Khal Drogo’s \\nbloodriders\\n, who informs her that Drogo must ascend the Mother\\nof Mountains that night to sacrifice for his safe return. As she speaks to Cohollo, Daenerys recalls that the \\nkhal’s\\nthree bloodriders are his sworn brothers who share everything with him except his horses.
