-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [character, location, house, event, object, title, organization, concept, battle, region, structure, religion, creature, artifact, position, group, action, relationship, conflict, culture, tradition, mythical being, historical event, geographical feature, political entity, military unit, social structure, ideology, alliance, betrayal, ceremony, custom, disease, duty, ethnicity, faction, festivity, feud, governing body, heritage, honor, identity, institution, justice, kinship, law, legacy, lineage, loyalty, marriage, oath, prophecy, rank, rebellion, reputation, rite, ritual, rule, sacrifice, secret, social norm, status, strategy, succession, symbol, tactic, treaty, trial, truce, trust, vendetta, vow, war, weapon, worship]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Tommen
 seems to have a cold and the
current 
High Septon
 was appointed by 
Tyrion
. She wonders if she should have him removed. Tommen and Cersei
both notice the stench that is emanating from her father's corpse.
After the service, the procession of mourners come to offer condolences to Cersei. First is 
Falyse Stokeworth
, who
mentions that 
her sister
 is ready to give birth and the family would like to name the child Tywin. Cersei is offended
and brusquely forbids her. Next is 
Lancel
 who is still looking half dead. As he begins to mention his love and then
his new-found faith, Cersei heads him off by saying, "Atonement is best achieved through prayer. Silent prayer."
The only mourner to please Cersei is 
Taena Merryweather
, who promises that all her friends in the 
Free Cities
 have
been notified to watch for and seize Tyrion.
When 
Mace Tyrell
 comes before her, he mentions that his uncle 
Garth
 is on the way to assume the duties of 
Master
of Coin
. The Queen Regent, not wishing to see another Tyrell on the small council, immediately backpedals that
Gyles Rosby
 has already accepted the post. This upsets Tyrell and 
his mother
, as Tywin had wanted Garth to assume
the position. The Queen of Thorns then brings up the terrible smell in the sept, and Cersei wants nothing more than
to get rid of the clever old woman. But Lady Olenna states she will not depart until 
Margaery
 is wed to Tommen.
Leaving the Sept, Cersei rides back to the 
Red Keep
 with 
Gyles Rosby
, asking him belatedly to be her new master of
coin, which he accepts.
Back in her rooms, 
Qyburn
 pays her a visit, revealing that he discovered in the undergaoler's sleeping cell a gold
coin that dated back to the 
Gardener
 Kings of the Reach. Once again, Cersei is suspicious that the 
Tyrells
 had a hand
in Tyrion's escape and Tywin's murder. Qyburn then asks if he may experiment on the dying 
Gregor Clegane
 in the
black cells
, since he is more adept at the nature of death than any of the 
archmaesters
 from the 
Citadel
. She agrees
with his request, but tells him to bring her Gregor's head when he dies, as her father had promised it to 
Dorne
.
Finally, 
Kevan
 meets with her for dinner, as she had requested.
Cersei asks him to be Tommen's 
Hand
. Kevan first admonishes her for making Mace Tyrell look a fool in front of
half the court. He then informs her that he would rather help his son Lancel take control of Castle 
Darry
. He offers
to take up the position as Hand, provided Cersei removes herself from 
King's Landing
 and returns to 
Casterly Rock
.
Cersei is infuriated and a fierce argument takes place during which she threatens Kevan. Unfazed, Kevan counsels
her to name 
Randyll Tarly
 or 
Mathis Rowan
 as Tommen's Hand. As both men are Tyrell vassals, this makes Cersei
even more angry and she accuses him of abandoning Tommen. As he departs, Kevan reveals that he knows who
Tommen's father really is.

Synopsis
Standing a planned seven day vigil over 
his father
's funeral bier, 
Jaime
 finds himself with a lot of time for thinking.
He feels that he is as much to blame for his father's death as 
Tyrion
 or 
Varys
. He also finds himself wondering what
happened to the eunuch. His thoughts then turn to the day that Prince 
Rhaegar
 rode for the 
Trident
. Jaime had
begged not to be left behind to guard the king, but Rhaegar told him that 
Aerys
 feared Lord Tywin more than he did
Robert
, and meant to keep Jaime at his side as insurance. Mounting up, Rhaegar's last words to Jaime were, "When
this battle's done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but...well, it does no
good to speak of roads not taken." Finally, Jaime recalls his recent questioning of the 
chief undergaoler
, which was a
complete farce as Jaime knew far more than the man did, since he was the perpetrator.
When Jaime learned that the two gaolers who were put to sleep were killed by 
Boros Blount
 and 
Osmund
Kettleblack
, he reprimanded them, warning them never to act on 
his sister
's orders to kill anyone without consulting
him first. Some time in the middle of the night, Cersei visits him with news of 
Kevan
's refusal to become her

Synopsis
Brienne
 fluctuates between a fever dream and semi-consciousness, as the outlaws transport her severely injured
body to Lady 
Stoneheart
. While she is being treated by 
Jeyne Heddle
, Brienne learns that 
Biter
 is dead, skewered
through the head by a spear wielded by 
Gendry
. 
Lem
, now wearing 
Sandor
's steel dog helm, tells her that Stoneheart
wants her hanged for her "crimes". Brienne fully awakens in 
a cave
, where she meets 
Thoros of Myr
. The red priest
is a ghost of his former self, and he informs her about the current state of the former 
Brotherhood Without Banners
:
"Lord 
Beric
's fire has gone out of this world... A grimmer shadow leads us in his place... War makes monsters of us
all."
Before long, Brienne is brought before Lady Stoneheart, where she as well as 
Pod
 and Ser 
Hyle
 will be judged.
Brienne cannot see Stoneheart's face, but notices her holding a bronze crown ringed by iron swords. A northman,
most likely 
Harwin
, places 
Oathkeeper
 before Stoneheart, along with Brienne's writ signed by King 
Tommen
. The
outlaws see this as irrefutable proof that the Maid of Tarth is about 
Lannister
 business. Her words are wasted here,
as her pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears. Finally, Lady Stoneheart speaks, needing to place her hand over her
throat in order to gurgle out her judgment. Upon removing her hood, Brienne is horrified to discover that the
Hangwoman is actually Lady Catelyn Stark, albeit now a specter from the grave. Thoros reveals that it was Lord
Beric himself who administered the kiss of life to her, finally extinguishing his own unnatural life.
Stoneheart gives Brienne an ultimatum: kill Ser 
Jaime Lannister
 or be hanged. When the Maid states that she will
not make that choice, the thing that had been Catelyn Stark orders them hanged. Despite Ser Hyle's pleas for mercy,
and Podrick's stoicism, nooses are looped about all three of their necks. As they are hefted upward, thrashing and
dying, Brienne screams out a word...

Synopsis
Accompanied by six newly reinstated 
Warrior's Sons
, Septa 
Moelle
 brings word to the court that Queen 
Margaery
and her cousins have been imprisoned at the 
Great Sept of Baelor
 for adultery and high treason. The Septa reveals
that Margaery's maidenhead is not intact. Grand Maester 
Pycelle
 also reluctantly discloses to the Septa that
Margaery has had him mix 
moon tea
 on many occasions. Leaving the throne room confident that Margaery was
finished, 
Cersei
 agrees with 
Aurane Waters
' request to launch his new dromonds, in case Lord 
Mace Tyrell
 decides
to march on 
King's Landing
 to save his daughter. Lord 
Orton Merryweather
 remarks that the High Septon may want
to try Margaery himself, as the Faith used to do. Cersei hopes he is right.
Cersei has 
Tommen

Osfryd
, she orders
him to arrest Ser 
Tallad
, the 
Blue Bard
, 
Hugh Clifton

Mark Mullendore

Redwyne
 twins whom she
wants to be found innocent of the charges of bedding Margaery. The next morning, Cersei and 
Taena
 are carried by
litter to the Great Sept. On the way, Lady Merryweather inquires, "What if Margaery demands that her innocence be
determined by battle?" Cersei smiles, and replies that she must be championed by a knight of the 
Kingsguard
, but
since Ser 
Osmund
 is brother to one of her accusers, that leaves only Ser 
Meryn Trant
 and Ser 
Boros Blount
. Cersei
states that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes. Within
